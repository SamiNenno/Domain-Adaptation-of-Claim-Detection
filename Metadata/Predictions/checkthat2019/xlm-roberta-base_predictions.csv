When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Are those claims correct?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, and before we do anything, I've been abundantly clear on this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I'm president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border.",0,0,0,0,0,0

That's 45 percent of the problem right there.,0,0,1,1,0,0

"And so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, you've hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"My mom and dad -- my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.",0,1,0,1,0,1

Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's the up season.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People didn't want to have part-time jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn't get.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Everybody agrees with me on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They were part-time jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn't get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That -- my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation.,0,0,1,1,0,0
You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.,0,1,1,1,0,0
"And I think people in Florida would be surprised, because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election.,0,0,1,1,0,0
He should have won that election.,0,1,0,0,0,0

"I mean, that's on the record and people can look it up right now online.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But, again, I just want to reiterate, I think it's really important, this point.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it's fine, it's an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.",0,1,0,0,0,0

Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is about DACA.,0,0,0,0,0,0
DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional.,0,0,1,1,0,1

I am going to get rid of DACA.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And new people will not be able to apply.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In fact, I don't even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"That is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it, when the program expires, they cannot renew it, and it goes away.",0,0,0,0,0,1

Marco's position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty.,0,1,1,1,0,0

"And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it's somebody else's problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol.,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants.,0,0,0,0,0,1

Let me -- Senator.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here -- the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Justice Scalia -- in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document -- it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia -- plus there may be at least two other vacancies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So you ask Mr. Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Now, if he's changed, we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the bottom line is that, if (ph) you don't have a record there to look at and say, ""I feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States, he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood.",0,1,0,1,0,0

They're conservatives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go check it out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They are conservatives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They don't make the law.,0,1,1,0,0,0
They interpret the law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's all they do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they stick by the Constitution.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I will do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's just not get so narrow here as to gotcha this or that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think my position is clear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dr. Carson, let me wrap it up with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Are their positions clear?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, first of all, let me just add my praise to Justice Scalia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A tremendous wit and intellect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And it gives people who believe in same-sex marriage the same rights as everybody else.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"But what we have to remember is even though everybody has the same rights, nobody get extra rights.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So nobody gets to redefine things for everybody else and then have them have to conform to it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's unfair.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And this is the responsibility of Congress to come back and correct what the Supreme Court has done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why we have divided government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're going to have to encourage them to act in an appropriate way, or we will lose our religious freedom.",0,0,1,0,0,0

What kind of judgments have they made?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What kind of associations do they have?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That will tell you a lot more than an interview will tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"All of you want to repeal and replace Obamacare, so let's talk about your plans, specific plans to replace it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I want to bring in our chief political correspondent, Dana Bash.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio, you said yesterday, right here in Houston, that Mr. Trump thinks part of Obamacare is pretty good.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare.",0,1,0,1,0,0
Are you saying that you're worried he won't?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The individual mandate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said he likes the individual mandate portion of it, which I don't believe that should be part of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That should not remain there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think here's what we need to replace it with.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Otherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And if you don't have that, then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"It is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio just said that you support the individual mandate.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Would you respond?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when I'm referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I think we need it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it's a modern age.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we have to have it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK, so let's talk about pre-existing conditions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What the insurance companies say is that the only way that they can cover people is to have a mandate requiring everybody purchase health insurance.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Are they wrong?,0,0,1,0,0,0
I think they're wrong 100 percent.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"What we need -- look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians.",0,0,1,0,0,0
The insurance companies get what they want.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They got -- I'm not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they're part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And, actually, the Governor too, let's just talk about these too, OK?",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
Because I don't think the Governor had too much to do with this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there's great competition.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do.,0,1,0,1,0,1
I'm self-funding my campaign.,1,0,0,0,0,0

"We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there's serious, serious competition.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, Mr. Trump...",0,0,1,0,0,0
"... And, you're going to see -- excuse me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Right now they're making a fortune.,0,1,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, just to be specific here, what you're saying is getting rid of the barriers between states, that is going to solve the problem...",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's going to solve the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, the insurance companies aren't going to say that, they want to keep it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They want to say -- they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I know the insurance companies, they're friends of mine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The top guys, they're friends of mine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I shouldn't tell you guys, you'll say it's terrible, I have a conflict of interest.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"They're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He's not laughing so much anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hi.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Get rid of Obamacare, we'll come up with new plans.",0,0,0,0,0,0

... Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You may not be aware of this, Donald, because you don't follow this stuff very closely, but here's what happened.",0,0,1,0,0,0
When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare.,0,1,0,1,1,1
"All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund.",0,1,0,1,1,0
"The insurance companies are not in favor of me, they hate that.",0,0,1,0,0,1
They're suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"Here's what you didn't hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What is your plan?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I understand the lines around the state, whatever that means.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is not a game where you draw maps...,0,0,0,0,0,0

The biggest problem...,0,0,0,0,0,0

What else is part of your healthcare plan...,0,0,0,0,0,0
The lines around the states...,0,0,0,0,0,0

"... Alright, (inaudible)...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
... His plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was the plan...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"They'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Alright...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, that's the only part of the plan?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Just the lines?,0,0,0,0,0,0

The nice part of the plan -- you'll have many different plans.,0,0,0,1,0,0

OK...,0,0,0,0,0,0
If you could talk a little bit more about your plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know you talked about...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... We're going to have many different plans because...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... Can you be a little specific...,0,0,0,0,0,0

Is there anything else you would like to add to that...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, there's nothing to add.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0

What is to add?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you both.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Alright.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Kasich, you've said it is, quote, ""Un American to deny someone health insurance if they have a preexisting condition.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
Would you leave the individual mandate in place requiring all Americans to purchase insurance?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I wouldn't.",0,1,0,0,0,0
And -- but that doesn't matter when it comes to the issue of preexisting conditions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You don't want any American to lose their house, everything they've saved, because they get sick.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, I think it is more complicated than what we've heard here tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're actually running significant health reform in my state.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I would repeal Obamacare for a variety of reasons.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would take some of the federal resources, combine it with the freed-up Medicaid program, which I would send back to the states, and cover the people who are currently the working poor because we don't want to have tens of millions of Americans losing their health insurance.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And then we're driving towards total transparency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If any of you here ever get a hospital bill, it's easier to interpret the Dead Sea scrolls than to understand your hospital bill.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The fact is what we need is transparency with hospitals and with the providers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll tell you what we will do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are actually going to make payments to physicians and to hospitals who actually deliver healthcare with great quality at low prices.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We actually are going to make the market work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, let me just go back to the original question about the individual mandate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 1994 when you were in Congress, you proposed a plan requiring an individual mandate.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So what changed?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Dana, the Heritage Foundation had this position as well.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And when I look at it, I don't think it's tenable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we don't need to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, I'm telling you that we are going to -- we have a proposal, a plan that we're enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you're providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint -- some charge high, some charge low.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because if you think about your own deductibles today, they're going higher, higher and higher.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And you know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At some point, people can't afford it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Our plan will work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It uses the market.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It uses transparency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It gets the patient in the middle.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And guess what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And if this will go -- this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what's going on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance, even if they have a preexisting condition.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We don't want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So that's really what we're doing.,0,0,0,1,0,0
This is not a theory.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This is what we are actually doing in our state.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what?",0,0,0,0,0,0
They will get a financial reward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our primary care physicians need help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They need support.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're losing them.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Kasich, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dr. Carson, you have dealt with the sickest of patients.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You support covering preexisting conditions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"How would you change Obamacare, but maintain that coverage?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"I propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And we give it to everybody from birth until death.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They can pass it on when they die.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man.,0,0,0,1,0,0
It gives you enormous flexibility.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody's going to hide his cigarettes because they're all interested in what's going on there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Also, the -- your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So, it's like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"One costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"You can buy the $1,500 one.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That will take care of 75 percent of the people.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Medicaid.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What's the Medicaid budget?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But do the math.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all -- they will have a lot more flexibility.",0,0,0,1,0,1
What could you buy with that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
A concierge practice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you could still have thousands of dollars left over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And let me just finish, because I don't get to talk that much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, let's...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... you can have the money that's left over to buy your catastrophic insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care, but drug care and everything else.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"It will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and that's probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still de-fund it.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Dr. Carson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's talk about the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's talk about...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wolf, Wolf, Wolf.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to move on, but there'll be plenty of opportunities for you to address...",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's kind of an issue I have a long history with.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know you do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And -- all right, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0

You're very good at...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"On Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I want to end it because it goes too far, it's killed millions of jobs, and it's hurting people's health care.",1,1,1,1,0,1
Donald wants to end it because he says it doesn't go nearly far enough.,0,0,1,1,0,0
And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"What he's said is government should pay for everyone's health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now let me tell you if you're a small business owner, Donald Trump's socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare, and if you're elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where it's been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don't get that hip replacement, you don't get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care.",0,1,1,1,0,1
I'll tell you this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
As president...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will repeal every word of Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He goes around saying oh, he wants it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do not want socialized medicine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do agree with him that it's going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what's going on.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"That's why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn't work, number two, premium.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more.",0,1,0,1,0,1
We have to get rid of Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is going to destroy our economy completely.,0,1,1,0,0,0
Our economy is not doing well.,0,0,0,1,0,0
It is going to destroy our economy greatly.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"And on that, I agree.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Donald, true or false, you've said the government should pay for everyone's health care.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That's false.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You've never said that?,0,1,0,0,0,0
"No, I said it worked in a couple of countries...",0,0,0,1,0,1
But you've never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"No, I did not.",0,1,0,1,0,0
No I did not.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don't support socialized health care, you have no heart.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Correct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Have you said you're a liberal on health care?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me talk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
If people...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Talk away.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Explain your plan, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
If people -- my plan is very simple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will not -- we're going to have private -- we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I'm president.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You may let it and you may be fine with it...,0,0,0,0,0,0
So does the government pay for everyone's health care?,0,0,0,0,0,1
I'm not fine with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to take those people...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes or no.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just answer the question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We're going to make great deals on it, but we're not going to let them die in the streets.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Who pays for it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, can I just clarify something?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentleman, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wolf, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to clarify something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Gentlemen please.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to move on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a Republican debate, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because that attack about letting people die in the streets...,0,0,1,0,0,0
I want to talk about the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentleman, gentleman.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All of you have agreed -- Senator Cruz...,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Call it what you want.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a yes or no.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All of you have agreed -- all of you have agreed to the rules.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to move on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're talking about the economy right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you want to cut taxes more than President Ronald Reagan did, more than President George W. Bush did.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"The Independent Tax Foundation says the cost to the country of your proposal would be about $10 trillion, and that takes into account the economic growth that would emerge from your proposed tax cuts.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"How would you cut $10 trillion over 10 years, but make sure the country isn't saddled with even more debt?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because the country will become a dynamic economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll be dynamic again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you look at what's going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax.",1,0,0,1,0,1
We have the highest taxes in the world.,1,1,0,1,0,1
It's shutting off our economy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It's shutting off our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have trillions of dollars outside that we can't get in.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We will have a dynamic economy again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What specific cuts will you make to pay for that tax cut?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to make many cuts in business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're getting rid of -- we're going to get rid of so many different things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Department of Education -- Common Core is out.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We're going local.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Have to go local.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Environmental protection -- we waste all of this money.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We're going to bring that back to the states.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're going to have other (inaudible) many things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump -- Mr. Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you eliminate completely the Department of Education, as you have proposed, that's about $68 billion.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"If you eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency, that's about $8 billion.",0,1,0,1,0,1
That's about $76 billion for those two agencies.,0,1,0,1,0,1
The current deficit this year is $544 billion.,0,1,0,1,0,1
Where are you going to come up with the money?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place.",0,0,1,0,0,0

Governor Kasich.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"When you were in Congress, you were chairman of the Budget Committee.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You helped craft the last balanced budget the United States had.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Can Mr. Trump's plan work?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I've done it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, I -- we got the budget balanced.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We cut the capital gains tax.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington -- every single one of them -- and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt.",0,1,0,1,0,1
And why do you do it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because you want job growth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you don't have regulatory reform, common-sense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you won't get there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You will never be able to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I -- I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have common-sense regulations, I have tax cuts -- the biggest of any governor in the country -- and we have a fiscal plan.",0,1,0,1,0,1
And it's not all -- it's not always cutting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's innovating -- it's producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Now we have a $2 billion surplus.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And, look -- I've got a plan to take to Washington, and I will have it there in the first hundred days, and it will include shifting welfare, education, transportation, Medicaid and job training back to us, so we can begin, in the states, to be the laboratories of innovation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I've done it -- I did it in Washington -- four years of balanced budgets.,0,0,0,1,0,0
No one could even believe it happened.,0,1,1,1,0,0
(BELL RINGS),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've done it in Ohio, we're growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity.",0,0,0,1,0,1

I promise you that.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Speaking of taxes...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I just want to say -- and I'm a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"OK, let me -- let me -- let me just talk about that, because I know that -- that Donald believes the energy industry is important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So do I.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But of the over 400,000 jobs that we've created in the state, we think maybe 15,000 are connected to this industry, because it's early-stage.",1,0,0,1,0,1
"See, what we've done in Ohio, and what a president needs to do, is to have a cabinet and a whole operation that's jobs-friendly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have diversified our economy.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"We -- we do have energy, we have medical devices, we have financial services, we have I.T., we just got Amazon -- their Cloud computing in the Midwest.",0,0,0,1,0,1
You know why it's happening?,0,0,0,0,0,0
(BELL RINGS),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because we're balanced budgets, we're strong, we're job-friendly, we don't raise their taxes, and if we have a president that does that in America, we will get the economic growth, and that is what this country needs.",0,0,0,1,0,1

"Romney said either you're not as wealthy as you say you are, said maybe you haven't paid the kind of taxes we would expect you to pay, or you haven't been giving the money to veterans or disabled people.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Are any of those accusations that he has leveled true?,0,0,1,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, let me just explain.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form -- almost 100 pages.,0,0,0,1,0,0
You don't learn anything about somebody's wealth with a tax return.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You learn it from statements.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I filed -- which shows that I'm worth over $10 billion.,0,1,0,1,0,1
I built a great company with very little debt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I filed it on time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I didn't ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So as far as that's concerned, I filed it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's where you find out what kind of a company.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't learn anything from a tax return.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I will say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Mitt Romney didn't file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And it cost him big league.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I've been audited every year.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Twelve years, or something like that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody gets audited -- I have friends that are very wealthy people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They never get audited.,0,1,1,1,0,0
I get audited every year.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously.",1,1,0,0,0,1
And I think people would understand that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hugh, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You told me...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you going to ask anybody else that question?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, amen, amen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
Every single question comes to me?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I know I'm here for the ratings, but it's a little bit ridiculous.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, a year ago you told me on my radio show, the audio and the transcript are out there on YouTube, that you would release your tax returns.",0,0,0,1,0,1
True.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you going back on your commitment?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I'm not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, very few people listen to your radio show.",0,0,0,1,0,0
That's the good news.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me just tell you, let me just -- which happens to be true.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Check out the ratings.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, let me just tell you something.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just tell you something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to release my tax returns but I can't release it while I'm under an audit.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We're under a routine audit.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"I've had it for years, I get audited.",0,1,0,1,0,0
"And obviously if I'm being audited, I'm not going to release a return.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"As soon as the audit is done, I love it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, Senator Rubio, Mitt Romney also called upon to you release your tax returns.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Your campaign said last spring that you would release your returns that you had not previously released.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And you said, coming out any day momentarily.",0,0,0,0,0,0
When are we going to see your returns?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, tomorrow or Saturday, in fact, is our plan to release them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And there's nothing really that interesting in them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I have no problem releasing them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And luckily I'm not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter.",0,0,0,1,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
But this is my time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is an important issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's a huge issue, OK?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.,0,0,0,1,0,1

Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0

How do you remain neutral when the U.S. considers Israel to be America's closest ally in the Middle East?,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm sure it's not his intent perhaps.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But the position you've taken is an anti-Israel position.,0,0,1,1,0,0

Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong Un?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Thirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really don't have the toughest sanctions on North Korea.",0,1,1,1,0,1
We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Because we're now starting to take a firm position.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have the attention of the Chinese.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I really don't because it not working and the countries aren't agreeing to it and the rebels aren't agreeing and Syria is not agreeing.,0,0,1,1,0,1
So It's a meaningless ceasefire.,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the Obama/Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya.",1,0,1,1,0,1
That was a disaster.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.,0,1,1,1,0,1
Another example is John Kerry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
John Kerry -- Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I voted against him.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen.,0,1,0,1,0,0
His diplomacy has been a disaster.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we're not in a strong position to win the general election.",0,0,1,0,0,0

But you called for Bush to be impeached.,0,1,1,1,0,0
"Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that's concerned.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know it and so do I.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.,0,1,1,1,0,0
Be honest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Be honest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, this was before.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The check came early.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But let me just tell you, Syria, he's saying that I was in favor of Syria.",0,0,0,1,0,0
He said I was in favor of Libya?,0,0,0,0,1,0
I never discussed that subject.,1,0,0,1,0,0
I was in favor of Libya?,0,0,0,0,1,0
We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If these politicians went to the beach and didn't do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we'd be -- at least they killed terrorists, all right?",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And I'm not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don't know what we're getting.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil.",0,1,1,1,0,1

We would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Rubio.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, a couple of points.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, on the Libya situation, we didn't topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I argued if it takes a long time, you're going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And that's what happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's where the term ""lead from behind"" came.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"On John Kerry, yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasn't appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And she was absolutely horrible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I couldn't imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because we're asking to be commander-in-chief.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald is asking to be commander-in-chief.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And he's saying these guys need to do more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
South Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And Japan contributes as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And here's why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers.",0,0,1,0,0,1
They can do that very quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can't walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Mr. Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I never said walk away.,0,1,0,1,0,0
I wouldn't want to walk away.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want them to pay us much more money.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We cannot afford to subsidize...,0,0,1,0,0,0
How much?,0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll negotiate a lot more money than you'll ever get.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it's a disaster for Israel.",0,1,0,0,0,0
I'm no fan of John Kerry.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Hold on, hold on, Governor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Cruz.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, he stated that in an interview that will be on our Web site, tedcruz.org.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You can see and hear the exact words from Donald's mouth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"With regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry's foreign policy has been a disaster for decades.",0,1,1,0,0,0
That's why I voted against him when he came up.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W. Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.,0,1,1,0,0,0
And I'll give one more example on Israel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?",0,1,1,1,0,1
"The next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London.",0,1,0,0,0,1
Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"During that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-Israel politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?",0,0,0,1,0,0

"I want to talk -- I want to talk about ISIS right now, and the federal government -- how much best to keep Americans safe from ISIS.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There's a huge battle underway right now between the tech giant Apple and the federal government.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that San Bernardino terrorist to prevent future attacks.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"Apple has refused, saying it would compromise the security of all of its customers.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And just this afternoon, they went to court to block the judge's order.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Dana Bash, pick up the questioning.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio, you say it's complicated, and that, quote, ""Apple isn't necessarily wrong to refuse the court order.""",0,0,1,0,0,1
Why shouldn't investigators have everything at their disposal?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, in fact what I have said is the only thing -- the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago -- the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Apple initially came out saying, ""We're being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device.""",0,1,1,1,0,1
That is not accurate.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The only thing they're being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode that's in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And I think they should comply with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If that's all they're asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue; Apple is not necessarily wrong here.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"But just to be clear -- just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?",0,0,0,0,0,0
To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Correct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That Apple phone didn't even belong to the killer.,0,0,1,1,0,1
It belonged to the killer's employee (sic) who have agreed to allow him to try to do this.,0,0,1,1,0,1
That is all they're asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world.,0,0,1,1,0,1
But Apple doesn't want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America.",0,1,1,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Cruz, Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Where do you stand: national security or personal privacy?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"His answer, he was on both sides of the fence.",0,1,0,0,0,0
He's now agreeing with me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so I'm glad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyone's cell phone.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone, texted with, e-mailed.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"And absolutely, Apple doesn't have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation.",0,1,1,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dr. Carson, Tim Cook, again, the CEO of Apple, says that this would be bad for America.",0,1,0,1,0,1
What do you think?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America.,0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we have the -- we have a Constitution.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We have a Fourth Amendment.,0,1,0,1,0,1
It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And that's why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So absolutely, I would -- I would expect Apple to comply with the court order.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If they don't comply with that, you're encouraging chaos in our system.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to weigh in on this please.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what the problem is?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Where's the president been?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You don't litigate this on the front page of the New York Times, where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And then you know what you do when you're the president?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You lock the door and you say you're not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans.,0,0,0,1,0,1
This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I'll tell you, that's why you want a governor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do this all the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we reach agreements all the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because as an executive, you've got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Governor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you have been very vocal about securing the Mexican border, but ISIS has called upon its supporters to conduct attacks on our neighbor to the North, Canada.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"As a matter of fact, U.S. officials have warned that it is the Canadian border which is the most significant threat.",0,0,1,1,0,1
You have said that you will not build a wall in Canada.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"When it comes to national security, and the threat of terrorism, why does Mexico need a wall, and Canada doesn't?",0,1,1,0,0,1
"Isn't that, like, closing the front door, and leaving the back door open?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, you're talking about a border that's many, many times longer.",1,0,0,0,0,0
You're talking about a massive border.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts -- you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And, you wouldn't think this beautiful place -- it's beautiful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"With the trees and the roads, and the countryside.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Their biggest problem is heroin, and it's such a shame to see it.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"They're pouring in from the Southern border, so I'm talking about great security.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I'll build it on time, on budget.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It'll be a very high wall, a great wall.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's going to be built, it's going to be built.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's going to be paid for by Canada, by the way -- maybe I'll get Canada to pay?",0,0,0,0,0,1
Got to be paid for by Mexico.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"The problem with Canada, you're talking about a massively long piece.",1,0,1,0,0,0
You're talking about a border that would be about four times longer.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"It would be very, very hard to do, and we -- it is not our biggest problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't care what anyone says.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is not our big problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it's the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in.",0,0,1,1,0,1

"I want to talk to you, Senator Rubio, about Puerto Rico.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As you know, Puerto Rico's in the midst of financial collapse, unable to pay it's debt of $72 billion dollars.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Puerto Rico is asking for bankruptcy protection which would give Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans, which are U.S. citizens, you know that -- the tools to restructure the debt.",0,0,1,1,0,1
That is the same debt the other 50 states have.,0,1,0,1,0,1
You oppose granting Puerto Rico that bankruptcy protection.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"You say that it is only a last resort measure, but the government of Puerto Rico has said that bankruptcy is it's last resort.",0,0,1,1,0,1
That that's where they are now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"How do you explain this very strong stance to the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans that vote across the U.S. , and particularly in your state of Florida?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sure, because bankruptcy doesn't work unless you change the way you're operating, or you're going to be bankrupt again.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, the problem with Puerto Rico is it's economy is not growing.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"They're coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, it's too expensive to do business there.",0,0,1,1,0,1
The tax rate is too high.,0,0,1,0,0,1
The government regulations are too extensive.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"This year alone, with all the problems they're having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"So, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"They're United States citizens, they're obviously entitled to do so, and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job.",0,0,1,0,0,0

The reason that our campaign has done so well is because we're doing something very radical: We're telling the American people the truth.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't believe that that is...,0,0,1,0,0,0

Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified.",1,1,1,0,0,1
I've been called a lot of things in my life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was a first.,1,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
And then he did say that...,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and...",0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0

(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, look, we have disagreements on policy.",0,0,1,0,0,0
There's no doubt about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders' long interview with the ""New York Daily News,"" talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When asked, he could not explain how...",0,0,0,0,0,0

"-- when asked about a number of foreign policy issues, he could not answer about Afghanistan, about Israel, about counterterrorism, except to say if he'd had some paper in front of him, maybe he could.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator...,0,0,0,0,0,0

And let's talk about judgment.,0,0,0,0,0,0

And let us talk about the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country...,0,0,1,0,0,0

I led the opposition to that war.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton voted for that.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, let's talk about judgment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's talk about super PACs and 501(c)(4)s, money which is completely undisclosed.",1,1,1,0,0,1
Where does the money come from?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she's going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think so.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"You know, let me tell you why.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You may not like the answer, but I'll tell you why.",0,0,0,0,0,0
President Obama had a super PAC when he ran.,0,1,0,1,0,0
President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulations...",0,1,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
-- on Wall Street in many a year.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So this is -- this is a phony -- this is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support, to undergird the continuation that he is putting forward in these attacks.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Thank, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to continue on this, but I want Dana Bash to continue with the questioning.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clint, the government announced yesterday that five of the biggest banks on Wall Street have failed to develop plans to dismantle themselves in the event of another financial crisis.",0,1,1,1,0,1
This is the second time in two years those banks neglected to come up with credible plans.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"So, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Something that the law not only allows, but actually explicitly encourages?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, this is what I've saying for the past year.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd- Frank.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.",0,0,0,0,0,1
There are two sections there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If they fail either one, that they're a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you're referring to, is inadequate.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Let's look at what is at stake here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I have been standing up and saying continuously we have the law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to execute under it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, you're right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The big insurance companies, the hedge funds, something that I have been arguing for now a long time...",0,0,1,0,0,0
"... Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, you were recently asked what you would replace the big Wall Street banks with if you could break them up.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You said, quote, ""That's their decision.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why would you trust the banks to restructure themselves?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, Dana...",0,0,0,0,0,0
when you said the whole business model was fraudulent?,0,0,1,0,0,0
That's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, let's start off with the basic premise.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A few days ago Goldman Sachs formally reached a settlement with the United States government for $5 billion dollars.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Now, I don't need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because they're based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"But, Senator...",0,0,0,0,0,0
The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But Senator, you didn't answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks, but why allow the banks to do it themselves?",0,0,1,0,0,1
Because I'm not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've got to be a certain size.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I don't know that it's appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions.,0,0,1,0,0,1
What we need is to make sure that they are safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dana, you know -- I love being in Brooklyn.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I'm proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That has to be the judgement of the regulators.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, there's another element to this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement.,0,0,1,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"They should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution, we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Thank you, Madam Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And hold them accountable as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, you have consistently criticized Secretary Clinton for accepting money from Wall Street.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Can you name one decision that she made as senator that shows that he favored banks because of the money she received?,0,0,0,1,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of people lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings, the obvious response to that is that you've got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"That was my view way back, and I introduced legislation to do that.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech.",0,1,1,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
So the problem response -- the proper response in my view is we should break them up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's what my legislation does.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you can tell, Dana, he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example.",0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
It is important -- it's always important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It may be inconvenient, but it's always important to get the facts straight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I called them out on their mortgage behavior.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I went to the secretary of state office, the president -- President Obama led the effort to pass the Dodd-Frank bill.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That is the law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, this is our ninth debate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You don't just say, we're upset about this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm upset about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You don't just say, go break them up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have a law, because we are a nation of laws.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Thank you, Madam Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I support Dodd-Frank, but I have consistently said that's not enough.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We've got to include the shadow banking sector.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton called them out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So they must have been very, very upset by what you did.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Look, here is the difference and here is the clear difference.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These banks, in my view, have too much power.",0,1,1,0,0,0
They have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"If elected president, I will break them up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have got legislation to do that, end of discussion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, if I may, Senator Sanders keeping bringing up the speeches that you gave to Goldman Sachs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I'd like to ask you, so you've said that you don't want to release the transcripts, until everybody does it, but if there's nothing in those speeches that you think would change voters' minds, why not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed?",0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, first of all -- first of all, there isn't an issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York, I did stand up to the banks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I did make it clear that their behavior would not be excused.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Now, if you're going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, you've got to look at the whole picture.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"It was a giant insurance company, AIG.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not saying that Senator Sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives...,0,0,1,1,0,1
Madam Secretary...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... but the fact is he did.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And that contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and started the cascade...,0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, one second, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, the question was about the transcripts of the speeches to Goldman Sachs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Why not release them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have said, look, there are certain -- there are certain expectations when you run for president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a new one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I've said, if everybody agrees to do it -- because there are speeches for money on the other side.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you this, there is -- there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go -- you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I've released 30 years of tax returns.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And I think every candidate, including Senator Sanders and Donald Trump, should do the same.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, we're going to get to the tax returns later, but just to put a button on this, you're running now for the Democratic nomination.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it is your Democratic opponent and many Democratic voters who want to see those transcripts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not about the Republicans...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, let's set the same standard for everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When everybody does it, OK, I will do it, but let's set and expect the same standard on tax returns.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Everybody does it, and then we move forward.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I will do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that I gave on Wall Street behind closed doors, not for $225,000, not for $2,000, not for two cents.",0,0,0,1,0,1
There were no speeches.,0,1,0,1,0,0

"And second of all, of course we will release our taxes.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Jane does our taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've been a little bit busy lately.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You'll excuse us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we will...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator...,0,0,0,0,0,0
We will get them out.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Which one?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Last year's.,0,0,0,0,0,0
2014?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What about 2013, all the other ones?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You'll get them, yes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, look, I don't want to get anybody very excited.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They are very boring tax returns.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"No big money from speeches, no major investments.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unfortunately -- unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And that's what that will show.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, Senator, just to be clear, tomorrow you will release the 2014 tax returns from you and your family?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what about the earlier ones?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What's the problem... SANDERS: Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What's taking so long?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because you just have to go to the filing cabinet, make a copy, and release them.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wolf, the answer is, you know, what we have always done in my family is, Jane does them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And she's been out on the campaign trail.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We will get them out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll get them out very shortly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not a big deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, Senator, you've slammed companies like General Electric and Verizon for moving jobs outside of the United States.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Yesterday, the CEO of Verizon called your views contemptable and said in your home state of Vermont Verizon has invested more than $16 million and pays millions of dollars a year to local businesses.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"He says you are, quote, ""uninformed on this issue"" and disconnected from reality.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Given your obvious contempt for large American corporations, how would you as president of the United States be able to effectively promote American businesses around the world?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, for a start, I would tell the gentleman who's the CEO at Verizon to start negotiating with the Communication Workers of America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And this is -- this is a perfect example, Wolf, of the kind of corporate greed which is destroying the middle class of this country.",0,0,1,0,0,0
This gentleman makes $18 million a year in salary.,0,0,0,1,0,1
That's his -- that's his compensation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This gentleman is now negotiating to take away health care benefits of Verizon workers, outsource call center jobs to the Philippines, and -- and trying to create a situation where workers will lose their jobs.",0,0,1,1,0,1
He is not investing in the way he should in inner cities in America.,0,0,1,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, but the question was, the question was, given your contempt for large American corporations, as president, how would you be able to promote American business around the world?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, the word contempt is not right.",0,0,1,0,0,0
There are some great businesses who treat their workers and the environment with respect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Verizon happens not to be one of them.,0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what we need to do is to tell this guy Immelt, who's the head of General Electric, he doesn't like me, well, that's fine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He has outsourced hundreds of thousands of decent-paying jobs throughout the world...,0,1,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- cut his workforce here substantially and in a given year, by the way, it turns out that both Verizon and General Electric, in a given year, pay nothing in federal income tax despite making billions in profits.",0,1,1,1,0,1
(BOOS),0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Senator, experts say that no matter the means to bring back these jobs to the United States, prices of goods for consumers in the United States would go up, which would disproportionately impact the poor and middle class.",0,0,1,1,0,1
So how do you bring back these jobs to the United States without affecting the cost of goods to America's middle class and poor?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, for a start, we're going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And number two, while it is true we may end up paying a few cents more for a hamburger in McDonald's, at the end of the day, what this economy desperately needs is to rebuild our manufacturing sector with good-paying jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"We cannot continue to sustain the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs that we have seen over the last 20, 30 years, based on trade agreements of which Secretary Clinton has voted for almost every one of those.",0,1,1,1,0,1
That has got to change.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary...,0,0,0,0,0,0

-- Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, first of all, I do have a very comprehensive plan to create more jobs and I think that has to be at the center of our economic approach.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And so I think it is important that we do more on manufacturing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I went to Syracuse and laid out a $10 billion plan that would, I believe, really jump-start advanced manufacturing.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I have seen the results of what can happen when we have the government cooperating with business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's exactly what I will do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I was secretary of State, I helped to lead the way to increased exports of American good around the world, which supports tens of thousands of jobs.",0,1,0,1,0,1
So I think you've got to go at this with a sense of how to accomplish the goal we are setting -- more good jobs with rising incomes for people everywhere from inner cities to rural areas to every distressed community in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's exactly what my plan would bring about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we have a pretty good record if we look at what happened...,0,0,0,0,0,0

You stood on the stage with Governor Cuomo in support of new legislation to raise New York's minimum wage to $15 an hour.,0,0,0,0,0,1

It's a model for the nation and that's what I will do as president.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12.,0,0,0,1,1,1
There's a difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0

All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary?,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have said from the very beginning that I supported the fight for $15.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I supported those on the front lines of the fight for -- it happens to be true.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I also -- I supported the $15 effort in L.A.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I supported in Seattle.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I supported it for the fast food workers in New York.,0,0,0,1,0,0

Going from $7.25 to $12 is a huge difference.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Thirty-five million people will get a raise.,0,0,0,0,0,1
One in four working mothers will get a raise.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I want to get something done.,0,0,0,0,0,0

(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think the secretary has confused a lot of people.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I don't know how you're there for the fight for $15 when you say you want a $12-an-hour national minimum wage.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Now, in fact -- in fact, there is an effort, Patty Murray has introduced legislation for $12 minimum wage.",0,0,0,1,0,1

I introduced legislation for $15 an hour minimum wage which is better.,0,0,0,1,0,1

"We're going to turn to another critically important issue right now, guns in America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you've said that Vermont, Senator Sanders' home state, has, quote, ""the highest per capita number of guns that end up committing crimes in New York.""",0,1,1,1,0,1
But only 1.2 percent of the guns recovered in New York in 2014 were from Vermont.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"Are you seriously blaming Vermont, and implicitly Senator Sanders, for New York's gun violence?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"No, of course not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is -- this is a serious difference between us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what I want to start by saying -- it's not a laughing matter -- 90 people on average a day are killed or commit suicide or die in accidents from guns, 33,000 people a year.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"I take it really seriously, because I have spent more time than I care to remember being with people who have lost their loved ones.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, yes, we have a problem in America.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We need a president who will stand up against the gun lobby.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need a president who will fight for commonsense gun safety reforms.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And what we have here is a big difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill five times.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"He voted for the most important NRA priority, namely giving immunity from liability to gun-makers and dealers, something that is at the root of a lot of the problems that we are facing.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Then he doubled down on that in the New York Daily News interview, when asked whether he would support the Sandy Hook parents suing to try to do something to rein in the advertising of the AR-15, which is advertised to young people as being a combat weapon, killing on the battlefield.",0,0,1,1,0,1
He said they didn't deserve their day in court.,0,1,1,0,0,0
I could not disagree more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, finally, this is the only industry in America, the only one.",0,0,0,0,0,0

That has this kind of special protection.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We hear a lot from Senator Sanders about the greed and recklessness of Wall Street, and I agree.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We've got to hold Wall Street accountable...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... Thank you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... Well, what about the greed and recklessness of gun manufacturers and dealers in America?",0,0,1,0,0,0

Senator?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the only problem is, Wolf, she didn't answer your question.",0,0,1,0,0,0
You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You asked her whether she thought that Vermont was responsible for a lot of the gun violence.,0,0,0,1,0,0
You made the point what she said was totally absurd.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I asked her, are you seriously blaming Vermont and implicitly Senator Sanders for New York's gun violence.",0,0,1,0,0,0
She said no.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"But, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Then why did she put out that statement?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I put it out...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... Excuse me, I think I'm responding now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Please, go ahead sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A statement that was refuted by the governor of the state of Vermont, who was a supporter of hers, who said, yeah, in campaigns people tend to exaggerate.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Here is the fact on guns.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's talk about guns.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That horrible, horrible Sandy Hook -- what's the word we want to use, murder, assault, slaughter, unspeakable act.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Back in 1988, I ran for the United States Congress one seat in the state of Vermont.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I probably lost that election, which I lost by three points, because I was the only candidate running who said, you know what?",0,1,1,1,0,0
"We should ban assault weapons, not seen them sold or distributed in the United States of America.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I've got a D-minus voting record from the NRA.,0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, in fact, because I come from a state which has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am the best qualified candidate to bring back together that consensus that is desperately needed in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, I want you to respond to that, but why did you put out that statement blaming Vermont and its gun policy for some of the death of -- by guns in New York?",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state.",1,1,1,1,0,1
They come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.,1,0,1,1,0,1
"But let me say this -- in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And, in fact, in his own book, he talks about his 1990 campaign, and here's what he said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent.",0,1,1,1,0,0
"So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA.",0,1,0,1,1,1
"Voting -- he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Thankfully, enough people finally voted for it to keep guns out of the hands of who should not have them.",0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, I want you to respond, but I also want you to respond to this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You recently said you do not think crime victims should be able to sue gun makers for damages.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"The daughter of the Sandy Hook Elementary School who was killed back in the 2012 mass shooting, says you owe her and families an apology.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Do you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"But, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them -- somebody walks in.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I don't think I owe them an apology.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"This is a -- this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.",0,1,0,1,0,1
And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn't want a mom and pop store -- that was not the point of this.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And if he can point to any, any incident where that happened, I would love to hear about it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What was really going on, I'll tell you, because it has a lot to do with New York City.",0,0,0,0,0,0
New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The NRA came to their supporters in the Congress and said, stop it, stop it now, and Senator Sanders joined those who did.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me just reiterate -- just reiterate so there is no confusion, decades ago, before it was popular, in a rural state with no gun control, Bernie Sanders said, let's ban assault weapons, not see them distributed in the United States of America.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100,000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"Looking at the bill as a whole, do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you mentioned some of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side, there are some positive actions and changes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I think that sentences got much too long.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on.",0,0,1,1,0,1
So we have a problem.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So that's how I see it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
To tackle systemic racism and divert people in the beginning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now earlier this year, a South Carolina voter told your daughter Chelsea, quote, ""I think a lot of African-Americans want to hear, you know what, we made a mistake.""",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Chelsea said she has heard you apologize, but went on to say that if the voter hadn't heard it then, quote, ""it's clearly insufficient.""",0,0,1,0,0,0
Do you regret your advocacy for the crime bill?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, look, I supported the crime bill.",0,0,1,1,0,0
My husband has apologized.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"He was the president who actually signed it, Senator Sanders...",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But what about you, Senator?",0,0,0,0,0,0
... voted for it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people's lives.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I've seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"That's why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue, Errol, because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I also want people...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... especially I want -- I want white people -- I want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's also in employment, it's in housing, but it is in the criminal justice system, as well.",0,0,1,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, earlier this week at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, you called out President Clinton for defending Secretary Clinton's use of the term super-predator back in the '90s when she supported the crime bill.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Why did you call him out?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because it was a racist term, and everybody knew it was a racist term.",0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, much of what Secretary Clinton said was right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We had a crime bill.,0,1,0,1,0,0
I voted for it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
It had the Violence Against Women Act in it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When as mayor of Burlington, we worked very hard to try to eliminate domestic violence.",0,0,0,1,0,1
This took us a good step forward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're talking about the weapon that killed the children in Sandy Hook.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"This banned assault weapons, not insignificant.",0,1,1,0,0,0
But where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system.,0,0,1,1,0,1
We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"And in my view, what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that means, for a start -- and we don't talk about this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The media doesn't talk about it -- you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed.,0,0,0,1,0,1
You know what I think?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids, not jails and incarceration.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And I'll tell you what else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll tell you what else I think.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that is, we have got -- and this is the difference between the secretary and myself as I understand it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Too many lives... BLITZER: Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Too many lives have been destroyed because people possessed marijuana, millions over a 30-year period.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And that is why I believe we should take marijuana out of the federal Controlled Substance Act.,0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's -- let's get Secretary Clinton's response.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, look, I think that, as Senator Sanders said about what I said, I will say about what he said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that we recognize that we have a set of problems that we cannot ignore and we must address.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that is why I have been promoting for my entire adult life, I think, the idea of investing early in kids, early childhood education, universal pre-K, like what Mayor de Blasio brought to New York.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We have got to help more kids get off to a good start.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Your time's up, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, I have a question for you related to this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So you've said that by the end of your first term as president, the U.S. will no longer lead the world in mass incarceration.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"To fulfill that promise, you'd have to release roughly half a million prisoners.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"How are you going to do that, since the vast majority of American prisoners are not under federal jurisdiction?",0,0,0,1,0,1
We're going to work with state governments all over this country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And you know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In a very divided Congress, and a very divided politics in America, actually the one area where there is some common ground is conservatives understand that it's insane to be spending $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"With federal and presidential leadership, we will work with state governments to make sure that people are released from jail under strong supervision, that they get the kind of job training and education they need so they can return to their communities.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"On this one, Errol, actually I think you're going to see progressive and conservative support.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We can do it, if we're prepared to be bold.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to take a quick commercial break.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a lot more questions for Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders right after this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Welcome back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's turn to another critically important issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, Secretary, the issue of energy and the environment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders has said you are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry.",0,0,0,1,0,1
You say you're sick and tired of him lying about your record.,0,0,1,0,0,0
What are his lies?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And that's why for the last many years, both in the Senate and as secretary of State, it's been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried -- I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And everyone who's looked at this independently, ""The Washington Post"" and others, who give us both hard times when called for on facts, have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Best we can tell from the reports that are done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"And, let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to get to that to, but I want you to respond, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is one thing, as the Secretary indicated, to talk about workers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm sure I have contributions, you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But, as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out, gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clinton's campaign.",1,1,1,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, that's not saying -- and, then some people say, well, given the hundreds of millions of dollars she raises it's a small amount.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That's true.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, that does not mean to say that the lobbyists thought she was a pretty good bet on this issue.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, what I think is when we look at climate change now, we have got to realize that this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, it is not good enough.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, if we, God forbid, were attacked tomorrow the whole country would rise up and say we got an enemy out there and we got to do something about it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
That was what 9/11 was about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances.",0,0,1,0,0,1
There's going to be international conflict.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"(APPLAUSE) I am proud, Wolf, that I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation...",0,0,0,0,0,0
....,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... Including a tax on carbon.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Something I don't believe Secretary Clinton supports.,0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, go ahead and respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let's talk about the global environmental crisis.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State, and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, I was surprised and disappointed when Senator Sanders attacked the agreement, said it was not enough, it didn't go far enough.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, at some point putting together 195 countries, I know a little bit about that, was a major accomplishment...",0,1,0,1,0,0
... Thank you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"... And, our President led the effort to protect our world and he deserve our appreciation, not our criticism...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"... Go ahead, Senator...",0,0,0,0,0,0
... Let's talk about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you were Secretary of State, you also worked hard to expand fracking to countries all over the world.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"The issue here -- of course the agreement is a step forward, but you know agreements and I know agreements, there's a lot of paper there.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We've got to get beyond paper right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have got to lead the world in transforming our energy system, not tomorrow, but yesterday.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"(APPLAUSE) And, what that means, Wolf, it means having the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I am on board legislation that says, you know what, we ain't going to excavate for fossil fuel on public land.",0,0,1,1,0,1
That's not Secretary Clinton's position.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let us support a tax on carbon...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... Not Secretary Clinton's position.,0,0,0,0,0,0
... Go ahead and respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm a little bewildered about how to respond when you have an agreement which gives you the framework to actually take the action that would have only come about because under the Obama administration in the face of implacable hostility from the Republicans in Congress, President Obama moved forward on gas mileage, he moved forward on the clean power plant.",0,0,0,1,0,1
He has moved forward on so many of the fronts that he could given the executive actions that he was able to take.,0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, I am getting a little bit -- I'm getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, it's easy -- it's easy to diagnose the problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's harder to do something about the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll continue on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Errol -- Errol Louis, go ahead with your question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Wolf.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wolf.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to continue on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Errol, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK. Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, you also pioneered a program to promote fracking around the world, as you described.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Fracking, of course, a way of extracting natural gas.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now as a candidate for president, you say that by the time you're done with all your rules and regulations, fracking will be restricted in many places around the country.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Why have you changed your view on fracking?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, well, I don't think I've changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So we did say natural gas is a bridge.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's why I've set big goals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, Senator?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, here is -- here is a real difference.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a difference between understanding that we have a crisis of historical consequence here, and incrementalism and those little steps are not enough.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Not right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not on climate change.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, the truth is, as secretary of state, Secretary Clinton actively supported fracking technology around the world.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Second of all, right now, we have got to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And that means -- and I would ask you to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you in favor of a tax on carbon so that we can transit away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy at the level and speed we need to do?,0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I don't take a back seat to your legislation that you've introduced that you haven't been able to get passed.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's exactly what I have proposed.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"OK, thank you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And my approach I think is going to get us there faster without tying us up into political knots with a Congress that still would not support what you are proposing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, you've said that climate change is the greatest change to our nation's security.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Secretary Clinton did not answer one simple question.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Excuse me, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you for a tax on carbon or not?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a question for you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've said that climate change is the greatest threat to our nation's security.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You've called for a nationwide ban on fracking.,0,1,0,1,0,1
You've also called for phasing out all nuclear power in the U.S.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"But wouldn't those proposals drive the country back to coal and oil, and actually undermine your fight against global warming?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"No, they wouldn't.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Look, here's where we are.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me reiterate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a global crisis.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Pope Francis reminded us that we are on a suicide course.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Our legislation understands, Errol, that there will be economic dislocation.",0,0,1,0,0,1
It is absolutely true.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There will be some people who lose their job.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And we build into our legislation an enormous amount of money to protect those workers.,0,0,0,1,0,1
It is not their fault...,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is not their fault that fossil fuels are destroying our climate.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"But we have got to stand up and say right now, as we would if we were attacked by some military force, we have got to move urgency -- urgently and boldly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What does that mean?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator -- senator, jobs...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- jobs are one thing, but with less than 6 percent of all U.S. energy coming from solar, wind and geothermal, and 20 percent of U.S. power coming from nuclear, if you phase out all of that, how do you make up...",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Well, you don't phase...",0,0,0,0,0,0
-- that difference?,0,0,0,0,0,0
-- it all out tomorrow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you certainly don't phase nuclear out tomorrow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But this is what you do do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
What you do do is say that we are going to have a massive program -- and I had introduced -- introduced legislation for 10 million solar rooftops.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We can put probably millions of people to work retrofitting and weatherizing buildings all over this country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
(CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
Saving -- rebuilding our rail system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Our mass transit system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we approach this, Errol, as if we were literally at a war -- you know, in 1941, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we moved within three years, within three more years to rebuild our economy to defeat Nazism and Japanese imperialism.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That is exactly the kind of approach we need right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Lead the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's turn to another critically important issue...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
-- the issue of national security and foreign policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, President Obama says the worst mistake in office that he made over these past seven and a half years was not preparing for Libya after Moammar Qadafi was removed.",0,1,1,1,0,1
You were his secretary of State.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Aren't you also responsible for that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Qadafi's demise.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And here's what we did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was very proud of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that Qadafi had, getting it out of Libya, getting it away from militias or terrorist groups.",0,1,1,1,0,1
We also worked to help them set up their government.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We sent a lot of American experts there.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"They, at the end, when it came to security issues, Wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, European or other countries, in Libya.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And so we were caught in a very difficult position.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didn't want to have others helping to provide that security.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"And the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And we can't walk away from that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to be working with European and Arab partners...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
-- with the United Nations in order to continue to try to support them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to them",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"According to ""The New York Times.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"for President Obama, this was a pretty tough call, like a 51-49 call, do you overthrow Qadafi, who, of course, was a horrific dictator?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"The New York Times"" told us it was Secretary Clinton who led the effect for that regime change.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And this is the same type of mentality that supported the war in Iraq.,0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Look...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- Qadafi, Saddam Hussein are brutal, brutal murdering thugs.",0,0,1,1,0,0
No debate about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what we have got to do and what the president was saying is we didn't think thoroughly about what happens the day after you get rid of these dictators.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Regime change often has unintended consequences in Iraq and in Libya right now, where ISIS has a very dangerous foothold.",0,1,1,0,0,1
And I think if you studied the whole history of...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- American involvement in regime change, you see that quite often.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Secretary, we're going to let you respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, well, I...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
-- I...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- I -- I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Senator Sanders voted for that, and that's exactly what we did.",1,0,0,1,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"We went to the United Nations -- yes, he did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We went to the United Nations Security Council.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We got support from the Security Council.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners.,0,0,0,1,0,0
This was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And if you want to know what chaos does, not just to the people inside but the people on the borders, look at Syria.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Nobody stood up to Assad and removed him, and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria than we are currently dealing with right now in Libya.",0,1,1,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton made this charge in previous debates and just repeating it doesn't make it truer.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"What you are talking about is what I think was what they call the unanimous consent, you know what that is, where basically, do we support Libya moving to democracy?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, you know what, I surely have always supported Libya moving to democracy.",1,0,0,1,0,0
But please do not confuse that with your active effort for regime change without contemplating what happened the day after.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Totally different issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that isn't...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Second of all -- second of all, if I might, in terms of Syria, in terms of Syria...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, let her respond to that, then we'll get to that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Go ahead, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know you're not shy when you oppose something, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, yes, it was unanimous.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's exactly right, including you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners.,0,0,0,1,0,0
The decision was the president's.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did I do the due diligence?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did I talk to everybody I could talk to?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what a secretary of state does.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And the president made that decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans' obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Go ahead, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you listen, you know -- two points.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, yes, 100-0 in the Senate voted for democracy in Libya and I would vote for that again.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But that is very different from getting actively involved to overthrow and bring about regime change without fully understanding what the consequence of that regime change would be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Second of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Thirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, when I was secretary of state I did urge, along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad.",0,0,1,1,0,0
The president said no.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"Now, that's how it works.",0,0,0,0,0,0
People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I think it's only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Staying on national security, Dana Bash has a question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, in 1997, you said this about NATO, you said, quote: ""It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe, let alone assuming more than our share of any cost associated with expanding NATO.""",0,0,1,1,0,1
Do you still feel that way?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, what I believe, if my memory is correct here, we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Yes, I do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And just following up, Senator Sanders, Donald Trump also argues that NATO is unfair economically to the U.S. because America pays a disproportionate share.",0,0,1,1,0,1
So how is what you say about NATO and your proposal different than his?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you got to ask -- you got to ask Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All I can tell you is, with a huge deficit, with 47 million people living in poverty, with our inner cities collapsing, yeah, I do think countries like Germany and U.K. and France and European countries whose economy, or at least its standard of living and health care and education, they're doing pretty well.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies.",0,0,1,0,0,0
You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nothing wrong with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I support our continuing involvement in NATO.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is a requirement that they should be doing so, and I believe that needs to be enforced.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But there's a larger question here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, Madam Secretary... CLINTON: ... yes, of course they should be paying more, but that doesn't mean if they don't we leave, because I don't think that's in America's interests.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"That's going to be part of my -- my question to you is, to that point, there are 28 countries in the alliance, and the United States gives more money to NATO's budget than 21 of those countries combined.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"If they don't agree to pay more, as you suggested, then what would you do as commander-in-chief?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will stay in NATO.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will stay in NATO, and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Remember, NATO was with us in Afghanistan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Most of the member countries also lost soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan.,0,0,0,1,0,1
They came to our rallying defense after 9/11.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That meant a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but let's not forget what's really happening.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we've seen what they've done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Think of how much it would cost if Russia's aggression were not deterred because NATO was there on the front lines making it clear they could not move forward.,0,0,1,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, let's talk about the U.S. relationship with Israel.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, you maintained that Israel's response in Gaza in 2014 was, quote, ""disproportionate and led to the unnecessary loss of innocent life.""",0,0,1,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
What do you say to those who believe that Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees fit?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, as somebody who spent many months of my life when I was a kid in Israel, who has family in Israel, of course Israel has a right not only to defend themselves, but to live in peace and security without fear of terrorist attack.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That is not a debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"But -- but what you just read, yeah, I do believe that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Israel was subjected to terrorist attacks, has every right in the world to destroy terrorism.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"But we had in the Gaza area -- not a very large area -- some 10,000 civilians who were wounded and some 1,500 who were killed.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Free Palestine!,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, if you're asking not just me, but countries all over the world was that a disproportionate attack, the answer is that I believe it was, and let me say something else.",0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, let me say something else.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel, in the long run -- and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"So what is not to say -- to say that right now in Gaza, right now in Gaza unemployment is s somewhere around 40%.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"You got a log of that area continues, it hasn't been built, decimated, houses decimated health care decimated, schools decimated.",0,1,1,1,0,1
I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That does not make me anti-Israel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That paves the way, I think...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"... Thank you, Senator...",0,0,0,0,0,0
...to an approach that works in the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, do you agree with Senator Sanders that Israel overreacts to Palestinians attacks, and that in order for there to be peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel must, quote, end its disproportionate responses?",0,0,1,0,0,1
I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I did it in concert with...,0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"President Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah, I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President, Morsi, based in Cairo, working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I can tell you right now I have been there with Israeli officials going back more than 25 years that they do not seek this kind of attacks.,0,0,1,1,0,1
They do not invite the rockets raining down on their towns and villages.,0,0,1,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And, so when it came time after they had taken the incoming rockets, taken the assaults and ambushes on their soldiers and they called and told me, I was in Cambodia, that they were getting ready to have to invade Gaza again because they couldn't find anybody to talk to tell them to stop it, I flew all night, I got there, I negotiated that.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"So, I don't know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you.",0,0,1,0,0,0
You have a right to defend yourself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
That does not mean -- that does not mean that you don't take appropriate precautions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, I understand that there's always second guessing anytime there is a war.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It also does not mean that we should not continue to do everything we can to try to reach a two-state solution, which would give the Palestinians the rights and...",0,0,0,0,0,1
... Thank you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... just let me finish.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The rights and the autonomy that they deserve.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator, go ahead -- go ahead, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think that anybody would suggest that Israel invites and welcomes missiles flying into their country.,0,0,1,0,0,1
That is not the issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you evaded the answer.",0,0,0,1,0,0
You evaded the question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The question is not does Israel have a right to respond, nor does Israel have a right to go after terrorists and destroy terrorism.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That's not the debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Was their response disproportionate?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe that it was, you have not answered that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
(CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
I will certainly be willing to answer it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think I did answer it by saying that of course there have to be precautions taken but even the most independent analyst will say the way that Hamas places its weapons, the way that it often has its fighters in civilian garb, it is terrible.",0,0,1,0,0,1
(AUDIENCE REACTION),0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not saying it's anything other than terrible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It would be great -- remember, Israel left Gaza.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They took out all the Israelis.,0,1,0,1,0,0
They turned the keys over to the Palestinian people.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And what happened?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hamas took over Gaza.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I read Secretary Clinton's statement speech before AIPAC.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I heard virtually no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Almost none in that speech.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"So here is the issue: of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an even-handed role trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That is what I believe the world wants to us do and that's the kind of leadership that we have got to exercise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, if I -- I want to add, you know, again describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I have been involved, both as first lady with my husband's efforts, as a senator supporting the efforts that even the Bush administration was undertaking, and as secretary of state for President Obama, I'm the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"There were only four of us in the room, Netanyahu, Abbas, George Mitchell, and me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Three long meetings.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I believe that as president I will be able to continue to make progress and get an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever, ever undermining Israel's security.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"A final word, Senator, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There comes a time -- there comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time.",0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Well...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... you know, I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations I've had with him and other Israeli leaders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Nobody is saying that any individual leader is always right, but it is a difficult position.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you are from whatever perspective trying to seek peace, trying to create the conditions for peace when there is a terrorist group embedded in Gaza that does not want to see you exist, that is a very difficult challenge.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Senator, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You gave a major speech to AIPAC, which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis, and you barely mentioned the Palestinians.",1,0,0,1,0,1
"And I think, again, it is a complicated issue and God knows for decades presidents, including President Clinton and others, Jimmy Carter and others have tried to do the right thing.",0,0,0,0,0,1
All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are two sides to the issue.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to take another quick, quick break.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But much more on the CNN Democratic presidential debate live from Brooklyn, New York.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is coming up right after this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're here in Brooklyn.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary, Senator, both of you talk about major reforms to college tuition, health care, and Social Security, all of which will take significant changes from Congress, currently controlled by Republicans.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Senator Sanders, you're promising health care and free college for all, and those plans would be met with both political and practical challenges.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says your initiatives would cost up to $28 trillion and, even after massive tax increases, that would add as much as $15 trillion to the national debt.",0,0,1,1,0,1
How is this fiscally responsible?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I disagree with that study.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are many economists who come up with very, very different numbers.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"For example, we are the only country, major country on Earth, that does not guarantee health care to all people, and yet we end up spending almost three times what the British do, 50 percent more than the French.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"My proposal, a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program, will save...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... will save middle-class families many thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Public colleges and universities tuition free?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Damn right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is exactly what we should be doing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'd pay for that -- I'd pay for that by telling Wall Street that, yeah, we are going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will bring in more than enough money to provide free tuition at public colleges and universities and lower the outrageous level of student debt.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Wolf, we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"The establishment does not like this idea, but, yes, I am determined to transfer that money back to the working families of this country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary, go ahead and respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, again -- again, I absolutely agree with the diagnosis, the diagnosis that we've got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage, something that I've worked on for 25 years.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare.",0,1,0,0,0,0
And we're now at 90 percent of coverage; I'm going to get us to 100 percent.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And with respect to college, I think we have to make college affordable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are pricing out middle-class, working, and poor families.",0,0,0,1,0,1
There's no doubt about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I do think when you make proposals and you're running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plans...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... are actually going to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out -- remember, he had a plan for about, I don't know, 18, 20 years.",0,0,0,1,0,1
He changed in the middle of this campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He put out another plan.,0,1,0,0,0,0
People have been analyzing the new plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"In fact, the Washington Post called it a train-wreck for the poor.",0,1,1,1,0,0
"A working woman on Medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2,300.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The same for free college.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The free college offer -- you know, my late father said, if somebody promises you something for free, read the fine print.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You read the fine print, and here's what it says.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The fine print says this, that it will -- the federal government will cover two-thirds of the cost and require the states, even those led by Republican governors...",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Senator, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
... to carry out what the remaining one-third of the cost.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know what Secretary Clinton is saying.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary please.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are not a country that has the courage to stand up to big money and do what has to be done for the working families of the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton will have to explain to the people of our country how it could be that every other major country on Earth manages to guarantee health care to all of their people, spending significantly less per capita than we can.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"I live 50 miles away from Canada, you know?",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's not some kind of communist authoritarian country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're doing OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They got a health care system that guarantees health care to all people.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We can do the same.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In terms of public colleges and universities, please don't tell me that we cannot do what many other countries around the world are doing.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Kids should not be punished and leave school deeply in debt, for what crime?",0,0,0,0,0,0
For trying to get an education.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, yes, we are going to pay for it...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Well...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have -- we have a difference of opinion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We both want to get to universal health care coverage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I did stand up to the special interests and the powerful forces, the health insurance companies and the drug companies.",0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And perhaps that's why I am so much in favor of supporting President Obama's signature accomplishment with the Affordable Care Act, because I know how hard it was to get that passed, even with a Democratic Congress.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So rather than letting the Republicans repeal it or rather starting all over again, trying to throw the country into another really contentious debate, let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"... let's get to 100 percent coverage, let's get the cost down, and let's guarantee health care.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary, let's talk about Social Security, another critically important issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders has challenged you to give a clear answer when it comes to extending the life of Social Security and expanding benefits.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Are you prepared to lift the cap on taxable income, which currently stands at $118,500?",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Yes or no, would you lift the cap?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have said repeatedly, Wolf, I am going to make the wealthy pay into Social Security to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That is one way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If that is the way that we pursue, I will follow that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But there are other ways.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We should be looking at taxing passive income by wealthy people.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We should be looking at taxing all of their investment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But here's the real issue, because I -- I've heard this, I've seen the reports of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have said from the very beginning, we are going to protect Social Security.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I was one of the leaders in the fight against Bush when he was trying to privatize Social Security.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"But we also, in addition to extending the Trust Fund, which I am absolutely determined to do, we've got to help people who are not being taken care of now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And because Social Security started in the 1930s, a lot of women have been left out and left behind.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And it's time that we provide more benefits for widows, divorcees, for caregivers, for women who deserve more from the Social Security...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
-- system and that will be my highest priority.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Go ahead, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"An interesting comment, but you didn't answer the question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
If that's the way we're...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, you didn't.",0,1,0,1,0,0
My legi...,0,0,0,0,0,0

Can I answer...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I did answer the...,0,0,0,1,0,0

"Well, don't -- don't put words...",0,0,0,0,0,0
-- can I have... (CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0

-- that's not accurate.,0,0,1,0,0,0

All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Essentially what you described is my legislation, which includes (INAUDIBLE)...",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Now, we've got -- here is the issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Your answer has been the same year after year.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In fact, the idea that I'm bringing forth, I have to admit it, you know, it wasn't my idea.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"It was Barack Obama's idea in 2008, the exact same idea.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"He called for lifting the cap, which is now higher -- it's at 118 -- and starting at 250 and going on up.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"If you do that, you're going to extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"You will significantly expand benefits by 1,300 bucks a year for seniors and disabled vets under $16,000 a year.",0,0,0,1,0,1
What's wrong with that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you prepared to support it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have supported it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we are in vigorous agreement here, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have sup...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it's important...,0,0,0,0,0,0

-- to point out that...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- you know, we're -- we're having a discussion about the best way to raise money from wealthy people to extend the Social Security Trust Fund.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Think about what the other side wants to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme.,0,1,1,1,0,0
They still want to privatize it.,0,1,1,1,1,1
"In fact, their whole idea is to turn over the Social Security Trust Fund to Wall Street, something you and I would never let happen.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"All right, so...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, yes, we both want to make sure...",0,0,0,0,0,0

"So, Senator Sanders, would you ask him to withdraw the nomination?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, but here is the point, and obviously i will strongly support that nomination as a member of the Senate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, if elected president, I would ask the president to withdraw that nomination because I think -- I think this.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think that we need a Supreme Court justice who will make it crystal clear, and this nominee has not yet done that, crystal clear that he or she will vote to overturn Citizens United and make sure that American democracy is not undermined.",0,0,1,0,0,1

I think Secretary Clinton was 12 points.,0,0,0,0,0,0

(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders...,0,0,0,0,0,0

Senator Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am in this race as a Democrat.,0,0,0,0,0,0

You don't appear to have raised any money for the party.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Yesterday you did announce that you will help three members of Congress who have endorsed you.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Why aren't you doing more to help the party you say you want to lead?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I have written letter that have raised, if I may use the word, huge amount of money so that's just not accurate.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"But, I will also say, and this is important and maybe the Secretary disagrees with me, but I am proud that millions of young people who previously were not involved in the political process are now coming into it, and I do believe, I do believe that we have got to open the door of the Democratic party to those people.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And it is 1.4 million more than Donald Trump.,0,1,0,1,0,1

I think you have to look at the facts.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And, I want to say -- I also want to say that I do -- I do think it is absolutely critical and incredible that we have so many young people involved in the political process.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I applaud all of those who are applauding you, Senator Sanders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're happy that they are supporting you, that they are passionately committed to you and to the issues.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And, I know something about that...",0,0,0,0,0,0
... Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you so much.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Look, let me acknowledge what is absolutely true.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton cleaned our clock in the Deep South.,1,1,0,1,0,0
No question about it.,0,1,0,0,0,0
We got murdered there.,0,0,1,1,0,0
That is the most conservative part of this great country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the fact.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But you know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're out of the Deep South now.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And we're moving up.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We got here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to California.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We got a number of large states there.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And having won seven out of the last eight caucuses and primaries, having a level of excitement and energy among working people and low-income people doing better against Donald Trump and the other Republicans in poll after poll than Secretary Clinton is, yeah, I believe that we're going to win this nomination, and I believe we're going to obliterate Donald Trump or whoever the Republican candidate is.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, let me say this...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it's -- I think it's important for people out there watching this tonight to know that I also have a considerable lead in pledged delegates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And my lead in pledged delegates is actually wider than Barack Obama's lead was over me.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And in addition to winning states in the Deep South, we won Florida, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so I think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic, but it all comes down to reaching every single voter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not taking anything for granted or any voter or any place.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I'm going to work my heart out here in New York until the polls close on Tuesday.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to work in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware and Maryland, all the way through California.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Senator, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
... that we'll go onto the general election with.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The reason -- the reason why in virtually every contest we are winning by very strong margins younger people -- and I'm not just talking about very young.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"You know, the older you get, the younger young gets -- 45 or younger -- is I think people are sensing that establishment politics and dependence on Wall Street and big money interest is really never going to address the crises that we face.",0,0,1,0,0,1

"And people understand, you can't take money from powerful special interests into your PAC and then really expect the American people to believe you're going to stand up to these powerful special interests.",0,0,1,0,0,0
So I am very proud of the fact that we have brought millions of new people into the political process...,0,0,0,0,0,0

I believe that this country has enormous potential if we have the guts to take on the big money interests who dominate our economic and political life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I disagree with Secretary Clinton in the belief that you can get money from Wall Street, that you can get money for a super PAC from powerful special interests, and then at the end of the day do what has to be done for the working families of this country.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I just don't accept that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I believe is that this country, if we stand together and not let the Trumps of the world divide us up, can guarantee health care to all people as a right, can have paid family and medical leave, can make public colleges and universities tuition-free, can lead the world in transforming our energy system and combatting climate change, can break up the large financial institutions, can demand that the wealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of taxes.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And we can do that when millions of people stand up, fight back, and create a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.",0,0,0,0,0,0

That is what the political revolution is about.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But we also have racial barriers, gender barriers, homophobic barriers, disability barriers.",0,0,1,0,0,1

We have a lot of barriers that stand in the way of people being treated as they should and having the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I am humbly asking for your support on Tuesday.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll work my heart out for you again.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.",0,1,1,0,0,1

Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But there's also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that we can get back on the right track.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to imagine a country where people's wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I'm fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and I'm not making promises that I cannot keep.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's get started.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, ""It's very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable.""",0,0,1,0,0,1
"So please tell us why you think if he's elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and we're now on the path to achieving it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I don't want us to start over again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to build on the progress we've made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And I don't want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar.,0,0,0,1,0,1
So we have a difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I also believe in affordable college, but I don't believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trump's kids, get to be able to afford college.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to get the economy going again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's not just enough about what we're against, as important as that is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the numbers just don't add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"That's why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Let's go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A progressive is someone who makes progress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what I intend to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and haven't gotten any of these things passed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why do you think as president you'll be able to achieve big, big new programs like this?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I haven't quite run for president before.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, you know, sometimes there's a lot of drama here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here is the issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Every major country on earth, whether it's the U.K., whether it's France, whether it's Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are.",0,1,0,1,0,1
So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can't do that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government can't stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce.",0,0,0,0,0,1
This is 2016.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, how do we pay for that?",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's an expensive proposition.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation.",0,0,1,0,0,1
The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
If I could just follow up on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country.",0,1,0,0,0,0
It is helping people right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
... this is a good discussion here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And let me just say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The idea I would dismantle health care in America while we're waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here -- I helped write that bill -- but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, thank you both.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Rachel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then you're too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the party's standard bearer.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Well because I am a progressive who gets things done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the root of that word, progressive, is progress.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I've heard Senator Sanders comments, and it's really caused me to wonder who's left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if we're going to get into labels, I don't think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity.,0,0,1,0,0,1
I don't think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we've done and what we will do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's what I'm offering and that's what I will do as president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, not at all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's the reality of American economic life today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process.,0,0,1,1,0,1
The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent.,1,0,0,1,0,1
The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American people's needs and desires from what Congress is doing.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution -- contributors.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now all of the ideas that I'm talking about, they are not radical ideas.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That is not a radical idea.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you Senator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you can't be both a moderate or a progressive, but you can't be both.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just pick up on this point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been -- I'm paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think I'm a moderate.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I am a moderate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's where this came from.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It wasn't me paraphrasing her.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is what she said, and all that I said was there's nothing wrong with being a moderate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, you can't be a moderate, you can't a progressive.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit.",0,1,1,1,0,1
The world's financial system on the verge of collapse.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do I think President Obama is a progressive?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Chuck...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"... (inaudible) Clinton, go ahead...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said I'm a progressive who likes to get things done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Cherry picking a quote here or there doesn't change my record of having fought for racial justice, having fought for kids rights, having fought the kind of inequities that fueled my interest in service in the first place going back to my days in the Children's Defense Fund.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It certainly didn't stop me from taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Before it was called Hillarycare -- I mean, before it was called ObamaCare it was called Hillarycare because we took them on, and we weren't successful, but we kept fighting and we got the children's health insurance program.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Every step along the way I have stood up, and fought, and have the scars to prove it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, again...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it's important that, look, I understand Senator Sanders really trying to distinguish himself.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I understand that, that's what you do in campaigns, but at the same time let's not be -- in, I think an unfair way, making an accusation, or making an attack about where I stand and about where I've always stood.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"It is fair to say, Senator, that in your definition, as you being the self-proclaimed gatekeeper for progressivism, I don't know anyone else who fits that definition, but I know a lot of really hard fighting progressives in the Democratic party who have stood up time, and time again against special interests, against the powerful on behalf of those who are left behind and left out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, that's what we ought to be celebrating.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's talk about what we would do as President, and Commander in Chief to make sure the progress continues into the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"(inaudible) 30 seconds, and then we'll move.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's right, I mean, instead of arguing about definitions, let's talk about...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"... Well, you began it yesterday with your comments...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"... What we should do, and one of the things we should do is not only talk the talk, but walk the walk.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am very proud to be the only candidate up here who does not have a Super PAC, who's not raising huge sums of money from Wall Street...",0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... And special interests.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am enormously proud.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Never believed it would happen that we have raised 3.5 million individual contributions, averaging $27 dollars a piece.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That is what the political revolution means.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, as a Vermonter, you have almost a home state advantage here in New Hampshire.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But back home across the border, you also have a long history of running against Democrats as a third-party candidate, for governor, Senate, for Congress.",0,0,0,1,0,0
In 1988 your candidacy as a third-party candidate arguably cost the Democrats a congressional seat and sent a Republican instead.,0,0,1,1,0,1
How can you lead the Democratic Party nationally when you have not been a member of the Democratic Party until very recently?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Rachel, actually, that wasn't accurate.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"In 1988 the Republican did win, I believe, by 3 points.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I came in second.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was 34-31, I think, 19 for the Democrat.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"In that race the Democrat was the spoiler, not me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it is true...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is true, it's not to be denied, I am the longest- serving independent in the history of the United States Congress.",0,0,0,1,0,1
People of Vermont sent me to Washington as an independent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is true.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But on the other hand, I have -- when I was in the House for 16 years, I caucused with the Democrats.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the Senate for nine years caucused with the Democrats, of course.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I was elected by the Democrats to be chair of the Veterans Committee three years ago, which I'm very proud of.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And now am the rankings member on the Budget Committee, leader of the Democrats in opposition to the majority Republicans.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I am running for president as a Democrat.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if elected, not only do I hope to bring forth a major change in national priorities, but let me be frank, I do want to see major changes in the Democratic Party.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to see working people and young people come into the party in a way that doesn't exist now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you know what, I want a 50-state strategy so the Democratic Party is not just the party of 25 states.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, the person who first put out the idea of a 50-state party strategy is former Governor Howard Dean, who is with us tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected Vermonters and former officials.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Two former governors, the current governor, the current other senator.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I really appreciate that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think it's because they've worked with me, they've seen what I do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They know what kind of a colleague I am.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They want me as their partner in the White House.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's exactly what I will do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll get things done together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Democrats, Republicans, independents, we're going to make progress together when I'm president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, Senator, to that point, Secretary Clinton is raising the issue of endorsements by your home state Democrats.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She's implying that that says something about the people who know you best.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I don't see it quite like that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How do you see it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am -- will absolutely admit that Secretary Clinton has the support of far more governors, mayors, members of the House.",0,0,0,1,0,0
She has the entire establishment or almost the entire establishment behind her.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's a fact.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I don't deny it.,0,1,0,0,0,0
But I am pretty proud that we have over a million people who have contributed to our campaign averaging 27 bucks apiece.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"That we have had meetings where 25,000-30,000 people have come out.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"That our campaign is a campaign of the people, by the people, and for the people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, Rachel, yes, Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I represent, I hope, ordinary Americans, and by the way, who are not all that enamored with the establishment, but I am very proud to have people like Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva in the House, the co-chairmen of the House Progressive Caucus.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, look, I've got to just jump in here because, honestly, Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me, a woman running to be the first woman president, as exemplifying the establishment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I've got to tell you that it is...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
It is really quite amusing to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People support me because they know me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They know my life's work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They have worked with me and many have also worked with Senator Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And at the end of the day they endorse me because they know I can get things done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I am not going to make promises I can't keep.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am not going to talk about big ideas like single-payer and then not level with people about how much it will cost.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A respected health economist said that these plans would cost a trillion dollars more a year.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"I'm not going to tell people that I will raise your incomes and not your taxes, and not mean it, because I don't want to see the kind of struggle that the middle class is going through exemplified by these promises that would raise taxes and make it much more difficult for many, many Americans to get ahead and stay ahead.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That is not my agenda.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, you'll have 30 seconds to respond to that.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"What being part of the establishment is, is, in the last quarter, having a super PAC that raised $15 million from Wall Street, that throughout one's life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"To my mind, if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country, nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Yeah, but I -- I think it's fair to really ask what's behind that comment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Senator Sanders has said he wants to run a positive campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've tried to keep my disagreements over issues, as it should be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But time and time again, by innuendo, by insinuation, there is this attack that he is putting forth, which really comes down to -- you know, anybody who ever took donations or speaking fees from any interest group has to be bought.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And I just absolutely reject that, Senator.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I really don't think these kinds of attacks by insinuation are worthy of you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And enough is enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you've got something to say, say it directly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.,0,0,0,1,0,1
What...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I have stood up and I have represented my constituents to the best of my abilities, and I'm very proud of that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
... you know...,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I think it's time to end the very artful smear that you and your campaign have been carrying out...,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Let's talk about -- OK, let's talk...",0,0,0,0,0,0
And let's -- let's...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... let us talk about issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
... we both agree with campaign finance reform.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's talk about issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I -- I worked hard for McCain-Feingold.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to reverse Citizens United.,0,0,0,0,0,0
... let's -- let's -- let's talk about issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so -- let's talk about issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's talk -- let's talk about issues, all right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's talk about why, in the 1990s, Wall Street got deregulated.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Did it have anything to do with the fact that Wall Street provided -- spent billions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions?,0,0,1,1,0,1
"Well, some people might think, yeah, that had some influence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's ask why it is that we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, and your medicine can be doubled tomorrow, and there's nothing that the government can do to stop it.",0,1,1,1,0,1
You think it has anything to do with the huge amounts of campaign contributions and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's talk about climate change.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do you think there's a reason why not one Republican has the guts to recognize that climate change is real, and that we need to transform our energy system?",1,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think it has anything to do with the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil pouring huge amounts of money into the political system?,0,1,1,0,0,0
That is what goes on in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am not -- I like...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... there is a reason.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, there is a reason why these people are putting huge amounts of money into our political system.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"And in my view, it is undermining American democracy and it is allowing Congress to represent wealthy campaign contributors and not the working families of this country.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, you know, Senator, I don't think -- I don't...",0,0,1,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"... Secretary, we're gonna...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests, among whom you have named a few, than I.",0,0,1,1,0,0
And I'm proud of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, when I took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage, they went after me with a vengeance.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Today, you've got hedge fund billionaires aligned with Karl Rove, running ads against me to try to get Democrats to vote for you.",0,0,1,1,0,0
I know this game.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to stop this game.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But while we're talking about votes, you're the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000, which contributed to the over-leveraging of Lehman Brothers, which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy.",0,1,1,1,0,1
So I don't know -- I'm not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives.,0,0,1,1,0,0
People make mistakes and I'm certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What we've got to do as Democrats -- what we've got to do as Democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what I believe is that I have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what this election should be about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thirty seconds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think as Secretary Clinton knows, there is nobody who fought harder.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was on the House Financial Committee at that time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I heard the arguments coming from Democrats and Republicans -- Robert Rubin, Alan Greenspan -- about great an idea it would be if we did away with Glass-Steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Go to YouTube today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Look up Greenspan-Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Listen to what I told them then.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I helped lead the effort against deregulation.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Unfortunately, we lost that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
The result is -- was the worst financial disaster since the Great Depression.,0,1,1,1,0,1
Thank you both.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, Secretary Clinton, obviously we've touched a nerve.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to be back with more on this subject, and much more, right after this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Stay with us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK),0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, welcome back.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's get right to it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, you were talking about all of your campaign contributions and campaign finance reform.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You rail against big money in politics.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But do you realize there is one public financing system that we do have in place, and it is -- it is in place to run for president.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Why aren't you walking the walk on that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why aren't you participating in the presidential public financing system which is designed to essentially keep big money out of presidential politics?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Chuck, actually we looked at it, but it turns out to be a disaster.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"The way it is structured right now, if you make it all the way to California, you could do pretty well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in terms of the early states -- Iowa, New Hampshire, the other states -- it just doesn't work.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Your point is well taken.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe in public funding of elections, absolutely.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But this system is -- I don't know if the secretary would agree -- is currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, going on that then, why criticize her on Super PACs, and you got -- and all this when it is -- you know, that's the system?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I mean, you could be participating in a publicly-financing -- public financing system...",0,0,1,0,0,1
But if the...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... and being able to set -- being able to set an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- but Chuck, it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated.",0,0,1,0,0,1
It no longer works.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Nobody can become president based on that system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So what's the alternative?,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are two alternatives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, we looked at it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, should we do a Super PAC, but I concluded, honestly, I don't represent Corporate America or billionaires, I didn't want it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
So the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We got 3.5 million individual contributions, $27 a piece.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I think that's pretty good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, on the issue of Wall Street...",0,0,0,0,0,0
On the issue of Wall Street.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... on the issue of Wall Street, when our reporters go out and talk to people on the ground in the early states, what they tell us over and over again when they find voters who are leaning toward Senator Sanders rather than yourself is that the most frequent area of concern that they hear from those voters is the issue of Wall Street and whether or not you are too close to Wall Street.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Last night, when you were asked about speaking fees and the amount of speaking fees you got from Goldman Sachs speeches, you said that's what they offered.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Have you been too dismissive of voters' concerns about this issue in your own campaign and your own career?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well you know, Rachel, I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, I did -- when I left the secretary of State's office, like so many former officials, military leaders, journalists, others, I did go on the speaking circuit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I spoke to heart doctors, I spoke to the American Camping Association, I spoke to auto dealers, and yes, I spoke to firms on Wall Street.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They wanted me to talk about the world, what my experience had been as secretary of State.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But what I want people to know is I went to Wall Street before the crash.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was the one saying you're going to wreck the economy because of these shenanigans with mortgages.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I called to end the carried interest loophole that hedge fund managers enjoy.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I proposed changes in CEO compensation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I called for a consumer protection financial bureau before it was created.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think the best evidence that the Wall Street people at least know where I stand and where I have always stood is because they are trying to beat me in this primary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They have collected and spent as much as $6 million on these ads.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"Hedge fund billionaires, Karl Rove, another billionaire, jumped in.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And why are they doing that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
These are guys who try to make smart investments.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They know my record, they know me, they know that I say what I believe and I will do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I also have a pretty good understanding about how to stop them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I do want people to know that, and I think it's important for everybody to understand I have a record, I have stood firm and I will be the person who prevents them from ever wrecking the economy again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, you have been a critic of Secretary Clinton taking those speaking fees and having donations from Wall Street.",0,0,1,1,0,0
What about her defense of her record?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wall Street is perhaps the most powerful economic and political force in this country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You have companies like Goldman Sachs, who just recently paid a settlement fine with the federal government for $5 billion for defrauding investors.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Goldman Sachs was one of those companies whose illegal activity helped destroy our economy and ruin the lives of millions of Americans.,0,1,1,1,0,1
But this is what a rigged economy and a corrupt campaign finance system and a broken criminal justice is about.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"These guys are so powerful that not one of the executives on Wall Street has been charged with anything after paying, in this case of Goldman Sachs, a $5 billion fine.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Kid gets caught with marijuana, that kid has a police record.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"A Wall Street executive destroys the economy, $5 billion settlement with the government, no criminal record.",0,1,1,1,0,1
That is what power is about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is what corruption is about.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And that is what has to change in the United States of America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I could, let me just say that of course it has to change.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It has to change.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's why I have put forward a plan to do just that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it's been judged to be the toughest, most effective and comprehensive one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have great respect for Senator Sanders's commitment to try to restore Glass-Steagall.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I do not believe that that is enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in fact, I don't believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we now have power under the Dodd-Frank legislation to break up banks.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And I've said I will use that power if they pose a systemic risk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to go further, because it was investment banks, it was insurance companies, it was mortgage companies, all of which contributed.",0,1,1,1,0,1
So let's not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed.,0,0,0,0,0,1
My plan takes us further and it would do the job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would say that -- that folks who have looked at this issue for a long time, whether it's Elizabeth Warren or many other economists, will tell you that right now, yes, we do need a 21st century Glass-Steagall legislation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I would tell you also that when you have three out of the four largest banks in America today, bigger than they were -- significantly bigger than when we bailed them out because they were too big to fail, I think if Teddy Roosevelt were alive today, a good Republican by the way, what he would say is: Break them up; they are too powerful economically; they are too powerful politically.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And that is what I believe and many economists believe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Time to break them up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look we have a law -- look, you know, I -- I appreciate the senator's advocacy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was passed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was signed by President Obama.,0,0,0,1,0,1
It lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, President Obama signed that, pushed it through, even though he took donations from Wall Street, because he's a responsible president.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So we have a law in place.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the circumstances warrant it, I will certainly use it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And from what you say, I know you will as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that is not enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I keep going back to this because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me -- the hedge fund guys, the shadow banking guys -- is because I've got their number on all of that.",1,0,1,1,0,0
And my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we can't just fight the last war.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again, to hurt the economy, and to hurt so many Americans.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And my plan, Paul Krugman, Barney Frank, a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be, have said I am exactly on point, and the Wall Street guys actually know that.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
... she has had more people praise her plan than yours.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, we've had a number of economists supporting our legislation.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And here's where we are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The American people can judge.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.,0,1,0,1,0,1
That is a lot of money.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way they're ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages.",0,1,1,1,0,1
That is a lot of power for six financial institutions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it is too much power.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Too much economic power, too much political power, and the economists that I talk to say we should break them up.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Thank you both.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me move on to our next question here, and in fact it comes to us through New England Cable News.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, it's addressed to you, and it's about this issue of the speeches, particularly to Goldman Sachs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is what the questioner wrote verbatim.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am concerned with the abuses of Wall Street has taken with the American taxpayers money, and then she asks whether you would release the transcripts of your Goldman Sachs speeches, and then added, ""Don't you think the voting public has a right to know what was said?""",0,0,1,0,0,1
"But, let's make that bigger.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We do know through reporting that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"In full disclosure, would you release all of them?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will look into it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't know the status, but I will certainly look into it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, I can only repeat what is the fact that I spoke to a lot of different groups with a lot of different constituents, a lot of different kinds of members about issues that had to do with world affairs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I probably described more times than I can remember how stressful it was advising the President about going after Bin Laden.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My view on this is look at my record.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look at what I am proposing, and -- we have a vigorous agreement here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We both want to reign in the excesses of Wall Street.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I also want to reign in the excesses of Johnson Controls that we bailed out when they were an autoparts company, and we saved the auto industry, and now they want to avoid paying taxes.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"I want to go after the pharmaceutical companies like Valeant, and Turns that are increasing prices without any regard to the impact on people's health.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, if all we're going to talk about is one part of our economy, and indeed one streak in our economy, we're missing the big oil companies.",0,1,1,0,0,0
We're missing other big energy companies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're missing the big picture, and I have a record of trying to go at the problems that actually exist, and I will continue to do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, you sound like you want to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, I do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I agree with much of what the Secretary said, but, madam Secretary, it is not one streak.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's a fact.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And, I want to say something, and it may sound harsh, not to you, but to the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In a sense, in my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud.",0,0,1,0,0,1
It's fraud.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we don't start breaking them up, we're going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen...",0,1,1,1,0,1
"... Well, Senator, no one wants to see that happen.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I mean, look, I care deeply about this because just like you I have met so many people who had their life savings wiped out, who lost their homes, who are barely back with their heads above water.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This was a disaster for our country, and we can never let that happen again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have no disagreement about this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, I think it's a broader target list than just Wall Street, and I believe that we have to be very focused on how we try to take back the power and increase the empowerment of the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, I think I have that kind of experience, maybe because they've beat me up for so many years, and I know exactly how to handle them because I've been in the arena with them time and time again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, let me turn to, I think, where this direction is heading anyway, which is the broader issue of big business and power in our political system.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You on the campaign trail have railed against big name American corporations like Boeing, and General Electric, and Wal Mart.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But, some big businesses in this country have also been part of advancing progressive goals like that nationwide initiative to expand employment opportunities for veterans.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That was all about cooperation between the Obama administration and some very big business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Affordable Care Act, some of the thorniest problems in that bill were worked out in cooperation with big business in order to accomplish progressive goals.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Could you work with them, or have you made enemies of big business in this country with the way you've approached them in this campaign?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course I can work with them, but let's be clear.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I talked about Boeing and I talked about General Electric, what I was referring to is an outrage.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I suspect the secretary agrees request me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now you have a loophole such that these guys are putting their profits, multi-billion dollar profitable corporations putting billions of dollars into the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and other tax havens.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And in a given year, Rachel, after making billions of dollars in profit, do you know how much they're paying in taxes to the United States government in a given year?",0,0,1,1,0,1
Zero.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what we're going to do?",0,0,0,0,0,1
We're going to end that loophole.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We're going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Can I work with corporations?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely they are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we should be proud of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But on the other hand, there are many corporations who have turned their backs on the American worker, who have said, if I can make another nickel in profit by going to China and shutting down in the United States of America, that's what I will do.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I will do my best to transform our trade policy and take on these corporations who want to invest in low-income countries around the world rather than in the United States of America.,0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And with that, we're going to take a break.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll be right back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're going to get to trade and a lot of other issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Welcome back -- welcome back to the Democratic candidates' debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to be talking about America in the world, both in terms of some trade issues, but also national security.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Secretary Clinton, we're going to start with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are more than 4,000 American troops back in Iraq right now as part of the fight against ISIS.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"It has been 15 straight years of wars and multiple deployments for America's military families, who have borne such a disproportionate burden.",0,1,0,1,0,1
Is President Obama right to keep escalating the number of U.S. troops that's fighting ISIS right now?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, I think what the president understands, and what he's trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with the president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've said myself, we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraq -- that is off the table.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"But we do have special forces, we do have trainers, we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the United States is leading so that we can try to take out ISIS infrastructure, take out their leadership.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but they're doing the fighting.",0,0,1,0,0,1
We're doing the support and enabling.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I also think we've got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"To be clear, to the specific question, if that strategic goal that you're describing requires considerably more of Americans -- an ever-increasing number of Americans in Iraq and maybe in Syria, are you OK with the numbers increasing?",0,0,0,1,0,1

"Thank you, Madam Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Go ahead, Senator Sanders -- 30 seconds, your response.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK. Let me agree with much of what the secretary said, but where we have a different background on this issue is we differ on the war in Iraq, which created barbaric organizations like ISIS.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Not only did I vote against that war, I helped lead the opposition, and if you go to my website, berniesanders.com, you will see the statement that I made in 2002.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"And it gives me no pleasure to tell you that much of what I feared would happen the day after Saddam Hussein was overthrown, in fact, did happen.",0,0,1,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, I want to stay, though...",0,0,0,0,0,0
If I could -- if I could...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
30 seconds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... respectfully add -- look, we did differ.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We have to look at the threats that we face right now...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me -- let -- we're gonna -- we're staying -- we're staying basically on this topic.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obviously you've been emphasizing this difference on the Iraq war, but one place where you do agree, and one place where you voted to authorize the use of force, was in favor of the war in Afghanistan.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Right now, it is possible President Obama is going to be leaving the next president, perhaps President Sanders, at least 10,000 troops in Afghanistan.",0,0,1,1,0,1
How long will those troops be in Afghanistan under President Sanders?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think our great task is to make certain that our young men and women in the military do not get sucked into never- ending, perpetual warfare within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will do my very best to make sure that that doesn't happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with the secretary that I think what has to happen -- and let me just mention what King Abdullah of Jordan said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think he hit the nail on the head.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS, with the support of a coalition of major powers -- U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Russia.",0,0,1,0,0,1
So our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But at the end of the day for a dozen different reasons, not the least of which is that ISIS would like American combat troops on the ground so they could reach out to the Muslim world and say, ""Look, we're taking on those terrible Americans.""",0,0,1,1,0,1
The combat on the ground must be done by Muslim troops with our support.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We must not get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Can you address a question on Afghanistan?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, you can't simply withdraw tomorrow.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Wish we could, and allow, you know, the Taliban or anybody else to reclaim that country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what we must do, and what we have seen in recent months, is some progress in Iraq, where finally the Iraqi army, which has not been a particularly effective fighting force, retook Ramadi.",0,0,0,0,0,1
ISIS has lost I think 40 percent of the territory that it held in the last year.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"Hopefully, and you know, one can't predict the future, that maybe our training and their fighting capabilities are improving and we are going to make some progress in destroying ISIS.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, 30 seconds: How long are these troops going to be in Afghanistan?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have more American troops in Afghanistan than what we were talking about with Iraq.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"Oh, absolutely.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The president decided to leave more troops than he had originally planned in Afghanistan.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"We have a very cooperative government there, with Ashraf Ghani and his top -- his top partner, Abdullah.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And they are doing their very best.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the Afghan army is actually fighting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Afghan army is taking heavy losses defending Afghan territory.,0,1,1,1,0,1
And I would have to make an evaluation based on the circumstances at the time I took office as to how much help they continue to need.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because it's not just the Taliban.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We now are seeing outposts of, you know, fighters claiming to be affiliated with ISIS.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"So, we've got this arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia, and we have to pay close attention to it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have to build coalitions, something that I did to take on the Iranian nuclear program, and what I will do as president to make sure that we defeat these terrorist networks.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"You know, Senator Sanders, nobody knows who your foreign policy advisers are.",0,0,1,0,0,0
You haven't given a major foreign policy speech.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"And it doesn't sound like all the time that foreign policy is a priority, other than when you're asked about it, and you say you're going to crush ISIS, as you said last night and earlier.",0,0,1,0,0,0
You have not proactively laid out a foreign policy doctrine yet.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that's not quite accurate.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I did give a speech at Georgetown where I talked about democratic socialism and foreign policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Maybe I shouldn't have combined the two in the same speech, because the foreign policy part of it didn't get much attention.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, let me take this opportunity to give you a very short speech here on the issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think, while it is true that the secretary and I voted differently on the war in Iraq, what is important is that we learn the lesson of the war in Iraq.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that lesson is intrinsic to my foreign policy if elected president, is the United States cannot do it alone.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We cannot be the policeman of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are now spending more I believe than the next eight countries on defense.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We have got to work in strong coalition with the major powers of the world and with those Muslim countries that are prepared to stand up and take on terrorism.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I would say that the key doctrine of the Sanders administration would be no, we cannot continue to do it alone; we need to work in coalition.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"A group of national security experts, military intelligence experts, issued a very concerning statement about Senator Sanders's views on foreign policy and national security, pointing out some of the comments he has made on these issues, such as inviting Iranian troops into Syria to try to resolve the conflict there; putting them right at the doorstep of Israel.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Asking Saudi Arabia and Iran to work together, when they can't stand each other and are engaged in a proxy battle right at this moment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered because when New Hampshire voters go on Tuesday to cast your vote, you are voting both for a president and a commander in chief.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And there is no way to predict what comes in the door of that White House from day to day that can pose a threat to the United States or one of our friends and allies, and I think this is a big part of the job interview that we are all conducting with the voters here.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"All right, Senator, 30 seconds.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"(OFF-MIKE) I fully, fully concede that Secretary Clinton, who was secretary of State for four years, has more experience -- hat is not arguable -- in foreign affairs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But experience is not the only point, judgment is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And once again, back in 2002, when we both looked at the same evidence about the wisdom of the war in Iraq, one of us voted the right way and one of us didn't.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"In terms of Iran and in terms of Saudi Arabia, of course they hate each other.",0,0,1,0,0,0
That's no great secret.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But John Kerry, who is I think doing a very good job, has tried to at least get these people in the room together because both of them are being threatened by ISIS.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"Well, let me just add that, you know, I've said this before and I'm very proud of it, that when it comes to judgment, having run a hard race against Senator Obama at the time, he turned to me to be secretary of State.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration, namely whether or not to go after bin Laden, I was at that table, I was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do, on that, on Iran, on Russia on China, on a whole raft of issues.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Because I know from my own experience that you've got to be ready on day one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today, you know, to try to just say wait, I'll get to that when I can.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is just not an acceptable approach.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, at the -- at the last Democratic debate in Charleston -- I want to get specific here -- Senator Sanders called for moving as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Your campaign has criticized him for saying that.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Now that he's standing next to you here on this stage, can you explain why the U.S. shouldn't try to normalize relations in Iran in your view?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I did put together the coalition to impose sanctions.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"I actually started the negotiations that led to the nuclear agreement, sending some much my closest aides to begin the conversations with the Iranians.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I'm very pleased we got that nuclear agreement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It puts a lid on the nuclear weapons program.,0,1,1,1,0,0
"We have to enforce it, there have to be consequences attached to it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that is not our only problem with Iran.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to figure out how to deal with Iran as the principal state sponsor of terrorism in the world.,0,0,1,1,0,1
They are destabilizing governments in the region.,0,1,1,0,0,0
They continue to support Hezbollah and Hamas in Lebanon against Israel.,0,0,0,1,0,0
A lot of work that we have do is going to be incredibly hard.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm prepared to do that work, but I believe, just as I did with imposing the sanctions, you have to get action for action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we were to normalize relations right now, we would remove one of the biggest pieces of leverage we have to try to influence and change Iranian behavior.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The president doesn't think we should.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I certainly don't think we should.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe we have to take this step by step to try to reign in Iranian aggression, their support for terrorism and the other bad behavior that can come back and haunt us.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Who said That think we should normalize relations with Iran tomorrow?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I never said that.,0,1,0,1,0,0
I think we should move forward as quickly as we can.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you're right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They are a sponsor of terrorism around the world and we have to address that.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"But you know, a number of years ago, people were saying normal relationship with Cuba, what a bad and silly idea.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"They're Communists, they are our enemy.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Well guess what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Change has come.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So please don't suggest that I think we normalize relations with Tehran tomorrow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't.,0,0,0,1,0,0

"And I would say if I might, Madam Secretary -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
When you ran against Senator Obama you thought him naive because he thought it was a good idea to talk to our enemies.,1,0,1,1,0,0
I think those are exactly the people you have to talk to and you have to negotiate with.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was against it then I would be against it now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's not the way it works.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think President Obama had the right idea, and the bottom line is that of course there have to be conditions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, of course it doesn't do us any good to not talk with our adversaries...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"... Well, we set conditions on Iran.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And, who had nuclear weapons.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And, our goal there, in my view, is to work and lean strongly on China to put as much pressure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"China is one of the few major countries in the world that has significant support for North Korea, and I think we got to do everything we can to put pressure on China.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"I worry very much about an isolated, paranoid country with atomic bombs.",0,0,1,0,0,0

We know that they are deeply engaged in supporting Assad because they want to have a place in the Middle East.,0,0,0,1,0,0

What's your argument that the V.A.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, first of all, I'm absolutely against privatizing the V.A.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And I am going do everything I can to build on the reforms that Senator Sanders and others in Congress have passed to try to fix what's wrong with the V.A.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are a lot of issues about wait times and services that have to be fixed because our veterans deserve nothing but the best.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"We need 2,500 delegates to win the nomination.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, so this is not -- this is not the biggest deal in the world.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We think, by the way, based on talking to our precinct captains, we may have at least two more delegates.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"What the Des Moines Register said -- you know, there were coin -- I think there were half a dozen coin flips -- a fairly chaotic type situation.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"At the end of the day, no matter how it's recounted, it will break roughly even.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, I love and respect the caucus process in Iowa.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"See, and I don't have to say it, because they voted already.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I love New Hampshire, too, because you haven't voted, but...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"... but, look, I think people are blowing this up out of proportion.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But I think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, will you participate in some sort of audit, if that's what the party wants to do?",0,0,0,0,0,0
You good with that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whatever they decide to do, that's fine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's fair enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Good, we move on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're happy with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have more questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator -- Senator Sanders, in 1964...",0,0,0,0,0,1
Oh (inaudible).,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"See, when you are old, then they go back all these years.",0,0,0,0,0,1
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What have you got?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 1964, I heard that the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater, who was the hero of the conservative movement.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"He was, however, far to the right of most of that party.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 1972, the Democrats nominated George McGovern, who was a hero of liberals in the antiwar movement, but he was to the left of his party's mainstream.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Both of those nominees made activists very excited, and they both got destroyed in the general election.",0,1,1,1,0,0
Even Democrats who love you worry about your fate in a general election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I know you have good head-to-head polling numbers against Republican frontrunners right now.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But do you have a general election strategy that is different than the way you're running right now to try to get the nomination?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you know, a general election is different than a primary and caucus process.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But let me just say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In terms of where we are right now, as you mention, Rachel, in a number of national and state, including New Hampshire.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"For example, the last poll I saw -- there may have been a new one -- last one I saw here in New Hampshire, a battleground state, had me defeating Trump by 19; the secretary defeating him by one.",0,0,1,1,0,1
There were also pretty large margins in Iowa and Wisconsin.,0,1,0,1,0,1
These are polls.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Polls go up.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Polls go down.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"But here's why I think I will be, if nominated, the strongest candidate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout; when people are excited; when working people, middle class people and young people are prepared to engage in the political process.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small voter turnout, which by the way is why they love voter suppression.",1,0,1,1,0,1
"I believe that our campaign up to now has shown that we can create an enormous amount of enthusiasm from working people, from young people, who will get involved in the political process and which will drive us to a very large voter turnout.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If there is a large voter turnout, not only do we retain the White House, but I think we regain the Senate.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We win governors' chairs up and down the line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I believe if you want to retain the White House, if you want to see Democrats do well across the board, I think our campaign is the one that creates the large voter turnout and helps us win.",1,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, your campaign surrogates, and people who have endorsed you, have suggested that or even said that if Senator Sanders is the nominee, that Democrats will suffer nationwide and the chances will go down of Democrats holding onto the White House.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"With him here standing next to you, can you tell us whether or not you believe he would win the general election if he were nominated?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I can only tell you what I believe, and that is that I am the strongest candidate to take it to the Republicans and win in November.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And I say that with great -- with great respect for the campaign that Senator Sanders has been running.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I personally am thrilled at the numbers of people, and particularly young people who are coming to support your campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope that I will be able to earn their support.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They may not support me now, but I support them and we'll work together.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what I'm concerned about is the views of many Democrats who know their states, who know how hard it is to win a general election.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it also will push whoever the nominee is into the spotlight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've been vetted.,0,1,0,1,0,0
There's hardly anything you don't know about me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think it's fair to say that whoever is in that position, Senator Sanders or anyone else who might have run, will face the most withering onslaught.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I think that I am the person who can do all aspects of the job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think I'm the person best prepared to take the case to the Republicans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think that at the end of the day, it's not so much electability.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is who the American people can believe can keep them safe, can get the economy moving again, can get incomes rising, can build on the progressive accomplishments of President Obama.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that the coalition that President Obama put together to win twice is a coalition that I can put together and add to.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's what I'm prepared to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll stay on this issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll stay on this topic.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, just like there are some Democrats that question Senator Sanders' ability in the general election, many Democratic voters that our reporters have been running into in Iowa and New Hampshire, they tell our reporters over and over again they're worried about the emails issue, not because they don't believe your explanation, but because it's a drip-drip, because the cloud is hanging over your head and that it will impact the general election.",0,0,1,0,0,1
They see your numbers right now and they think it's the email issue as to why you're not polling very well.,0,0,1,0,0,1
So can you reassure these Democrats that somehow the email issue isn't going to blow up your candidacy if you're the nominee?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely I can.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, before it was emails, it was Benghazi, and the Republicans were stirring up so much controversy about that.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"And I testified for 11 hours, answered their questions.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"They basically said yeah, didn't get her.",0,1,1,0,0,0
We tried.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was all a political ploy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, we had a development in the email matter today when it came out that Secretary Powell and close aides to Former Secretary Rice used private e-mail accounts.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"and now you have these people in the government who are doing the same thing to Secretary Powell and Secretary Rice's aide they've been doing to me, which is that I never sent or received any classified material.",0,0,1,1,0,1
They are retroactively classifying it.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"I agree completely with Secretary Powell, who said today this is an absurdity.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And so I think the American people will know it's an absurdity.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I have absolutely no concerns about it whatsoever.,0,1,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, Madam Secretary, there is an open -- there is an open FBI investigation into this matter about how you may have handled classified material.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Are you 100 percent confident that nothing is going to come of this FBI investigation?,0,0,1,0,0,0
I am 100 percent confident.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a security review that was requested.,0,0,0,1,0,1
It is being carried out.,0,0,0,1,0,0
It will be resolved.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I have to add if there's going to be a security review about me, there's going to have to be security reviews about a lot of other people, including Republican office holders, because we've got this absurd situation of retroactive classifications.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Honest to goodness, this is -- this just beggars the imagination.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I have absolutely no concerns about it, but we've got to get to the bottom of what's really going on here, and I hope that will happen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Senator sanders, you famously at the first debate said you didn't give a darn about her emails; I think you used another (inaudible).",0,0,1,0,0,0
(OFF-MIKE),0,0,0,0,0,0
You're right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm trying to -- it's a -- it's a family hour still right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"After 11:00, I'll say it the other way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you mostly have refrained from commenting on it, but recently you called it a very serious issue, and then the other day you said well she's getting slapped with the email controversy.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Are you -- how are you feeling about these darn emails now?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am feeling exactly the way I felt at the first debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's a process under way.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I will not politicize it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way -- and by the way, if I may, the secretary probably doesn't know that there's not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue, and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, in December, one of your campaign staffers was fired from your campaign for taking voter data essentially from the Clinton campaign.",0,1,1,1,0,1
You apologized for that when the incident was made public.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Your campaign has now been criticized for its operatives essentially impersonating culinary union members wearing union pins in Nevada, and the Nashua Telegraph has complained recently that you falsely implied in an advertisement that they had endorsed you when they did not.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"None of these issues obviously is the end of the world, but they all are of a piece.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you in some sense losing control of your campaign?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not losing control of our campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we have hired a whole lot of people in a rapid way and I am familiar with the first two instances and they are unacceptable, and we have apologized and dealt with that.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"In terms of the last one, as I understand it, we did not suggest that we had the endorsement of a newspaper.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"Newspapers who make endorsements also say positive things about other candidates, and to the best of my knowledge, that is what we did.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So we never said, never said that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not.",1,1,1,1,0,1
What we did say is blah blah blah blah was said by the newspaper.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Just to follow up on that, the title of the ad in question was Endorsement.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But that was only for -- that was not to be on television.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's an important point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That was just something -- as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none, that said that those newspapers had endorsed us.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"Secretary Clinton, do you want 30 seconds on that issue?",0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And with that, we will (inaudible).",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Welcome back to the University of New Hampshire, and the Democratic candidates' debate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, on the issue of the death penalty, here in New Hampshire, the one person who is on death row is there for killing a police officer.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"It's a crime that has caused anguish in this state, both among death penalty opponents and death penalty supporters.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"The last time I had the chance to talk with you on this issue, on the death penalty, you said that capital punishment has a place in a very few federal cases, but you also said you would breathe a sigh of relief if the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty nationwide.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Tonight, do you still support capital punishment, even if you do so reluctantly?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And -- you know, what I hope the Supreme Court will do is make it absolutely clear that any state that continues capital punishment either must meet the highest standards of evidentiary (ph) proof of effective assistance of counsel or they cannot continue it because that, to me, is the real dividing line.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"I have much more confidence in the federal system, and I do reserve it for particularly heinous crimes in the federal system, like terrorism.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have strong feelings about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I thought it was appropriate after a very thorough trial that Timothy McVeigh received the death penalty for blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people, including 19 children in a daycare center.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"I do for very limited, particularly heinous crimes believe it is an appropriate punishment, but I deeply disagree with the way that too many states are still implementing it.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"If it were possible to separate the federal from the state system by the Supreme Court, that would, I think, be an appropriate outcome.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Senator Sanders, you have singled out the death penalty, and Senator Clinton's support for the death penalty, as an issue that makes it hard to consider as progressive in your mind...",0,0,0,1,0,0
"... Look, I hear what the Secretary said, and I understand, but look, there are -- all of us know that we have seen in recent years horrible, horrible crimes.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"It's hard to imagine how people can do, bomb, and kill 168 people in Oklahoma City, or do the Boston Marathon bombing, but this is what I believe, and for a couple of reasons.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"Number one, too many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty.",0,1,1,1,0,1
That's number one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to be very careful about making sure about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, second of all, and maybe, in a deeper reason, of course there are barbaric acts out there.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But, in a world of so much violence and killing, I just don't believe that government itself should be part of the killing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So, when somebody commits...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"... Somebody commits any of these terrible crimes that we have seen, you lock them up, and you toss away the key.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They're never going to get out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, I just don't' want to see government be part of killing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Another issue related to the proper role of government, and in this case, specifically the role of government between the federal government and the states.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I want to talk for a moment about the issue of Flint, Michigan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the Flint lead poisoning disaster, you have both been highly critical of Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan, and how the state in Michigan both caused the lead poisoning problem, and has not acted fast enough to fix it.",0,0,1,1,0,1
You have both been outspoken on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The fact is that Michigan though has not fixed it.,0,0,0,1,0,1
There is no door to door delivery of clean water in Flint even today.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Not a single lead pipe has been replaced in Flint, even today.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"If the state is failing, would you, Secretary Clinton, would you as President order a federal response to get it right over and above the wishes of the state?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Rachel, you and I have talked about this before.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I thank you for going to Flint to hold that town hall.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will be in Flint at the Mayor's invitation on Sunday to get an in depth briefing about what is, and is not happening.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is an emergency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Everyday that goes by that these people, particularly the children, are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a child's life.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I know from the work that I've done over so many years, lead, the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development, your body development, your behavior.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are bearing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If Michigan won't do it, there have to be ways that we can begin to move, and then make them pay for it, and hold them accountable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders are there things the President could be doing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"President Obama could be ordering, done, right now, in Flint, Michigan that are not being done that you as President would do?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I don't go around asking for governor's resignations every day.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, I think I never have in my life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility...,0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... was so outrageous.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What we are talking about are children being poisoned.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That's what we're talking about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We don't know, no one knows for sure because they haven't done the appropriate studies, but there's no question that kids' intellectual development may have been impacted.",0,0,1,0,0,1
We don't know how many thousands.,0,1,0,0,0,1
The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when you have one of the, I think, significant public health crises of recent years, of course the federal government comes in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And of course the federal government says, you're not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Last point on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I suspect the secretary agrees.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Flint, Michigan, is a poor community.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It is disproportionately African-American and minority.,0,0,1,1,0,1
And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Senator, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, let me turn to the issue of trade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In the '90s you supported NAFTA.,1,0,0,1,0,0
But you opposed it when you ran for the president in 2008.,1,0,1,1,0,0
"As secretary of state, you supported TPP, and then -- which, of course, is that trade agreement with a lot of Asian countries, but you now oppose it as you make your second bid for president.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"If elected, should Democrats expect that once you're in office you will then become supportive of these trade agreements again?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Chuck, I've only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.",1,0,0,1,0,0
Now I have a very clear view about this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to trade with the rest of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We are 5 percent of the world's population.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We have to trade with the other 95 percent.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And trade has to be reciprocal.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's the way the global economy works.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy.,0,0,0,1,0,0
So it's not just what's in the trade agreement that I'm interested in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We go the UAW on board because of changes we made.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Senator Sanders, I know you want to respond on this, you have never supported a trade deal since you've been in Congress.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Absolutely right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But if you do that as president...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you do that as president, how are you not essentially letting China, who will do all of these deals around the world, how are you going to prevent China from essentially setting the rules of trade for the world?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Chuck, I believe in trade, but I do not believe in unfettered free trade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I was not only in opposition to NAFTA -- and this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"I was not only in opposition to NAFTA, I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understood -- I don't think this is really rocket science.",0,0,1,1,0,0
We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I didn't believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, it's to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.",1,1,1,1,0,1
I don't want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"I don't want companies shutting down in America, throwing people out on the street, moving to China, and bringing their products back into this country.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"So, do I believe in trade?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course, I believe in trade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America, for corporate America, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, ""Hey, you don't want to take a cut in pay? We're going to China.""",1,1,1,1,0,1
Workers today are working longer hours for lower wages.,1,0,0,1,1,1
Trade is one of the reasons for that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you both.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to sneak in one more break here, and when we come back we'll squeeze as many questions as we can before we end this thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll be right back.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Welcome back here in the final minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The home stretch.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The home stretch of this only Democratic debate in the final week before the primary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me start with you, Secretary Clinton, on this question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obviously, President Obama got a lot of ambitious stuff done in his first year and a half.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You're going to have to make choices.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there's a lot of heavy lifts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And he made choices.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He did healthcare and it came at the expense, arguably, of immigration reform.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Had he put immigration reform first, perhaps that gets done and healthcare doesn't.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So there are three big lifts that you've talked about: immigration, gun reform, climate change.",0,0,0,1,0,0
What do you do first?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because you know the first one is the one you have the best shot at getting done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I -- I don't accept that premise, Chuck.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that we've got so much business we have to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've talked a lot tonight about what we're against -- we're against income inequality.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're against the abuses of powerful interests.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're against a lot of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm for a lot of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't want to just stop bad things from happening, I want to start good things from happening.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I believe, if I'm so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want us to keep working on the Affordable Care Act, to get not only to 100 percent coverage, but bring down the costs of prescription drugs and out-of-pocket costs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I want to move forward on paid family leave, on early childhood education, I want us to do more for small businesses.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and we're not creating and growing small businesses.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces -- because that's the way Congress is set up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure -- we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, but Senator Sanders...",0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... you've still got to do something first.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As you know, history said -- shows what you pick first is your best shot at getting, and how you prioritize things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, let...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Immigration reform, for instance, fell by the wayside in the first term because of this.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We got to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you miss -- when you looked at the issues, you missed two of the most important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is you're not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform.,0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"So long as big money interests control the United States Congress, it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families.",0,0,1,0,0,1
So let me be very clear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No nominee of mine, if I'm elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United.",0,0,1,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Second point -- second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country -- largely African-American and Latino -- the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"No, you just can't negotiate with Mitch McConnell.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, ""Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class. Start listening to working families.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as president, that's what I will work hard on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, Republicans, particularly in campaign years, often talk about which departments of government -- which agencies of government they would get rid of if they were elected president.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"The EPA, the Department of Education, the Commerce Department, oops -- is -- is there a department of government that you would get rid of?",0,0,1,0,0,1
Or is there a whole new one that you would create?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The answer to both of those is no.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm interested in making what we have work better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesn't work, and be absolutely clear we're getting rid of what doesn't work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have had the opportunity to run a big agency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better -- better than anybody had run it in a long time.,0,0,0,1,0,0
So I have an idea of what it's going to take to make our government work more efficiently.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think it's not appropriate to say ""I'm going to get rid of this, get rid of that"" until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think it's the greatest work that Americans will be called to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans here's what we're trying to get done, here's why I need your help, here's why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isn't something you care about, but I'm telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows --",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
-- it will actually raise wages.,0,1,0,0,0,0
You have to make all those connections so that you've got people with you every step of the way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what I want to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, before we go, I want to ask each one of these.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you've made it clear when you look at Senator Sanders, you do not see a president, but do you see --",0,0,0,0,0,1
I never said that.,0,1,0,1,0,0
But do you see -- do you see a vice president?,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
Look --,0,0,0,0,0,0
Would you unite the party by trying to pick Senator Sanders as your running mate?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm certainly going to unite the party, but I'm not -- I'm not getting ahead of myself.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that would be a little bit presumptuous.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I'm so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, would you consider the secretary?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with what the secretary said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We shouldn't be getting ahead of ourselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as I have said many times, you know, sometimes in these campaigns, things get a little bit out of hand.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope it's mutual.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And on our worst days, I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
That's true.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's true.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, closing statements.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You are first.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well first, thanks to MSNBC and thanks to all of you for holding this debate before the New Hampshire primary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am going to campaign as hard as I can between now and Tuesday to earn your votes in that primary, and I hear some talk that people are trying to decide do they vote with their heart, do they vote with their head, I'm asking you to bring both your heart and your head to vote with you on Tuesday because we have a lot of work that can only come because your heart is moved.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we didn't get to talk about the continuing struggles that Americans face with racism, with sexism, with discrimination against the LGBT community, with new Americans, with people with disabilities.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders' supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you we've got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Madam Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I -- my dad came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Didn't have any money, couldn't speak English, he died pretty young, and I think it would have been beyond his wildest dreams to see his son up here on this stage today running for president.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I love this country and my dad loved this country, and he was the most proud American because of what it gave him in terms of raising his family, even though we never had much money.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But today in America, we are the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people, that doesn't guarantee paid family and medical leave.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth.,1,1,0,1,0,1
We are seeing millions of families unable to send their kids to college in the United States of America.,0,1,0,1,0,1
I'm running for president because I believe it is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I do believe we need a political revolution where millions of people stand up and say loudly and clearly that our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, there you have it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I promise you, Rachel and I have a lot more questions, but we just don't have any more time, unless we could (inaudible) a third hour, but I don't think so.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our debate coverage -- (inaudible) debate coverage will continue in just a moment with our colleague (inaudible).,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we want to thank all of you for being here, and we want to thank the two candidates for taking part in this important event.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We also want to thank our host, the University of New Hampshire, and the people of New Hampshire.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You guys get to vote in just five days.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can't wait to see how it turns out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Don't screw up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll see you in a few minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Good evening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I'm Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then I'll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"By coin toss, it's been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have an enthusiastic audience tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They've agreed to only express that enthusiasm once at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Governor Mike Pence and Senator Tim Kaine.,0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentlemen, welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to start with the topic of presidential leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment's notice?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Kaine?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a very special place.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School.",0,0,0,0,0,1
She made history by protesting school segregation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She believed our nation was stronger together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why I'm so proud to be her running mate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It'll be whether we can make somebody's life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer -- it's going to be about results.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she said to me, you've been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You've been a city councilman and mayor.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You've been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people's lives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton's right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I relish that role.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm so proud of her.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'll just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor Pence?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to -- thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my -- my wonderful family.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, Senator Kaine, it's an honor to be here with you, as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I just -- I also want to say -- I want to say thanks to everyone that's looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For the last seven-and-a-half years, we've seen America's place in the world weakened.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change.",0,1,0,1,1,1
And so I want to thank all of you for being -- being with us tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have to tell you, I'm a -- I'm a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son's age.,0,0,0,0,0,1
My mom and dad built a -- everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They built a family and -- and a good name and a business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they raised a family.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I -- honestly, Elaine, I never imagined -- never imagined I'd have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So to answer your question, I would say I -- I would hope that if -- if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I'm going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I've served in the Congress of the United States, where -- where I've led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I -- I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that -- that lifetime of experience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton's character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don't think she's trustworthy.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Why do so many people distrust her?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's what people should look at as they look at a public servant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton has that passion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children's Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it's always been about putting others first.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And that's a sharp contrast with Donald Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump always puts himself first.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, ""off the backs of the little guy.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn't born in the United States.",0,1,1,1,1,1
It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I can't imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish ""me first"" style of Donald Trump.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, ""thoughtful, compassionate, and steady.""",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Yet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, let me -- let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult- driven campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It really is remarkable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"I mean, the situation we're watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"The newly emboldened -- the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now they're heavy-handed approach...",0,1,1,0,0,0
You guys love Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You both have said...,0,0,0,0,0,0
their heavy-handed approach.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You both have said -- you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Well...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we're going to get to Russia in just a moment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I do want to get back to the question at...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in the midst -- Elaine, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator, I'll...",0,0,0,0,0,0
These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader.,0,1,0,0,1,0
How can that...,0,0,1,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, and we will get to that, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We do have that coming up here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in the meantime, the questions...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Senator, I must have hit a...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
I must have hit a nerve here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why the disconnect?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we've weakened America's place in the world, stifled America's economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times.",0,0,0,0,0,1
He's brought an extraordinary business acumen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's employed tens of thousands of people in this country.,0,1,0,1,0,1
And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year.,0,1,0,1,0,1
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
And why the disconnect with your running mate?,0,0,0,0,0,0
But there's a -- there's a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And that's because they're paying attention.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on.",0,0,0,0,0,1
She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments.,0,1,0,1,1,1
You are Donald Trump's apprentice.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Do you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me tell you this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?",0,0,0,0,0,1
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan?",0,0,0,1,0,1
Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?,0,1,1,1,0,1
"Under Secretary Clinton's leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth.",0,0,0,1,0,1
She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile.,1,1,1,1,0,1
She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.,1,1,1,1,0,1
Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Absolutely, without firing a shot.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000.",0,1,0,1,0,1
Right and...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"These are very, very good things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate...",0,1,1,1,1,1
"Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton -- Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement...,0,1,1,1,0,0

and overrun vast areas of Iraq.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011.",1,0,0,1,0,1
"And, Elaine, Iraq didn't want our troops to stay, and they wouldn't give us the protection for our troops.",1,1,1,1,0,1
And guess what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we're not going to stay without their protection.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that's...",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Let's turn to the issue of the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"In fact, your plans would add even more to it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Governor Pence?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think the fact that -- that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"I mean, I'm very proud of the fact that -- I come from a state that works.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The state of Indiana has balanced budgets.,1,0,0,1,0,1
"We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank.",1,1,0,1,0,1
That's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia.,0,0,0,0,0,1
He actually -- he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion.,0,1,1,1,1,1
He left his state about $2 billion in the hole.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"But I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that.",0,1,1,1,0,1
You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan.",0,1,1,1,0,1
But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They want to expand it into a single-payer program.,0,1,0,1,1,1
"And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy.",0,1,0,1,0,1
We can get America moving again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Senator Kaine?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Elaine, on the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do you want a ""you're hired"" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a ""you're fired"" president in Donald Trump?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that's not such a hard choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary and I have a plan that's on the table that's a ""you're hired"" plan.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Five components.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The Trump plan is a different plan.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"It's a ""you're fired"" plan.",0,1,0,0,0,0
And there's two key elements to it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, Donald Trump said wages are too high.",1,1,1,1,1,1
And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.,0,1,0,1,1,1
"Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.",0,1,0,1,0,1
And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs.,1,1,1,1,0,1
The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs.,1,1,0,1,0,1
And Donald Trump -- why would he do this?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Because his tax plan basically helps him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump's 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Does that seem fair to you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the ""you're hired,"" ""you're fired"" thing, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You use that a whole lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, what -- what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"And if you think that's all working, then you look at the other side of the table.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch.",0,1,1,1,1,1
We're in the...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fifteen million new jobs?,1,1,0,0,1,0
slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.,0,1,0,1,0,1
Fifteen million new jobs?,1,1,0,0,1,0
Governor...,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side...,0,1,0,1,0,1
And the poverty level and the median income...,0,0,0,0,0,0
stepped into the Oval Office.,0,1,0,0,0,0
improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015.,0,1,0,1,0,1

"People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, this economy is struggling.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The answer to this economy is not more taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it's not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not more spending...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
I am interested to hear whether he'll defend his running mate's not releasing taxes and not paying taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely I will.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine -- God bless you for it, career public servants, that's great -- Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He actually built a business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Those tax returns that were -- that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what's called net operating loss.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But why won't he release his tax returns?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we're answering the question about -- about a business thing, is he...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do want to come back to that, but...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"His tax returns -- his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used.",0,1,0,0,0,1
And he did it brilliantly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How do you know that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You haven't seen his tax returns.,0,0,0,0,0,1
He created a runway -- because he's created a business that's worth billions of dollars today.,0,1,0,1,0,1
How do you know that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn't pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And he's paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes...",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Elaine, let me talk about something.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, I'm going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The only issue on taxes -- Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, ""If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes.""",0,1,0,1,0,1
He's broken his first...,0,0,0,0,0,0

He's broken his first promise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Second, he stood on the stage...",0,0,0,0,0,0
He hasn't broken his promise.,0,1,0,0,0,0
He said he's...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven't been paying taxes, he said, ""That makes me smart.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
So it's smart not to pay for our military?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's smart not to pay for veterans?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's smart not to pay for teachers?,0,0,0,0,0,0

And the last thing I'll say is this...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, do you take all the deductions that you're entitled to?",0,0,0,0,0,0
The last thing -- the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president.,0,1,0,0,0,1
Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he's qualified to be president.,0,1,0,0,0,1
And he's breaking his promise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Elaine, I have to respond to this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You get very little time, 20 seconds.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll be -- I'll be very respectful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires.",0,1,1,1,0,1
But he said he would release his tax returns.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"All right, Gentlemen...",0,0,0,0,0,0
The American people can review that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And he's going -- Senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over...",0,0,0,0,0,0
I need to ask you about Social Security...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.,1,1,0,1,1,1
They're going to raise your taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to cut your taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Gentlemen...,0,0,0,0,0,0
If you can't meet Nixon's standard...,0,0,0,0,0,0
The people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're having fun up here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Kaine, on the issue of Social Security, in 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you'll be 76.",0,1,0,1,0,1

"It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We have to keep it solvent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we will keep it solvent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we'll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's what Hillary and I will not do.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And I want to make this very plain.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security.",0,1,1,0,0,0
Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.,0,1,1,1,1,1
"And when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it.",0,1,0,1,0,1

"Elaine, I think that's a very fair comment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we put a lot on police shoulders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"And then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we did something we had really wanted to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Here's what I learned as a mayor and a governor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don't work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country.,0,0,0,1,0,0
That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So here's what we'll do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll focus on community policing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We will focus on -- and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States.",0,0,0,1,0,1

I'm a strong Second Amendment supporter.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks.",0,1,1,1,0,1

I just think...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can I -- can I explain...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals.,0,1,1,1,0,0

Ours is an insult-driven campaign?,0,0,1,0,0,0

Immigration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's two plans on the table.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump believes in deportation nation.,0,0,1,1,0,1
You've got to pick your choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's our proposal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's another 4.5 million people.,0,0,0,1,0,1
These guys -- and Donald Trump have said it -- deportation force.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people.",0,1,0,0,0,0
And I cannot believe...,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's nonsense.,0,1,0,0,0,0
That's nonsense.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate's claim that we should create a deportation force to -- so that they'll all be gone.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Senator, we have a deportation force.",0,1,1,1,0,0
It's called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States of America.,0,1,0,1,0,1
So you like the 16 million deportations?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Senator, that's -- that's nonsense.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Look, what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders, amnesty.",1,1,0,1,0,1
That's...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Our plan is like Ronald Reagan's plan from 1986.,0,1,0,1,0,1
They call it comprehensive immigration reform -- they call it comprehensive immigration reform on Capitol Hill.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We all know the routine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's amnesty.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That's how Washington always plays it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They always say we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we'll eventually get the border...",0,0,0,0,0,0

"border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Governor, Mr. Trump has said...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So, Governor, how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Would they be forcibly removed?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think Donald Trump laid out a series of priorities that doesn't ends with border security.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It begins with border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And after we secure the border, not only build a wall, but beneath the ground and in the air, we do internal enforcement.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens.,0,0,1,1,0,0
We just -- we just had a conversation about law enforcement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We just had a conversation about the -- the violence that's besetting our cities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The reality is that there's heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity.,0,1,1,1,0,1
And we don't have the resources or the will to deport them systemically.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"Donald Trump has said we're going to move those people out, people who've overstayed their visas.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We're going to enforce the law of this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we've done all of those things, that we're going to reform the immigration system that we have...",0,0,0,1,0,1
I just have to correct Governor Pence....,0,0,0,0,0,0
where people can come into this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the order that you should do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Border security, removing criminal aliens, upholding with law, and then -- but then, Senator, I'll work you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you, we'll work you to reform the immigration system.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I just want to make it very, very clear that he's trying to fuzz up what Donald Trump has said.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said, no, we're building a wall, and we're deporting everybody.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"He said, quote, ""They will all be gone.""",0,1,0,0,0,0
They will all be gone.,0,1,0,0,0,0
And this is one of these ones where you can just go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And to add...,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's talking about criminal aliens.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And to add to it, and to add to it, and to add to it, we are a nation of immigrants.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mike Pence and I both are descended from immigrant families.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Some things, you know, maybe weren't said so great about the Irish when they came, but we've done well by absorbing immigrants, and it's made our nation stronger.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"When Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists and criminals, Mexican immigrants, when Donald Trump says about your judge, a Hoosier judge, he said that Judge Curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were Mexican, I can't imagine how you could defend that.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Gentleman, I'd like to shift now to the threat of terrorism.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Has the terrorist threat increased or decreased?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Senator Kaine?,0,0,0,0,0,0

The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped.,0,0,1,1,0,1

And she's got a plan to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden.,0,1,1,1,0,0
Here's her plan to defeat ISIL.,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's the Hillary Clinton plan; she's got the experience to do it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Donald Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump can't start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.,0,1,1,0,0,0

He doesn't have a plan.,0,1,0,0,0,0

Here's four.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He trash talks the military.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"The military is a disaster, John McCain's no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them.",0,1,1,0,1,1
He wants to tear up alliances.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"NATO is obsolete, and we'll only work together with Israel if they pay ""big league.""",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Third, he loves dictators.",0,0,0,0,0,0

We are back at war in Iraq.,0,0,0,1,0,0

That's not -- that's absolutely false.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"That's what the Seventh Circuit decided just -- here's the difference, Elaine.",0,0,0,1,0,0

Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can we just be clear -- Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we'll vet refugees based on whether they're dangerous or not.,0,0,1,0,0,1
We won't do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.,0,0,0,0,0,0
has talked about an intelligence surge.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What exactly would an intelligence surge look like?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Intelligence surge is two-thirds, Elaine.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It's two things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we've got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"So it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the second piece of this is really, really important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Alliances are critical.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why Donald Trump's claim that he wants to -- that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.,1,0,1,0,0,1
That's not his plan.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"Well, he said NATO is obsolete.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And, look, if you put aside -- push aside your alliances, who you're going to share intelligence with?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She built the sanctions regime around the word that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program.,0,1,1,1,0,1
And that's what an intelligence surge means.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'd like to turn now to the tragedy in Syria.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0

It begins by rebuilding our military.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Donald Trump's idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s.,0,0,1,0,0,1
He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event.,0,0,1,0,0,1

Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won.,0,0,0,1,0,1

"Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can't imagine how you can defend your running mate's position on one issue after the next.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in all six cases, he's refused to defend his running mate.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"Well, let's -- no, no, don't put words in my mouth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's going...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And I just think that should be underlined.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I'm -- look...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, gentlemen, let's talk about Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a topic that has come up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm very, very happy to defend Donald Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If he wants to take these one at a time, I'll take them one at a time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will give you an opportunity to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
More nations should get nuclear weapons.,0,1,0,0,1,1
Try to defend that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Don't put words in my mouth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, he never said that, Senator.",0,1,1,1,1,0
He absolutely said it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Most of the stuffy you've said, he's never said.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Gentlemen, Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and has provided crucial military support to the Assad regime.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"What steps, if any, would your administration take to counter these actions?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Kaine?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've got to be tough on Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So let's start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he's a great leader.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And Donald Trump has business...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, we haven't.",0,0,0,1,0,0
has business dealings -- has business dealings with Russia that he refuses to disclose.,0,0,1,1,0,1
Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to- toe with Russia.,0,1,0,1,0,0
She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile.,0,1,0,1,0,1
She's had the experience doing it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"And we've done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we've put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Donald Trump, on the other hand, didn't know that Russia had invaded the Crimea.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Oh, that's nonsense.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He was on a TV show a couple months back, and he said, ""I'll guarantee you this, Russia's not going into the Ukraine.""",0,0,1,0,0,1
And he had to be reminded that they had gone into the Crimea two years before.,0,0,0,1,0,1
He knew that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia to work out a deal on New START.,0,1,0,1,0,1
She got them engaged on a meaningful way to cap Iran's nuclear weapons program.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And yet she stood up to them on issues such as Syria and their invasion of Georgia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You've got to have the ability to do that, and Hillary does.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the other hand, in Donald Trump, you have somebody who praises Vladimir Putin all the time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"America should really wonder about a President Trump, who had a campaign manager with ties to Putin, pro- Putin elements in the Ukraine, who had to be fired for that reason.",0,1,1,1,0,0
"They should wonder -- when Donald Trump is sitting down with Vladimir Putin, is it going to be America's bottom line or is it going to be Donald Trump's bottom line that he's going to be worried about with all of his business dealings?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, this could be solved if Donald Trump would be willing to release his tax returns, as he told the American public that he would do.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I know he's laughing at this, but every president...",0,0,0,0,0,0
But what's it got to do with Russia?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Every president since Richard Nixon has done it, and Donald Trump has said I'm doing business with Russia.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The only way the American public will see whether he has a conflict of interest...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, he hasn't said that.",0,1,1,1,0,0
"He has, actually.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, your time is up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, thanks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm just trying to keep up with the insult-driven campaign on the other side of the table.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I'm just saying facts about your running mate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I know you can't defend.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the governor's two minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm happy to defend him, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Don't put words in my mouth that I'm not defending him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm happy to defend him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Most of what you said is completely false, and the American people know that.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I'll run through the list of things where you won't defend...,0,0,0,0,0,0
This isn't the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is Governor Pence's two minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, this is the alternative universe of Washington, D.C., versus reality.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Hillary Clinton said her number-one priority was a reset with Russia.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"That reset resulted in the invasion of Ukraine, after they'd infiltrated with what are called little green men, Russian soldiers that were dressing up like Ukrainian dissidents, and then they moved all the way into Crimea, took over the Crimean Peninsula.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Donald Trump knew that happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He basically was saying it's not going to happen again.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had -- increased its influence in Iran, that's now -- now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear -- the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that -- Syria is imploding.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo.,0,0,0,0,0,0
ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"It is -- ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier -- I get all that -- in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day...",0,0,0,0,0,0
We even wiped out the leader of Al Qaida.,0,1,0,1,0,0
on the day that Iran released four American hostages...,0,1,1,1,0,1
We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons.,0,1,1,1,0,0
Governor...,0,0,0,0,0,0
we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.,0,1,1,1,1,1
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, yesterday, Mr. Trump said...",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot.,0,1,1,1,0,0
"quote, ""Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton and no respect for Obama.""",0,1,1,0,0,0
Why do you think he'll respect a Trump- Pence administration?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Strength.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Plain and simple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Business dealings.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump -- that's nonsense.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Donald Trump is a strong leader...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump's son says that the Trump organization...,0,0,1,0,0,0
who is going to lead with American strength.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Please, Senator, I'll give you a chance to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to rebuild our military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And let me -- let me -- this whole Putin thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, America is stronger than Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Our economy is 16 times larger than the Russian economy.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"America's political system is superior to the crony, corrupt capitalist system in Russia in every way.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts.",0,1,1,1,0,1
That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Kaine?,0,0,0,0,0,0
of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.",1,1,0,1,0,1
That is absolutely inaccurate.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And -- and -- and I just think a guy who praises...,0,0,0,0,0,0
He said he's stronger -- he's been stronger on the world stage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, he said leader.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And if -- and I'll just say this, Governor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You just said better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you mistake leadership for dictatorship, and you can't tell the difference, a country that's running its economy into the ground...",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Yeah, here we go.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the grade school thing again?,0,0,0,0,0,0
persecuting journalists...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right, this is grade school.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"if you can't tell the difference, you shouldn't be commander-in-chief.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And with Donald Trump -- Donald Trump's sons say that they have all these business dealings with Russia.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Those could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America's bottom line or his own bottom line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Kaine, what went wrong with the Russia reset?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Vladimir Putin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Vladimir Putin is a dictator.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And what would do you differently?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Vladimir Putin is a dictator.,0,0,0,0,0,1
He's not a leader.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Anybody who thinks otherwise doesn't know Russian history and they don't know Vladimir Putin.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton knows exactly who this guy is.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"John McCain said, I look in his eyes and I see KGB.",0,1,0,0,0,1
And Hillary kind of has that same feeling.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So how do deal with him?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've got to -- we do have to deal with Russia in a lot of different ways.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are areas where we can cooperate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So it was Hillary Clinton who worked with Russia on the New START Treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile.,0,1,1,1,0,1
It was Hillary Clinton that worked with Russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons without firing a shot.,0,0,1,1,0,1
She's not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a very challenging part of the world, and we ought to have a commander-in-chief who is prepared and done it, rather than somebody who goes around praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, I'd like to ask now about North Korea, Iran and the threat of nuclear weapons.",0,0,1,0,0,0
North Korea recently conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test.,0,1,0,1,0,1
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What specific steps would you take to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Governor Pence?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first, we need to -- we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military, including modernizing our nuclear forces.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we also need -- we also need an effective American diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the Asian Pacific Rim to put pressure on North Korea, on Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"It has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we're -- we're not going to have the -- the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power.",0,0,1,1,0,1
We're going to -- we're going to go back to the days of peace through strength.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I have to tell you that -- that all this talk about tax returns -- and I get it, you know, you want to keep bringing that up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It must have -- must have...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Until he...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
done well in some focus group.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But here -- Hillary Clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the Clinton Foundation.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"While she was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Now, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process.",0,0,1,0,0,1
They cannot make financial contributions.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"When you talk about all these -- all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton -- you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning -- the reason...",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Governor, your two minutes are up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
the reason the American people don't trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server...,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Governor, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
while she's secretary of state.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your two minutes are up, Governor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they're saying enough is enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Kaine?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to talk about the foundation, and then I'll talk about North Korea.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, on the foundation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I am glad to talk about the foundation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world.,0,0,0,1,0,1
It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people.,0,0,0,1,1,1
It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does.,0,1,0,1,0,1
The Clinton foundation does an awful lot of good work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States.",0,0,1,1,0,1
So the foundation does good work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But let's compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns.,0,1,1,0,0,1
He's refused to do it.,0,0,1,1,0,0
His sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"It's putting money into Donald Trump's pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary.",0,0,1,1,0,1
The Trump Foundation is non-profit.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"In addition, Donald Trump has a foundation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University.,0,1,1,1,0,1
This is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won't share with the American public what he's doing and what those conflicts are.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Governor, I will give you 30 seconds to respond, because I know you want to, but, again, I would remind you both this was about North Korea.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Trump Foundation is a private family foundation.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Political contributions?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Less than ten cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"A $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump?",0,0,0,0,1,0
Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.,1,1,0,1,0,1
Ninety percent.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"It has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But honestly, Senator, we would know a lot more about it if Hillary Clinton would just turn over the 33,000 e-mails...",1,0,1,0,0,0
"All right, let's turn back to North Korea...",0,0,0,0,0,0
that she refused to turn over in her private server...,0,0,1,1,0,0
Senator Kaine...,0,0,0,0,0,0
and we'd have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Kaine, if you had intelligence that North Korea was about to launch a missile, a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States, would you take preemptive action?",0,0,1,0,0,1
"If we -- look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have to.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A president has to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this -- virtually the same package.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"They're starting to get worried about North Korea, too.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"So we're working together with China, and we need to.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"China's another one of those relationships where it's competitive, it's also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Hillary understands that very well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, ""Women's rights are human rights.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They didn't want her to say that, but she did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But she's also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And that's what it's going to take.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China.",0,1,1,1,0,1
I'm not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to turn to our next segment now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in this, I'd like to focus on social issues.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Kaine?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, that's an easy one for me, Elaine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's an easy one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm really fortunate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My mom and dad are sitting right here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My 40th reunion is in 10 days.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And so I had to grapple with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you elect me, I will uphold the law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I was elected, and I did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn't feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That was a real struggle.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don't feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor Pence?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it's a wonderful question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I've tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And with my wife at my side, we've followed a calling into public service, where we've -- we've tried to -- we've tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and -- and -- and -- I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine's sincere faith.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I truly do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's shared.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I'm also very pleased at the fact we're well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"I think if you're going to be pro-life, you should -- you should be pro- adoption.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion.,1,0,0,1,0,0
"I mean, to hold to the view -- and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally -- but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I cannot -- I can't conscience about -- about a party that supports that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Or that -- I know you've historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion.,0,0,1,1,0,1
But Hillary Clinton wants to -- wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn't use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"So for me, my faith informs my life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I try and spend a little time on my knees every day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So let's talk about abortion and choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's talk about them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We support Roe v. Wade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's something we trust American women to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we don't think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.",0,1,0,1,0,1
Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade.,0,1,1,1,0,1
He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history.,0,1,0,0,0,0
And we have some young people in the audience who weren't even born when Roe was decided.,0,0,0,0,0,1
This is pretty important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.",0,1,1,1,0,1
I think you should live your moral values.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.,0,1,1,0,1,0
"No, it's really not.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Then why did Donald Trump say that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We just never would.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why did he say that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, look, it's -- look, he's not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And so...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I would admit that's not a polished...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, things don't always come out exactly the way he means them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, can I say...",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm telling you what the policy of our administration would be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Great line from the -- great line from the gospel of Matthew.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals...,0,0,1,1,0,0
I'm telling you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, you've whipped out that Mexican thing again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He -- look...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you defend it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives.",0,0,1,1,0,1
You want to -- you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
He also said and many of them are good people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You keep leaving that out of your quote.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you want me to go there, I'll go there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But here's -- there is a choice, and it is a choice on life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I couldn't be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who's standing for the right to life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's a principle that -- Senator Kaine -- and I'm very gentle about this, because I really do respect you -- it's a principle that you embrace.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I have appreciated the fact that you've supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that's not Hillary Clinton's view.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"People need to understand, we can come together as a nation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We can create a culture of life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are -- we're better for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can -- like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast...,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is important --,0,0,0,0,0,0
bring the -- let's welcome the children into our world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are so many families around the country who can't have children.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We could improve adoption...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, Governor...",0,0,0,0,0,0
so that families that can't have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, why don't you trust women to make this choice for themselves?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We can encourage people to support life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course we can.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But why don't you trust women?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why doesn't Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what we ought to be doing in public life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because there are...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"but on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because there is -- a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I believe it with all my heart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I couldn't be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do have one final question for you both tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It has been a divisive campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Kaine, if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you?",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's a really important one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"And again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump -- and this is -- this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he can't defend Donald Trump -- Donald Trump has run a campaign that's been about one insult after the next.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But we do have to bring the country together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So here's what we'll do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I served in the Senate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'm really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She was on the Armed Services Committee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She was on other committees.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana.",0,1,0,1,1,1
She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"She worked to get benefits for -- TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard.",0,0,0,1,0,1
She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I think it's fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, how will you unify the country if you win?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Weakened America's place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it's going to take leadership to do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They want to see an American comeback.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And Donald Trump's entire career has been about building.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It's been about -- it's going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and -- when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we're going to have a stronger America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They're going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we'll have the kind of unity that's been missing for way too long.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, gentlemen, thank you so much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This concludes the vice presidential debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My thanks to the candidates, the commission, and to you for watching.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Please tune in this Sunday for the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis and the final debate on October 19th at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"From Farmville, Virginia, I'm Elaine Quijano of CBS News.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Good night.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much for being here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you'll go first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our first question comes from Patrice Brock.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Patrice?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, and good evening.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students' homework, do you feel you're modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today's youth?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you a teacher?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I actually agree with that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with everything she said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This is a great country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a great land.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And my whole concept was to make America great again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"In other words, trading with other countries.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We had an $800 billion deficit.,1,1,1,1,1,1
It's hard to believe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Inconceivable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You say who's making these deals?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going the make great deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have a strong border.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to bring back law and order.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And this is happening on a weekly basis.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need justice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's called make America great again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today's youth?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You called what you said locker room banter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals.",0,0,1,0,0,0
That is sexual assault.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women.,0,0,1,1,0,0
Do you understand that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I didn't say that at all.",0,1,0,0,0,0
I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm not proud of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I apologize to my family.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I apologize to the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Certainly I'm not proud of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But this is locker room talk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they look and they see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?",0,0,1,0,0,0
And they look at our country and they see what's going on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I hate it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will knock the hell out of ISIS.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We're going to defeat ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, Mr. Trump...",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?",0,0,1,0,0,0
I have great respect for women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody has more respect for women than I do.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"So, for the record, you're saying you never did that?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I was embarrassed by it.,0,1,0,0,0,0
But I have tremendous respect for women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Have you ever done those things?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And women have respect for me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will tell you: No, I have not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We're going to make America safe again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Thank you, Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's what I want to talk about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump is different.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have seen him insult women.,0,1,0,0,1,0
"We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.",0,1,0,1,0,1
We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.",0,1,0,1,1,1
So this is who Donald Trump is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we want to get to some questions from online...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Am I allowed to respond to that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I assume I am.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, you can respond to that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's just words, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's just words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to help the African-Americans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.",0,0,0,0,0,0

She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.,0,0,0,1,0,1
She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump -- I want to get to audience questions and online questions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?",0,0,1,0,0,0
You're going to have -- you're going to get to respond right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sounds fair.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This tape is generating intense interest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In just 48 hours, it's become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, ""Trump says the campaign has changed him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When did that happen?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you have two minutes for this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was locker room talk, as I told you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That was locker room talk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not proud of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And certainly, I'm not proud of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that was something that happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Mine are words, and his was action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
His was what he's done to women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.",1,1,1,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.,0,1,1,1,0,0
Four of them here tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.",1,1,0,0,0,1
"Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.",1,0,0,1,1,0
"Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So don't tell me about words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it is things that people say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.",0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Can we please hold the applause?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.",0,1,0,1,0,1
And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.,0,1,1,1,0,0
"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican.""",0,1,0,1,0,1
He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.,0,1,1,1,0,0
And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.",1,1,0,0,1,1
So you really owe him an apology.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.",0,1,0,1,0,0
"That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Number two, Michelle Obama.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, you talk about friend?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.",0,1,1,1,0,0
And I'll tell you what.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?",0,0,1,0,0,0
People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.,0,1,1,1,0,1
And it's a disgrace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to let you talk about e-mails.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"Oh, really?",0,0,0,0,0,0
In the first debate...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And really, the audience needs to calm down here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Because you'd be in jail.,0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please do not applaud.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're just wasting time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You've said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, ""extremely careless.""",0,0,1,1,0,0
"The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails.",0,1,1,1,0,1
You don't call that extremely careless?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not making any excuses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was a mistake.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And I am very sorry about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all -- anyone who says otherwise has no basis -- that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.",1,1,1,1,0,1
I take classified materials very seriously and always have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden.",0,0,0,1,0,0
So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"OK, we're going to move on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.,0,1,1,0,0,1
Right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, it's amazing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm watching Hillary go over facts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.",0,1,0,1,0,0
"Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That wasn't before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was after.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She got it from the United States Congress.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.",0,0,1,0,0,0
What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We have to move on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You did that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait a minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One second.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We want to give the audience a chance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Secretary Clinton, you can respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Then we have to move on to an audience question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, it's just not true.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And so please, go to...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, you didn't delete them?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Allow her to respond, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was personal e-mails, not official.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Oh, 33,000?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Oh, yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What about the other 15,000?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Please allow her to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She didn't talk while you talked.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, that's true, I didn't.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because you have nothing to say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Get off this question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK, Donald.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's at least focus...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's see what happens...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Allow her to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
on some of the issues that people care about tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's get to their questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has a question about health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ken?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why aren't you bringing...,0,0,0,0,0,0
We brought up the e-mails.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, it hasn't.",0,1,0,1,0,0
It hasn't.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And it hasn't been finished at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ken Karpowicz has a question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's nice to -- one on three.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Premiums have gone up.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Deductibles have gone up.,0,0,1,1,0,1
Copays have gone up.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Prescriptions have gone up.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And the coverage has gone down.,0,0,0,1,0,0
What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If he wants to start, he can start.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, go ahead, Donald.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Premiums have gotten too high.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.",0,1,0,1,0,1
But that in and of itself was a good thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.",1,0,0,1,0,1
So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we've got to get costs down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And then we would have to start all over again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.",0,1,0,1,1,1
That's the highest we've ever been in our country.,0,1,0,1,1,0
"Secretary Clinton, your time is up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Obamacare is a disaster.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You know it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We all know it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.,0,0,1,1,0,1
Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.,0,1,0,1,0,0
It's only getting worse.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In '17, it implodes by itself.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.",0,0,1,1,0,0
We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.,0,1,1,1,0,1
Obamacare will never work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's very bad, very bad health insurance.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Far too expensive.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.",0,1,0,0,0,0
It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.",0,1,1,1,0,1
We want competition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You will have the finest health care plan there is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.",0,1,0,1,0,1
It's catastrophic in certain ways.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.",0,1,0,1,0,1
Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Obamacare was the first step.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Obamacare is a total disaster.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Mr. Trump, your time...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your husband called Obamacare, quote, ""the craziest thing in the world,"" saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's very clear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But we have an employer-based system.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...",0,0,0,1,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Your time is up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not going to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I just want -- just one thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Everything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.",0,0,1,0,0,0
You've said you want to end Obamacare...,0,0,0,1,0,0

"Mr. Trump, you're first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I want to say just a couple of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.",0,0,0,1,0,1

That's what America is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We are not at war with Islam.,0,0,0,1,0,0

We have no choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have no choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Iraq was disaster.,0,1,1,0,0,0
So he would have been alive today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.,0,0,1,1,0,1
Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.,0,1,1,0,0,0
Excuse me..,0,0,0,0,0,0

Do you still believe...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why don't you interrupt her?,0,0,0,0,0,0

I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why don't you interrupt her?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's called extreme vetting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.,0,1,1,1,1,1
"People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.",0,1,0,1,1,0
This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have enough problems in this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe in building safe zones.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.",0,1,1,1,0,0
We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees.",0,1,0,1,0,1
We know you want tougher vetting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not a perfect system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.",0,1,1,0,0,1
And we need to do our part.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.",0,0,0,1,0,0
How do you do that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.,0,0,0,0,0,1
How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And how do we expect to be able to implement those?,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.",0,1,1,1,1,1

We have it on tape.,0,1,0,1,0,0
The entire press corps has looked at it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.",0,0,0,1,0,0
That's not been debunked.,0,1,1,1,0,1

go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.,1,0,1,1,1,0
Has not been debunked.,0,1,0,1,0,0

"And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"Now, here's what I want to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.",0,1,0,1,0,0
"I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.",0,0,1,1,0,0
I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's called the Buffett rule.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to invest in hard-working families.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.",1,1,0,1,0,1
And we need to reverse that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to give you -- Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I just wanted to tell our viewers what she's referring to.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"You've said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"You have not answered, though, a simple question.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Of course I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I know many of her donors.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Her donors took massive tax write-offs.,0,1,1,1,0,1
So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.",0,1,1,1,0,1
I absolutely used it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.",0,0,1,0,0,1
So we won't make them famous.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So can you -- can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I love depreciation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, she's given it to us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I say it all the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She talks about health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't she do something about it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
She talks about taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't she do something about it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With her, it's all talk and no action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In the past...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.",0,0,1,0,0,0
She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Congratulations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Great job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary -- I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, here we go again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But that's not the point here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't you do it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't you do it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Allow her to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because I was a senator with a Republican president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, really?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will be the president and we will get it done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's exactly right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you were not an effective senator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please allow her to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She didn't interrupt you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Look, he has now said repeatedly, ""30 years this and 30 years that.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm very glad to do so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.",0,1,0,1,1,1
Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to move on to Syria.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Both of you have mentioned that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She said a lot of things that were false.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, we can -- no, Mr. Trump, we're going to go on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is about the audience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because she has been a disaster as a senator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A disaster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, we're going to move on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world's attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.",0,1,1,1,0,1
So this next question comes through social media through Facebook.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Isn't it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.,0,0,1,1,0,1
Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.,0,1,1,1,0,1
They're interested in keeping Assad in power.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've stood up to Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I did as secretary of state.,0,0,0,1,0,0
That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.,1,0,0,1,0,1
It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.,0,1,1,1,0,1
So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...",0,1,0,0,1,0
"No, I wasn't.",0,1,0,0,0,0
I was gone.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you were in contact -- excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You were...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Obama draws the line in the sand.,0,1,0,0,0,0
It was laughed at all over the world what happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.",0,1,0,0,1,1
Not good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Russia is new in terms of nuclear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are old.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We're tired.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.,0,0,0,0,1,0
A very bad thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad.",0,0,1,1,0,0
She talks in favor of the rebels.,0,0,0,1,0,0
She doesn't even know who the rebels are.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And you know what happens?,0,0,0,0,0,0
They end up being worse than the people.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Gadhafi's out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a mess.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.",1,1,1,1,1,1
I'm sure you probably have heard that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was a disaster.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We sign a peace treaty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Everyone's all excited.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.",0,1,1,1,1,1
But look at that deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Iran now and Russia are now against us.,0,0,1,1,0,0
So she wants to fight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She wants to fight for rebels.,0,0,0,1,0,0
There's only one problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't even know who the rebels are.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So what's the purpose?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And one thing I have to say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Your two minutes is up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.",0,0,1,1,0,0
Russia is killing ISIS.,0,1,1,1,0,0
And Iran is killing ISIS.,0,1,1,1,0,0
And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
If you were president...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I want to remind you what your running mate said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.",0,0,1,1,0,1
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I disagree.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You disagree with your running mate?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you have to knock out ISIS.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.",0,0,1,1,0,1
We have people that want to fight both at the same time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But Syria is no longer Syria.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I believe we have to get ISIS.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.,0,0,1,0,0,0
She had a chance to do something with Syria.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They had a chance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that was the line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And she didn't.,0,0,0,1,0,0
What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.",0,0,1,0,0,0
What do you think will happen if it falls?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that it basically has fallen.,0,1,0,0,0,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It basically has fallen.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Let me tell you something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You take a look at Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.",0,0,1,1,0,0
Why can't they do it quietly?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?",0,0,1,0,0,0
People leave.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?",0,0,1,0,0,0
How stupid is our country?,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are sometimes reasons the military does that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Psychological warfare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can't think of any.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can't think of any.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm pretty good at it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It might be to help get civilians out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have General Flynn.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.",0,1,0,1,0,1
I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We talk about it all the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?",0,0,1,0,0,0
How -- why would these people stay there?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've been reading now...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Tell me what your strategy is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They're gone.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.",0,0,0,1,0,1
All I say is this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm going to go to Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo.",0,0,1,1,0,0
You talk about diplomatic efforts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Those have failed.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Cease-fires have failed.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?,0,0,1,0,0,0
I would not use American ground forces in Syria.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I think that would be a very serious mistake.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I don't think that is a smart strategy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...",0,0,0,1,0,0
But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Everything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.",0,1,1,1,0,0
"No, he doesn't.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would go after Baghdadi.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So I think that could help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would also consider arming the Kurds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to move on...,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what's funny?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You had many answers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's really -- it's really very interesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got a question over here from James Carter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Carter?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?",0,0,0,0,0,0
That question begins for Mr. Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape.",1,0,1,0,0,0
Is that the discipline of a good leader?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, there wasn't check out a sex tape.",0,1,1,1,1,0
It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You mentioned sex tape.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?",0,0,0,0,0,0

"It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.",0,1,0,1,0,1
Everybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
African-American incomes went up 33 percent.,0,1,0,1,0,1

He stuck with me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have worked and I admire President Obama.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.,0,1,0,1,0,1
That was a terrible time for our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to move along.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nine million people lost their jobs.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"Secretary Clinton, we have to...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Five million homes were lost.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"Secretary Clinton, we're moving.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.,0,0,1,1,0,1
We are back on the right track.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're almost out of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have another...,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have the slowest growth since 1929.,0,1,0,1,0,1
We're moving to an audience question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much both of you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
We have another audience question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Good evening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you're right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is one of the most important issues in this election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Donald doesn't agree with that.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.,0,0,1,1,0,0
I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.",0,1,1,1,0,1
I think that was a dereliction of duty.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're out of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have a vacancy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that this is so important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So important to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.",0,0,1,1,0,0
What I ask is this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Pretty much self-funding money.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office.",0,1,1,1,0,1
She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?",0,1,1,0,0,0
"It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Why aren't you putting some money in?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have a lot of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.",0,0,0,1,0,0
So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm just curious.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to get on to one more question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The question was about the Supreme Court.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have -- we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ken?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Mr. Trump, two minutes?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Under absolutely siege.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.",0,1,1,0,0,1
And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.,0,0,1,1,0,1
We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we need much more than wind and solar.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you look at our miners.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.,1,1,1,1,0,0
There is a thing called clean coal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.",0,1,0,0,0,1
So good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I will bring our energy companies back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They'll be able to compete.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They'll make money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They'll pay off our national debt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.",0,1,0,0,0,0
But we are putting our energy companies out of business.,0,1,0,1,0,0
We have to bring back our workers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.",0,1,1,1,0,1
We have to guard our energy companies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to make it possible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's a disgrace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Your time is up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's an absolute disgrace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And actually -- well, that was very interesting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.",0,1,1,1,0,1
That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.",1,0,0,1,0,0
We are not dependent upon the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.,0,1,0,1,0,1
So the price of oil has been way down.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?",0,1,1,0,0,1
"We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And I think that's an important transition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to remain energy-independent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.",0,0,0,0,0,1

It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.,0,0,0,0,0,0

A judge has just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries.,0,1,1,1,0,1
Booo —,0,0,0,0,0,0
The order he blocked was a watered-version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with.,0,1,1,1,0,1
This new order was tailored to the dictates of the 9th Circuit’s — in my opinion — flawed ruling.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"This is, the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach.",0,0,1,0,0,0

Ready?,0,0,0,0,0,0
So here’s the statute — which they don’t even want to quote when they overrule it.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And it was put here for the security of our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And this goes beyond me, because there will be other Presidents, and we need this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And sometimes we need it very badly for security — security of our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump, or, as they say, ""Never Trump."" And Paul just left and he’s given us his total support.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And it’s all about unification.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’re unifying the party, and hopefully we’re going to be able to unify the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s very important to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’ve been talking about that for a long time, but it’s very, very important to me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"We have to talk about it to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control.",0,0,1,0,0,0
The level of dishonesty is out of control.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort — not all the time — and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they’re honest and fantastic.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But much of it is not — the distortion.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Another mess I inherited.,0,0,1,0,0,0

It’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve had great support from the Senate.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I’ve had great support from Congress generally.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will tell you that is my — I would be so happy if we never had to use it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don’t have the right equipment.",0,0,1,0,0,0

Depleted — it’s depleted.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It won’t be depleted for long.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think one of the reasons I’m standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to have strong law enforcement also.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we do not go abroad in the search of war.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I wasn’t supposed to get 222.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They said there’s no way to get 222; 230 is impossible.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We got 306 because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before.,0,0,0,1,1,1
So that’s the way it goes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.,1,1,0,1,1,0
"In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they’re not happy about it for whatever reason.",0,0,1,0,0,0

How do you not approve him?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He’s been a colleague, highly respected — brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it — but waiting for approval.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Everybody knew that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So these people — and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia.,0,0,1,0,0,0

I saw his statement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He said it very forcefully.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Most of the papers don’t print it because that’s not good for their stories.,0,0,1,1,0,1

I was given that information.,0,0,0,0,0,0

But it was a very substantial victory.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Do you agree with that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You’re the President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they’re in position.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"The information was provided by — who I don’t know — Sally Yates — and I was a little surprised because I said, doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"As far as the actual making the call — in fact, I’ve watched various programs and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That was very normal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So — and I do — and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, Jon.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the leaks, sir —",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Go ahead, finish off, then I’ll get you, Jon.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sorry, what will you do on the leaks?",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have said twice today —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, we’re looking at it very, very seriously.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we’re — I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Those are criminal leaks.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They’re put out by people either in agencies.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t get them approved by the Senate.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So we are looking into that very seriously.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s a criminal act.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"You know what I say — when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I was called out on Mexico, I was — honestly, I was really, really surprised.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I said, you know, it doesn’t make sense, that won’t happen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But that wasn’t that important to call, it was fine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world — the President who is a very fine man, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Same thing with Australia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, that’s terrible that it was leaked but it wasn’t that important.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But then I said, what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea?",0,0,1,0,0,0
What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information — very important, very — I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?",0,0,1,0,0,0
So I don’t want classified information getting out to the public.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And in a way, that was almost a test.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I’m dealing with Mexico.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m dealing with Argentina.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And I’m saying, what’s going to happen when I’m dealing on the Middle East?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What’s going to happen when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ve got to stop it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s why it’s a criminal penalty.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Yes, Jon.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And, on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, the leaks are real.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I mean, the leaks are real.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what they said — you saw it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the leaks are absolutely real.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"So one thing that I felt it was very important to do — and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for — well, maybe a little bit — than reporters, than good reporters.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It’s very important to me, and especially in this position.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s very important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t mind bad stories.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And over a course of time, I’ll make mistakes and you’ll write badly and I’m okay with that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I’m not okay when it is fake.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, I watch CNN — it’s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t watch it anymore because it’s very good — he’s saying no.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It’s okay, Jim.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It’s okay, Jim.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You’ll have your chance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I watch others too.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You’re not the only one, so don’t feel badly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think it should be straight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it should be — I think it would be, frankly, more interesting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now, but I think that actually would be — I think that it would actually be better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"People — I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress.",1,0,1,1,1,1
I think that’s right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don’t know, Peter, is that one right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because you know, I think they have lower — I heard, lower than Congress.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"But honestly, the public would appreciate it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’d appreciate it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think we’re setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"I mean, the numbers are crazy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
When I’m looking — some of them had them approved immediately.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I’m going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there, and they have nothing going.",0,0,1,0,0,0
The only thing they can do is delay.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And you know, I think they’d be better served by approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody is good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And sometimes, I mean — I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that’s okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s fine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is pure delay tactics.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And they say it, and everybody understands it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, go ahead, Jim.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The first part of my question on contacts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you definitively say that nobody —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I had nothing to do with it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I have nothing to do with Russia.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I told you, I have no deals there.",0,1,0,1,0,0
I have no anything.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give — they’re not giving classified information.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"They’re giving stuff — what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates — which, by the way, nobody mentions.",1,0,1,0,0,0
Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.,1,0,1,1,0,1
"Can you imagine — seriously, can you imagine if I received the questions?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It would be the electric chair, okay?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He should be put in the electric chair. You would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Maybe not you, Jon.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, we’ll do you next, Jim.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ll do you next.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I just want to clarify one other thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss the sanctions with the Russian ambassador?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I didn’t.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"No, I didn’t.",0,1,0,0,0,0
(Inaudible.),0,0,0,0,0,0
(Off mic.),0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I didn’t.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Did you fire him because (inaudible),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Excuse me — no, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Mike was doing his job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He was calling countries and his counterparts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I didn’t direct him but I would have directed him because that’s his job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it came out that way — and, in all fairness, I watched Dr.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And I agreed with him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And since then I’ve watched many other people say that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it, okay?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Jim.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, thank you very much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And just for the record, we don’t hate you, I don’t hate you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
If you could pass that along.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, not too many.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We do have other people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You do have other people, and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They’re pretty good right now, actually.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Go ahead, Jim.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle.",0,0,1,1,0,1
You welcomed that at one point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was okay with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You said you loved WikiLeaks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 emails.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"I’m wondering, sir, if you —",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, she was actually missing 33,000, and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but that’s okay.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Maybe my numbers are off a little bit too.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, but I did say 30,000, but it was actually higher than that.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"If I may ask you, sir, it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, fair question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ready?,0,0,0,0,0,0
So if I may ask you that — if I may ask a follow-up —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, but are you — let me do one at a time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you mind?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So in one case you’re talking about highly classified information.,0,0,1,0,0,0
In the other case you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.",0,1,1,0,0,0
He said terrible things about her.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it wasn’t classified information.,0,0,1,1,0,1
But in one case you’re talking about classified.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong — at my suggestion — and I give Reince great credit for this — at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t want to be hacked.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And we did that, and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed.",0,0,1,1,1,0
The DNC did not do that.,0,1,1,1,0,0
"And if they did it, they could not have been hacked.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But they were hacked, and terrible things came.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so — they were — when I heard some of those things, I said — I picked up the papers the next morning, I said, oh, this is going to front page.",0,1,1,0,0,0
It wasn’t even in the papers.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would have been the headline in every newspaper.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, think of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They gave her the questions for the debate, and she should have reported herself.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why didn’t Hillary Clinton announce that, ""I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job""?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about — you said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I guess I don’t understand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It seems that there is a disconnect there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, the reporting is fake.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Look, look —",0,0,0,0,0,0
And if I may ask — I just want to ask one other question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jim, you know what it is?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Here’s the thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The public isn’t — they read newspapers, they see television, they watch.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They don’t know if it’s true or false because they’re not involved.,0,0,1,1,0,1
I’m involved.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I’m involved.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I know when you’re telling the truth or when you’re not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I just see many, many untruthful things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I tell you what else I see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I see tone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know the word ""tone.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
The tone is such hatred.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m really not a bad person, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, but the tone is such — I do get good ratings, you have to admit that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The tone is such hatred.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I watched this morning a couple of the networks, and I have to say ""Fox & Friends"" in the morning, they’re very honorable people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They’re very — not because they’re good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they have the most honest morning show.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s all I can say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s the most honest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the tone, Jim.",0,0,0,0,0,0
If you look — the hatred.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, sometimes — sometimes somebody gets —",0,0,0,0,0,0
(Off mic.),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You just take a look at that show.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is a constant hit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump.,0,0,1,1,0,0
The good news is he doesn’t have good ratings.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth, the hatred coming from other people on your network.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, I will say this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I watch it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I see it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m amazed by it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I just think you’d be a lot better off — I honestly do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The public gets it, you know.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN.",0,1,0,0,0,0
They want to throw their placards at CNN.,0,1,1,0,0,0
I think you would do much better by being different.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you just take a look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s brutal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, they’ll take this news conference.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m actually having a very good time, okay?",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they’ll take this news conference — don’t forget that’s the way I won.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(Off mic.),0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, that’s how I won.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I won with news conferences and probably speeches.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I certainly didn’t win by people listening to you people, that’s for sure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I am having a good time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m not ranting and raving.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m just telling you, you’re dishonest people.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But — but I’m not ranting and raving.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I love this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m having a good time doing it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But tomorrow the headlines are going to be: Donald Trump Rants and Raves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m not ranting and raving.,0,0,0,0,0,0
If I may just —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One more follow-up because —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Should I let him have a little bit more?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What do you think, Peter?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Just because of this —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Peter, should I have let him have a little bit more?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Sit down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sit down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just because of the attack —,0,0,1,0,0,0
We’ll get it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir —",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I’m changing it from fake news, though.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Doesn’t that undermine —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Very fake news now.,0,0,1,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
But aren’t you —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Real news, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Real news.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you’re not related to our new —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am not related, sir, no.",0,1,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I looked — you know, I looked at that name.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Alex Acosta.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m sure you checked that out, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I checked it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said — they said, no, sir.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people’s faith in the First Amendment freedom of the press, the press in this country when you call stories you don’t like ""fake news""?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Why not just say it’s a story I don’t like?,0,0,1,0,0,0
I do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you call it fake news, you’re undermining confidence —",0,0,1,0,0,0
"No, I do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, I do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
— in our news media.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here’s the thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Isn’t that important?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, I understand — and you’re right about that except this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And sometimes I’ll say, wow, that’s going to be a great story, and I’ll get killed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know what’s good and bad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’d be a pretty good reporter — not as good as you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I know what’s good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know what’s bad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And when they change it and make it really bad — something that should be positive.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make okay.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They’ll even make it negative.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So I understand it because I’m there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know what was said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know who is saying it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So it’s very important to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I want to see an honest press.",0,0,0,0,0,0
When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The press — the public doesn’t believe you people anymore.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don’t know.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they don’t believe you.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Of course, he had some questions also.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster, I would be your biggest fan in the world — including bad stories about me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if you go — as an example, you’re CNN — I mean, it’s story after story after story is bad.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I won.,0,1,0,1,0,0
I won.,0,1,0,1,0,0
And the other thing: Chaos.,0,0,1,0,0,0
There’s zero chaos.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are running — this is a fine-tuned machine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And Reince happens to be doing a good job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But half of his job is putting out lies by the press.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"I said to him yesterday, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don’t talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks.",0,0,1,1,0,0
But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I’m saying, here’s my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, we won the election, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We won the presidency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We got some senators.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We got some — all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I said to myself, you know — and I said to somebody that was in the room — I said, you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires.",0,0,1,1,0,1
They’re fake.,0,0,1,1,0,0
They’re not true.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"And isn’t that a shame, because he’d rather be working on health care.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He’d rather be working on tax reform, Jim.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I mean that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I sort of understand there’s a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody — for whatever reason.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I understand that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you’ve got to be at least a little bit fair.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that’s why the public sees it — they see it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They see it’s not fair.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the public is smart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They understand it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, yeah, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have no doubt that your latest story is (inaudible).,0,0,0,0,0,0

And secondly —,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think they don’t believe it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I don’t think the public would.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t think they believe it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I guess one of the reasons I’m here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing — that’s a ruse.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s a ruse.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, tomorrow you’ll say, Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It’s not terrible — it’s good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"You know what uranium is, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s this thing called nuclear weapons and other things.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Nobody talks about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn’t do anything for Russia.,0,1,1,0,0,0
I’ve done nothing for Russia.,0,1,1,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium.,1,1,0,1,0,1
"Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Here, take a look.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton — that was a reset.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Remember?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It said ""reset.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

That’s not great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s not great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would love to be able to get along with Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, you’ve had a lot of Presidents that haven’t taken that tact.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Look where we are now.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I do it really well and all that stuff, but it’s possible I won’t be able to get along with Putin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people — the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia.",0,0,1,0,0,0

Okay?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that’s a shame.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because if we could get along with Russia — and, by the way, China and Japan and everyone — if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, since you —",0,0,0,0,0,0
Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We’re doing Obamacare — we’re in final stages.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It’s not like — frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So we’ll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And after that, we’re going to come up — and we’re doing very well on tax reform.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, you mentioned Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let’s talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as President of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You mentioned the vessel, the spy vessel, off the coast of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Not good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation —,0,1,1,1,0,1
Not good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
— of the agreement between the two countries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.,0,1,1,1,0,1
Not good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I listened to you during the campaign —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Excuse me, excuse me, when did it happen?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It happened when — if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, we’re back to the old games with the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There’s no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the — you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, oh, isn’t that wonderful.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But I know you well enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldn’t have done that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Look, of all —",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m just trying to find out your orientation to those —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait a minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wait, wait.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me just one second.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m just trying to find out what you’re doing to do about them, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he’s not going to be able to make a deal with me because it’s politically not popular for me to make a deal.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed.",0,0,1,1,0,0
They all tried.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I’m different than those people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How are you interpreting those moves?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what do you intend to do about them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just the way I said it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I’m so beautifully represented.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m so honored that the Senate approved him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He’s going to be fantastic.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I think that I’ve already —",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I don’t think so.",0,1,0,0,0,0
I think Putin probably assumes that he can’t make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician, but I guess that’s what I am now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we’re not going to make a deal.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, I don’t know that we’re going to make a deal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t know.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"We might, we might not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it would be much easier for me to be so tough — the tougher I am on Russia, the better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along — and don’t forget, we’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.",0,0,0,0,0,1
There’s no upside.,0,1,0,0,0,0
We’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I’ve been briefed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we’re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when you say they’re not good, do you mean that they are —",0,0,0,0,0,0
Who did I say is not good?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"No, when I read off the three things that have recently happened and each one of them you said they’re not good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, it’s not good, but they happened.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But do they damage the relationship?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do they undermine this country’s ability to work with Russia?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They all happened recently, and I understand what they’re doing, because they’re doing the same thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Does anybody in this room really believe that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I tell you one thing: She tried to make a deal.,0,1,1,0,0,0
She had the reset.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She gave all the valuable uranium away.,0,0,0,1,0,0
She did other things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, they say I’m close to Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States.,0,1,0,1,1,1
She’s close to Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I gave — you know what I gave to Russia?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what I gave?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nothing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?,0,0,1,0,0,0
I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t talk about military response.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are going to attack Mosul in four months. Then three months later: ""We are going to attack Mosul in one month."" ""Next week, we are going to attack Mosul."" In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult.",0,1,1,0,0,1
Do you know why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You’re going to be surprised to hear that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I don’t have to tell you —,0,0,0,0,0,0
There will be a response?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, ""Yes, here’s what we’re going to do.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
 I don’t have to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There will be a — in other words, there will be a response, Mr. President?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait a minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because they shouldn’t know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship — the Russian ship, as an example — I’m not going to tell you.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I’m not going to tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thanks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Can I just ask you — thank you very much, Mr. President — the Trump —",0,0,0,0,0,0
Where are you from?,0,0,0,0,0,0
BBC.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here’s another beauty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s a good line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Impartial, free, and fair.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, sure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. President —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just like CNN, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, on the travel ban — we could banter back and forth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the travel ban, would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government, that fine-tuned —",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, I do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And let me tell you about the travel —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Were there any mistakes in that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wait, wait, wait.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know who you are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just wait.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me tell you about the travel ban.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court.",0,1,0,0,0,0
We got a bad decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We had a court that’s been overturned — again, maybe wrong, but I think it’s 80 percent of the time.",0,0,1,1,0,1
A lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We had a bad decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to keep going with that decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to put in a new executive order next week sometime.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we had a bad decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban.,0,0,0,1,0,0
You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Despite that, the only problem that we had is we had a bad court.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Very bad for the safety and security of our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The rollout was perfect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order but said one thing — and I said this to my people: Give them a one-month period of time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month — the bad ones.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You do agree, there are bad people out there, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re not everybody that’s like you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have some bad people out there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So Kelly said, you can’t do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And he was right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"I said, how about one week?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said, no good.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"You got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they don’t have time to come in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, nobody ever reports that, but that’s why we did it quickly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, if would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The problems is we would have wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, in the meantime, we’ve vetting very, very strongly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Very, very strongly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we need help, and we need help by getting that executive order passed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Just a brief follow-up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if it’s so urgent, why not introduce —",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just was hoping that we could get a yes- or-no answer on one of these questions involving Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
So that’s one person.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But he was dealing — as he should have been —,0,0,0,0,0,0
During the election?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, nobody that I know of.",0,1,0,0,0,0
So you’re not aware of any contacts during the course of the election?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, look, how many times do I have to answer this question?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you just say yes or no on it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Russia is a ruse.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, I know you have to get up and ask a question, so important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Russia is a ruse.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have nothing to do with Russia, haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years.",0,1,0,1,1,0
Don’t speak to people from Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not that I wouldn’t, I just have nobody to speak to.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I spoke to Putin twice.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"He called me on the election — I told you this — and he called me on the inauguration, and a few days ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We had a very good talk, especially the second one — lasted for a pretty long period of time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified, so I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we had a very, very good talk.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have nothing to do with Russia.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, Manafort has totally denied it.",0,1,1,1,0,0
He denied it.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that — whoever.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But people knew that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Everybody knew that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have — you know what, he said no.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I can only tell you what he — now, he was replaced long before the election.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"You know that, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
He was replaced long before the election.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also, by the way — Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place.",0,0,0,1,0,1
He was only there for a short period of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"How much longer should we stay here, folks?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Five more minutes, is that okay?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Five?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, on national security —",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wait, let’s see, who’s — I want to find a friendly reporter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you a friendly reporter?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Watch how friendly he is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wait, wait — watch how friendly he is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, first of all, my name is (inaudible) from (inaudible) Magazine.",0,0,0,0,0,0

She was a very private person.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She was always the highest quality that you’ll ever find.,0,0,0,0,0,0

That was very professional and very good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m very professional.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’ll be announcing the order in a little while, and I’d rather let the order speak for itself.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it will be something I think that will be very good for everybody concerned.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we’ll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it’s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"We did much higher than people thought I was going to get and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And, by the way, if I might add, including the women’s vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities having to do with education, having to do with crime.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to try and fix as quickly as possible — you know it takes a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It’s taken 100 years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved many of them very badly.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"It’s a great question, and it’s a very difficult situation, because it’s been many, many years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It’s been festering for many, many years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have places in this country that we have to fix.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about, and that you talk about every night on the newscasts.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Let’s go set up a meeting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would love to meet with the Black Caucus.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was all set to have the meeting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set.",0,1,0,0,0,0
I spoke to him on the phone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Very nice guy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He wanted it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we called, called, called, called — they can’t make a meeting with him.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Every day, I walked in, I said, I would like to meet with him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because I do want to solve the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that — some other lightweight — he was probably told — he was probably told, don’t meet with Trump, it’s bad politics.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And that’s part of the problem of this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, one more.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, Mr. President, two questions —",0,0,0,0,0,0

One question.,0,0,0,0,0,0

(Inaudible),0,0,0,0,0,0
it’s not about your personality or your beliefs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re talking about (inaudible),0,0,0,0,0,0
"around the country, some of it by supporters in your name.",0,0,0,1,0,0
What do you —,0,0,0,0,0,0
And some of it — and can I be honest with you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Some of it written by our opponents.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You do know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you understand that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side, and you think it’s like playing it straight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They’ll do signs and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It won’t be my people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You are the President now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What are you going to do about it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Where is that?,0,0,0,0,0,0

I didn’t come along and divide this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This country was seriously divided before I got here.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We’re going to work on it very hard.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One of the questions that was asked — I thought it was a very good question — was about the inner cities.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Good luck to you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, let's begin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're calling this opening segment ""Achieving Prosperity.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
And central to that is jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are two economic realities in America today.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want us to invest in you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want us to invest in your future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We also have to make the economy fairer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How are we going to do it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, the same question to you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have up to two minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Lester.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our jobs are fleeing the country.,0,1,0,1,0,1
They're going to Mexico.,0,1,0,0,0,0
They're going to many other countries.,0,1,0,1,0,1
You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And we have a very good fight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have a winning fight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"With the United States, as he said, not so much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So Ford is leaving.,1,1,0,1,0,0
"You see that, their small car division leaving.",1,1,0,1,0,0
"Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.",1,1,0,1,0,0
They're all leaving.,0,1,0,0,0,0
And we can't allow it to happen anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They left -- fired 1,400 people.",0,1,1,1,0,1
They're going to Mexico.,0,1,0,0,0,0
So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.,0,1,0,0,0,1
We cannot let it happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Companies will come.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They will build.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They will expand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
New companies will start.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I look very, very much forward to doing it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think that trade is an important issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.",0,0,1,0,0,0
That is not how we grow the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I understand that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.",1,0,0,1,0,1
I don't buy that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a different experience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My father was a small-businessman.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He worked really hard.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans.",0,0,0,1,0,1
How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.",1,0,0,0,0,1
Our country's in deep trouble.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"They're the best, the best ever at it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
So we have to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to renegotiate our trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Let me give you the example of Mexico.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They have a VAT tax.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We're on a different system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"When they sell into us, there's no tax.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It's a defective agreement.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want you to be very happy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's very important to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.",0,0,0,0,0,1
She's been doing this for 30 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And why hasn't she made the agreements better?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The NAFTA agreement is defective.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me interrupt just a moment, but...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They should have been doing this for years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"We cannot do it any longer, Lester.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Back to the question, though.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?",0,0,0,0,0,0
How do you make them bring the jobs back?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The companies are leaving.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.",0,1,0,1,0,0
"And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We wish you a lot of luck.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to stop them from leaving.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's a big, big factor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.",0,1,0,1,1,1
"He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.""",0,1,0,0,1,0
"Well, it did collapse.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"That's called business, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.,0,1,1,1,0,1
Five million people lost their homes.,0,1,0,1,0,1
And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"Now, we have come back from that abyss.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And it has not been easy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.",1,1,0,1,0,1
Take clean energy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.,1,1,1,1,1,1
I think it's real.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I did not.,0,1,0,1,0,0
I did not.,0,1,0,1,0,0
I do not say that.,0,1,0,1,1,0
I think science is real.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do not say that.,0,1,0,1,1,0
"And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And here's what we can do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We can have enough clean energy to power every home.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can build a new modern electric grid.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0
She talks about solar panels.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We invested in a solar company, our country.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That was a disaster.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They lost plenty of money on that one.,0,1,1,1,0,0
"Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Our energy policies are a disaster.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.",0,1,1,1,0,1
You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.",0,1,0,1,1,1
"He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.",0,0,0,1,1,1
So I will tell you this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You've been doing this for 30 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, actually...",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will bring -- excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will bring back jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can't bring back jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, for 30 years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I have -- well, not quite that long.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, he approved NAFTA...",1,0,0,1,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"million new jobs, a balanced budget...",0,1,0,0,0,0

Will they create jobs in America?,0,1,0,0,0,0
Will they raise incomes in America?,0,1,0,0,0,0

Some of them I voted for.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to have a special prosecutor.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.",0,1,0,1,0,1
We increased them to China 50 percent.,0,1,0,1,0,1
So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Very quickly...,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, I've been a senator, Donald...",0,0,0,0,0,0
You haven't done it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You haven't done it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have been a secretary of state...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have done a lot...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.",1,0,0,1,0,1

That is your opinion.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.",0,1,0,0,0,1
And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You were totally in favor of it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Nothing will ever top NAFTA.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Well, that is just not accurate.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.,0,1,0,1,0,1
I wrote about that in...,0,0,0,0,0,0
You called it the gold standard.,1,1,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
You called it the gold standard of trade deals.,1,1,0,0,1,0
You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.,1,0,0,0,1,1
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...",0,1,0,1,0,1
Not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I wrote about that in my book...,0,0,0,0,0,0
So is it President Obama's fault?,0,0,1,0,0,0
before you even announced.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is it President Obama's fault?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Look, there are differences...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because he's pushing it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But you have no plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We're going to move to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we have a very robust set of plans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.",0,1,1,1,0,1
You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.,0,1,0,1,0,1
You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.,0,1,0,1,0,1
You are going to drive business out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.",0,1,0,1,1,1
I'm very proud of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm going to cut regulations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.",0,0,1,0,0,0

We're going to talk taxes...,0,0,0,0,0,0
That can't -- that can't be left to stand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...",0,0,1,0,0,1
Facts.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because what I have proposed...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.",0,1,1,1,0,1
What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you just opened the next segment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, could I just finish -- I think I...",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm going to give you a chance right here...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.",0,0,0,0,0,0

She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"Mr. Trump, I'm going to...",0,0,0,0,0,0
And look at her website.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's no difference than this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's telling us how to fight ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just go to her website.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"No, we're not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.",0,0,1,0,0,0
No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"OK, you are unpacking a lot here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I want to talk about taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I'd like you to further defend that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I'd like you to defend that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They're going to expand their companies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're going to do a tremendous job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's a great thing for the middle class.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a great thing for companies to expand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.",0,1,1,1,0,0
Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And here's the thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.",0,1,0,1,0,1
I happen to think it's double that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have no leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why not?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why not?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, why not?",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...",0,0,1,0,0,0
There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've looked at your tax proposals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I happen to support that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then you didn't read it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.",0,0,0,1,0,0
You've proposed an approach that has a...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Who gave it that name?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The first I've -- who gave it that name?,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
$4 billion tax benefit for your family.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And when you look at what you are proposing...,0,0,0,0,0,0
How much?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How much for my family?,0,0,0,0,0,0
it is...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Lester, how much?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Trickle-down did not work.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think top-down works in America.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, we're...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Typical politician.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All talk, no action.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Sounds good, doesn't work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Never going to happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.",0,1,0,1,1,1
And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we better be awfully careful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have a Fed that's doing political things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This Janet Yellen of the Fed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.",0,0,1,0,0,1
The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?,0,0,1,0,0,1
I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.,0,1,0,0,0,0
And it'll be released.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.",1,1,1,1,0,1
You know what that is?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?",0,0,1,0,0,0
We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The IRS says an audit...,0,0,0,0,0,1
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.",0,1,0,1,0,0
I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"I said, do you get audited?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I get audited almost every year.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And in a way, I should be complaining.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm not even complaining.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't mind it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's almost become a way of life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I get audited by the IRS.,0,0,0,1,0,1
But other people don't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"As soon as she releases them, I will release.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I will release my tax returns.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will tell you this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"When the audit's complete, I'll do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So it's negotiable?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's not negotiable, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let her release the e-mails.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why did she delete 33,000...",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, I'll let her answer that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me just admonish the audience one more time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There was an agreement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think there may be a couple of reasons.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.",1,1,1,1,1,1
That makes me smart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.",0,0,1,0,0,1
They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And we'll guess.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Who does he owe money to?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you want to respond to that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.",0,0,1,0,0,0
That's for sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm not going to make any excuses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was more than a mistake.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That was done purposely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was not a mistake.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That was done purposely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.",0,1,1,1,0,0
"And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.",1,0,0,0,0,0
That I can tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You learn a lot from financial disclosure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you should go down and take a look at that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.",0,0,1,1,0,1
It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And the $650 isn't even on that.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But it's not $650.,0,0,0,1,0,1
It's much less than that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I could do that very quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am very underleveraged.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I have a great company.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a tremendous income.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Our airports are like from a third world country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So the worst of all things has happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.",0,0,1,1,0,1
We haven't even started.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And it's really a shame.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Our country has tremendous problems.,0,1,0,0,0,0
We're a debtor nation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're a serious debtor nation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.",0,0,1,1,0,0
We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.,0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And the other thing I think is important...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It would be squandered, too, believe me.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.",0,1,0,1,0,1
We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It's a beautiful facility.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It immediately was put to use.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...",0,0,1,0,0,0
Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, to...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Which our country should do, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?",0,1,1,0,0,0
I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.",1,1,0,1,1,1
There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You call yourself the King of Debt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You talk about leverage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Wrong.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Wrong.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's let Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we need to be very clear about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I built an unbelievable company.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's an unbelievable company.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.",1,0,0,1,0,1
"And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's what I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll give you an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But we're opening the Old Post Office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I'm a year ahead of schedule.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And that's what this country should be doing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And we should be able to do that for our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We move into our next segment talking about America's direction.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And let's start by talking about race.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So how do you heal the divide?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you're right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Race remains a significant challenge in our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.",0,1,0,1,0,1
We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And we've got to do several things at the same time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to restore trust between communities and the police.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"So we have to do two things, as I said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to restore trust.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to work with the police.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How do you heal the divide?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we need law and order.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"You walk down the street, you get shot.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.",0,1,0,1,1,1
Thousands of shootings.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And I'm saying, where is this?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Is this a war-torn country?,0,1,0,0,0,0
What are we doing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have to stop the violence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to bring back law and order.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.",1,1,1,1,0,1
We have to bring back law and order.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It brought the crime rate way down.,0,0,1,1,0,0
But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have gangs roaming the street.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And they have guns.,0,1,0,0,0,0
And they shoot people.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And we have to be very strong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have to be very vigilant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"No, you're wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.",0,1,1,1,0,0
It was taken away from her.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.",0,0,1,1,0,1
They would have won an appeal.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.",0,0,1,0,0,0
These are felons.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.",0,0,1,1,0,1
You need more police.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You need a better community, you know, relation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't have good community relations in Chicago.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It's terrible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have property there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You need better relationships.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.",0,1,1,0,0,1
So there's some bad things going on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Some really bad things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.",0,1,1,0,0,1
Ugh.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.",1,0,1,1,0,0
It did not do what it needed to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I believe in community policing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Property crime is down 40 percent.,0,1,0,1,0,1
We just don't want to see it creep back up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.",0,1,1,1,1,1
So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We cannot just say law and order.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.",0,0,1,0,0,1
We need to have more second chance programs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.,0,1,0,1,0,1
You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So there are some positive ways we can work on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They admit it's an issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They've got a lot of concerns.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to respond to that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I agree with you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think you've apologized for it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But I think it was a terrible thing to say.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we went from 2,200 to 500.",0,1,0,1,0,1
And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And it was terminated by current mayor.,0,1,0,1,0,1
But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.,0,1,0,1,0,0
Tremendous beyond belief.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when you say it has no impact, it really did.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"It had a very, very big impact.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.",1,1,0,1,0,1
So there is...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, you're wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You're wrong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I'm not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Murders are up.,1,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You check it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
New York -- New York has done an excellent job.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, one murder is too many.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This conversation is about race.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd like to just respond, if I might.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Please -- 20 seconds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd just like to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.",0,1,1,0,0,1
They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Mr. Trump, let me...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I -- I do think...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You decided to stay home, and that's OK.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you, I've been all over.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, I...",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And, yes, I did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you know what else I prepared for?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I prepared to be president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that's a good thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen.",0,0,1,1,0,1
You questioned his legitimacy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Can you tell us what took you so long?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.",1,1,0,0,0,0
"Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.",1,1,0,1,0,1
They were pressing it very hard.,0,1,0,1,1,0
She failed to get the birth certificate.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"When I got involved, I didn't fail.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I got him to give the birth certificate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I'm satisfied with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will let you respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I just want to get the answer here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The birth certificate was produced in 2011.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...",0,0,0,0,0,1
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
as recently as January.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So the question is, what changed your mind?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But nobody was caring much about it.,0,1,0,0,0,0
But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think I did a good job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton also fought it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Look, it's true.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.",1,0,0,1,0,1
And she was involved.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I'm sorry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we're talking about racial healing in this segment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What do you say to Americans, people of color who...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it was very -- I say nothing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He should have produced it a long time before.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I say nothing.,0,1,0,0,0,0
But let me just tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you can see that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, just listen to what you heard.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But it can't be dismissed that easily.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.",0,1,1,1,1,1
He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.,0,1,1,1,0,1
So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.,0,0,1,1,0,0
And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would love to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You treated him with terrible disrespect.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It doesn't work that way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.",0,1,1,1,0,0
I don't think you can deny that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It really doesn't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.",0,1,1,1,0,1
We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.,0,1,0,1,0,1
It was very easy to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I notice you bring that up a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Maybe I'm trying to save the money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.",0,1,1,1,0,1
I'll go one step further.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's a tremendously successful club.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm so glad I did it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have been given great credit for what I did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'm very, very proud of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the way I feel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is the true way I feel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our next segment is called ""Securing America.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"So my question is, who's behind it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And how do we fight it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.",0,0,1,0,0,0
There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.",0,0,1,1,0,1
The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...",0,1,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"tough, long game here.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But we will defend the citizens of this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the Russians need to understand that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.,0,0,1,1,1,0
That is just unacceptable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...,0,0,1,1,0,1
Your two minutes have expired.,0,0,0,0,0,1
have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.,0,0,1,1,0,0
It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Who's behind it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And how do we fight it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"That just happened, and many more are coming.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And I'm very proud of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.",0,1,0,0,0,0
They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.,0,1,1,1,0,1
I was just endorsed by ICE.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because look at the mess that we're in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Look at the mess that we're in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.",0,1,1,0,0,1
It could also be lots of other people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?",0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't know who broke in to DNC.,0,1,1,0,0,1
But what did we learn with DNC?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Look what happened to her.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what we learned.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.",0,0,0,1,0,1
ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is -- it is a huge problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a son.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's 10 years old.,0,0,0,0,0,1
He has computers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And maybe it's hardly doable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.,0,0,0,1,0,0
It does involve going after them online.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We're making progress.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Our military is assisting in Iraq.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I'll ask this to both of you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.,0,0,1,1,0,0
We will take out ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.",0,1,1,0,0,1
And ISIS was formed.,0,1,0,1,0,0
So she talks about taking them out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's been doing it a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's been trying to take them out for a long time.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And then you wouldn't have had them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.",1,1,1,0,0,1
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.,0,1,0,1,0,0
Wrong.,0,1,0,0,0,0
That is absolutely proved over and over again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wrong.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Wrong.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the most important part of this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How do we prevent attacks?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How do we protect our people?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they brought him down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They're on the front lines.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I have to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Please respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Under your direction, to a large extent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.",0,0,0,1,0,1
They were choking on the sanctions.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I did really well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I have common sense.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I said, well, I'll tell you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But two things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And I was very strong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I said it numerous times.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And I think that's great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.,0,1,0,1,0,1
It's a lot of money to protect other people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm all for NATO.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I said they have to focus on terror, also.",0,0,0,0,1,0
And they're going to do that.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.,0,1,1,0,1,0
"I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Not only that, you named the day.",1,0,0,0,0,0
They couldn't believe it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They said...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Lester, we've covered...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, wait a minute.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've covered this ground.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It should have never happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Now it's in over 30 countries.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And you're going to stop them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion.,0,0,0,1,0,1
What makes your...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I did not support the war in Iraq.,0,1,1,1,1,0
In 2002...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"My question is, since you supported it...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Just -- would you like to hear...,0,0,0,0,0,0
why is your -- why is your judgment...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait a minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was against the war in Iraq.,1,0,0,1,0,0
Just so you put it out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...",0,0,1,0,0,0
The record does not show that.,0,1,0,1,0,1
Why was -- is your judgment any...,0,0,0,0,0,0
The record shows that I'm right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Essentially.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We talked about the economy is more important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.",1,0,1,1,0,0
Why is your judgment better than...,0,0,0,0,0,0
And when he -- excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that was before the war started.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was against the war.,1,0,0,1,0,0
"He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But nobody called Sean Hannity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I think in '04.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.",0,0,1,0,0,0
He and I used to have arguments about the war.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to destabilize the Middle East.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And that's exactly what it's done.,0,0,0,1,0,0
It's been a disaster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You didn't hear what I said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I have much better judgment than she does.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There's no question about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.",0,1,1,1,0,1
I have a winning temperament.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know how to win.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She does not have a...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whew, OK.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.",0,0,1,1,0,1
They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.,0,0,0,1,0,1
They had built covert facilities.,0,0,0,1,0,1
They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we had sanctioned them.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.",0,0,1,1,0,1
So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.,0,1,1,1,0,1
And we did drive them to the negotiating table.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.",0,1,1,1,1,1
That's diplomacy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's coalition-building.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's working with other nations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.",0,1,1,0,0,0
That's not good judgment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That would not start a war.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And the worst part...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, they were taunting us.",0,0,1,0,0,0
of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...",0,1,1,1,0,0
Wrong.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"have a good time, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's lies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.",0,0,1,0,0,0
That is the number-one threat we face in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would like to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's a good one, though.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It well describes the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not an accurate one at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not an accurate one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with her on one thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Nuclear is the single greatest threat.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.",0,1,0,0,1,1
They do not pay us.,0,1,0,1,1,1
"But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.",0,0,1,1,0,1
That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...",0,1,1,1,0,1
We need to move on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, wait, but it's very important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're a country that owes $20 trillion.,0,0,0,1,0,1
They have to help us out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our last...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is the single greatest threat that this country has.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Do you support the current policy?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.,0,1,0,1,0,1
We have not been updating from the new standpoint.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I looked the other night.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.",0,1,0,0,0,1
We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I would certainly not do first strike.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"At the same time, we have to be prepared.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I can't take anything off the table.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.",0,0,1,0,0,1
China should solve that problem for us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
China should go into North Korea.,0,1,0,0,0,0
China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Iran has power over North Korea.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't you add other things into the deal?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.",1,0,0,1,1,0
Nobody's ever seen that before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That turned out to be wrong.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.",1,0,1,1,0,1
It certainly looks that way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.,0,1,0,0,0,1
The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Your two minutes is expired.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And they're going to end up getting nuclear.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Believe me, he's not a happy camper.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Words matter when you run for president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they really matter when you are president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is essential that America's word be good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've talked with a number of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And Donald never tells you what he would do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Would he have started a war?,0,1,0,0,0,0
Would he have bombed Iran?,0,1,1,0,0,0
"If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.",0,0,1,1,0,0
But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.",0,1,1,0,0,0
So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Can they rely on us?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what I intend to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...,0,0,1,0,0,0
Your two minutes is...,0,0,0,0,0,0
to be given any opportunities at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
is expired.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Lester, one thing I'd like to say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Very quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Twenty seconds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will go very quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's a big problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.",0,0,1,1,0,1
We cannot be the policemen of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We cannot protect countries all over the world...,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have just...,0,0,0,0,0,0
where they're not paying us what we need.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have just a few final questions...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We need heart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need a lot of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you have to have some basic ability.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And sadly, she doesn't have that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they weren't taken care of.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, ""a presidential look.""",0,0,0,1,0,0
She's standing here right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What did you mean by that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
She doesn't have the look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She doesn't have the stamina.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I said she doesn't have the stamina.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I don't believe she does have the stamina.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The quote was, ""I just don't think she has the presidential look.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have -- wait a minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wait a minute, Lester.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You asked me a question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did you ask me a question?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?",0,1,1,0,0,0
"And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?",0,1,1,0,0,0
All you have to do is speak to them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's let her respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.",0,1,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
The world -- let me tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it's bad, bad experience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.",0,1,0,1,0,1
I agree.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She's got experience, but it's bad experience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are at -- we are at the final question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, one thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One thing, Lester.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Very quickly, because we're at the final question now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...",0,1,0,0,1,0
I never said that.,0,1,0,1,0,0
women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.,1,0,0,0,0,1
I didn't say that.,0,1,0,1,0,0
And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy.""",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Donald, she has a name.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Where did you find this?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Where did you find this?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Her name is Alicia Machado.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Where did you find this?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, really?",0,0,0,0,0,0
she's going to vote this November.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK, good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just tell you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Some of it's said in entertainment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you want to know the truth?,0,0,0,0,0,0

(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers — who I love — and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States a vast fortune.",0,1,0,0,0,1
Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates.,1,1,1,1,0,1
"This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs — not what we need — believe me, this is not what we need — including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"According to this same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors:  paper down 12 percent; cement down 23 percent; iron and steel down 38 percent; coal — and I happen to love the coal miners — down 86 percent; natural gas down 31 percent.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income and, in many cases, much worse than that.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States — which is what it does -– the world’s leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world’s leading polluters.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13.",1,1,0,1,0,1

India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.,0,1,0,1,0,1

"Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.",1,0,0,1,0,1
We’re having a big opening in two weeks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places.",0,0,0,0,0,0

China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.,1,1,0,0,0,1
"So we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.",1,0,0,1,0,1
India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.,0,1,0,1,0,1
Think of it:  India can double their coal production.,0,1,0,1,0,1
We’re supposed to get rid of ours.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"In short, the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.",0,1,1,1,0,1
This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement — they went wild; they were so happy — for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage.",0,1,0,1,0,1
A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.,0,0,1,0,0,1
We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have among the most abundant energy reserves on the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Yet, under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation — it’s great wealth, it’s phenomenal wealth; not so long ago, we had no idea we had such wealth — and leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.",0,1,1,1,0,1
The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand, but at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country —",0,0,0,1,0,1

"— will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts, our businesses will come to a halt in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree — think of that; this much — Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Tiny, tiny amount.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America — and this is an incredible statistic — would totally wipe out the gains from America’s expected reductions in the year 2030, after we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories, and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes.",0,1,1,1,0,1

One of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris, under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"And we’ll make it good, and we won’t be closing up our factories, and we won’t be losing our jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that’s much better than the Paris Accord.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But until we do that, we’re out of the agreement.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I will work to ensure that America remains the world’s leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
No responsible leader can put the workers — and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries, should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement:  It’s to give their country an economic edge over the United States.",0,0,1,1,0,1
That’s not going to happen while I’m President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m sorry.,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country’s expense.,0,0,0,1,0,1

"The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.",0,1,1,1,0,1
You see what’s happening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
At what point does America get demeaned?,0,0,0,0,0,0
At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.",0,0,0,0,0,1

Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.,0,0,0,1,0,1

The process has begun from day one.,0,0,0,1,0,1
But now we’re down to business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America’s existing and massive foreign aid payments.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"So we’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime.",0,1,0,1,0,1
The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion — nobody else is even close; most of them haven’t even paid anything — including funds raided out of America’s budget for the war against terrorism.,0,1,1,1,0,1
That’s where they came.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Believe me, they didn’t come from me.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They came just before I came into office.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Not good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And not good the way they took the money.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"In 2015, the United Nation’s departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as ""peanuts,"" and stated that ""the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog.""",0,1,0,1,0,1
"In 2015, the Green Climate Fund’s executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And nobody even knows where the money is going to.,1,1,1,0,0,0
"Nobody has been able to say, where is it going to?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course, the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.",0,1,1,1,0,1
America is $20 trillion in debt.,0,1,1,1,0,1
Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers or fix vital infrastructure.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Millions of our citizens are out of work.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So think of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America’s sovereignty.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I will.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America’s abundant energy reserves, which we have started very strongly.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal.",0,1,1,0,0,1
The risks grow as historically these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"In other words, the Paris framework is a starting point — as bad as it is — not an end point.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.",0,1,1,0,0,1
It is time to exit the Paris Accord —,0,0,0,0,0,0

The first topic is the Supreme Court.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I look forward to having that opportunity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Secretary Clinton, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, same question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Where do you want to see the court take the country?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.",0,0,1,1,0,0
And she was forced to apologize.,0,1,0,0,0,0
And apologize she did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They will have a conservative bent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They will be protecting the Second Amendment.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I believe that's very, very important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And those are the people that I will appoint.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, ""The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.""",0,0,1,1,0,1
"And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision.,0,0,0,0,0,1
What's wrong with that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I represented upstate New York.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It goes back to the founding of our country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.",1,0,0,1,1,1
"I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.",0,0,1,0,0,0
There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You mentioned the Heller decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.",0,0,1,1,0,1
So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me bring Mr. Trump in here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got.",0,0,0,1,0,1
How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.",0,1,1,0,0,0
I watched.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld.",0,1,0,0,0,0
And Justice Scalia was so involved.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it was a well-crafted decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry.",0,1,1,0,0,0
And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Were you extremely upset?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.",0,0,0,1,0,0
The gun lobby's on his side.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.,0,1,1,1,0,0
"And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines.",0,0,1,1,0,1
You support a national right to carry law.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Why, sir?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.",1,1,1,1,0,0
I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.,0,1,0,1,0,1
So I'm very honored by all of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you're pro-life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion?",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm asking you specifically.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Would you like to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is about what's happening right now in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.,1,0,0,1,0,0
He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.,1,1,1,1,0,0
I will defend Planned Parenthood.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton…,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have come too far to have that turned back now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions.",1,1,1,1,1,1
And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, your reaction?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think it's terrible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.",1,1,0,1,0,0
"Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.",1,1,0,0,0,0
And that's not acceptable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that is not what happens in these cases.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I do not believe the government should be making it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will stand up for that right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Nobody has that.,0,1,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's move on to the subject of immigration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border.",0,1,0,1,0,0

"The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have two minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.",0,1,1,1,0,0
We need strong borders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.",0,1,1,1,0,1
You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They're coming in illegally.,0,0,1,1,0,1
Drugs are pouring in through the border.,0,0,1,1,0,1
We have no country if we have no border.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary wants to give amnesty.,0,1,0,1,1,0
She wants to have open borders.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.",0,1,0,1,0,1
First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.,0,0,0,1,0,1
It means their job is tougher.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But they know what's going on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They know it better than anybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They want strong borders.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They feel we have to have strong borders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was up in New Hampshire the other day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.",0,0,1,0,0,0
All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.,0,0,1,1,1,1
It's just pouring and destroying their youth.,0,0,1,0,1,0
It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to have strong borders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to keep the drugs out of our country.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.",0,1,0,0,0,0
We need strong borders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Now, I want to build the wall.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need the wall.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.",0,1,0,0,0,0
We stop the drugs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We shore up the border.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Same question to you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you're right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to rip families apart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to be sending parents away from children.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We have 11 million undocumented people.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.",0,0,0,1,0,1
He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.,0,1,1,1,1,1
"Now, here's what that means.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.",0,1,1,0,0,0
I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I have been for border security for years.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I voted for border security in the United States Senate.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.",0,1,0,1,0,1
Didn't even raise it.,0,1,0,1,0,0
He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.,0,1,1,1,0,1
So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to follow up...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Chris, I think it's...",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think I should respond to that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Very nice man.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Believe me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.",1,1,0,1,0,1
It's a disaster.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.,0,1,1,1,1,0
Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.,0,1,0,1,1,1
"Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.",0,1,1,0,0,1
But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.,0,1,1,1,0,0
"Well, let me -- wait, wait, sir, let me...",0,0,0,0,0,0
We are a country of laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We either have -- and by the way...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, wait.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to hear from...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well -- well, but she said one thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I voted for border security, and there are...",0,0,0,1,0,0
And the wall.,0,1,0,0,0,0
There are some limited places where that was appropriate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.",0,1,1,0,0,1
And Donald knows a lot about this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.,1,1,1,1,1,1

We either have a border or we don't.,0,0,0,0,0,0

They're waiting.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.",1,0,1,1,0,1
"You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I want to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.,1,1,0,1,0,1
"Secretary Clinton, I want to...",0,0,0,0,0,0
We will not have open borders.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That is...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me -- Secretary...",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is a rank mischaracterization.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And this used to be a bipartisan issue.,0,0,1,1,0,0
Ronald Reagan was the last president...,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Secretary Clinton, excuse me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote.",0,0,1,1,0,1
My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.,1,0,0,0,0,1
So that's the question...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Please quiet, everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Is that your dream, open borders?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined.",1,0,0,1,0,1
"And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that would be a great benefit to us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Those are the questions we need answered.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Well?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?",0,0,0,1,0,0
How did we get on to Putin?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hold on -- hold on, wait.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hold on, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because we -- this is going to end up getting out of control.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's try to keep it quiet so -- for the candidates and for the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So just to finish on the borders...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes?,0,0,0,0,0,0
She wants open borders.,0,1,0,1,0,0
People are going to pour into our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People are going to come in from Syria.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.",0,1,1,1,1,1
They have no idea where they come from.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.",0,1,0,1,0,0
Now we can talk about Putin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't know Putin.,0,1,0,1,1,0
He said nice things about me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we got along well, that would be good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He has no respect for her.,0,1,0,0,0,0
He has no respect for our president.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And she's playing chicken.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, Putin...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wait, but...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"from everything I see, has no respect for this person.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
No puppet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
No puppet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's pretty clear...,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're the puppet!,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's pretty clear you won't admit...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, you're the puppet.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.",1,0,1,1,1,0
So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.",1,1,1,1,1,1
I find that deeply disturbing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's time you take a stand...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.",1,1,1,0,0,0
I am not quoting myself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She has no idea.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I am quoting 17...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary, you have no idea.",0,0,1,0,0,0
17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...,0,0,1,0,0,0
And our country has no idea.,0,1,1,0,0,0
agencies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, I doubt it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I doubt it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I find that just absolutely...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.,0,1,0,1,0,0
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
He's outsmarted her every step of the way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do get to ask some questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, that's fine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I would like to ask you this direct question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?",0,0,1,0,0,0
By Russia or anybody else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You condemn their interference?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course I condemn.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course I -- I don't know Putin.,0,0,0,1,1,0
I have no idea.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I'm not asking -- I'm asking do you condemn?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I never met Putin.,0,1,0,1,0,0
This is not my best friend.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whether it's Syria, you name it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Missiles.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"They create warheads, and we can't.",0,1,1,0,0,1
The Russians can't believe it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
She has been outsmarted by Putin.,0,1,0,0,0,0
And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They've taken over.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We've spent $6 trillion.,0,0,0,1,0,1
They've taken over the Middle East.,0,1,0,0,0,1
She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"We're a long way away from immigration, but I'm going to let you finish this topic.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You got about 45 seconds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And she always will be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He's...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wrong.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.",1,1,1,1,0,0
But here's the deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.",0,0,1,0,0,1
There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I have 200 generals...,0,0,0,1,0,0
Very quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We are spending a fortune doing it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They have the bargain of the century.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.",1,1,1,0,0,1
We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.,0,1,1,1,0,1
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways.",0,0,1,0,0,0
This is just another lie.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...",0,0,0,0,0,0
There's no quote.,1,1,0,0,0,0
You're not going to find a quote from me.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks.",1,0,0,1,0,0
That kind...,0,0,0,0,0,0
And defend yourselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
of language -- well...,0,0,0,0,0,0
And defend yourselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn't say nuclear.,0,1,0,0,0,0
And defend yourself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Donald wants to tear up our alliances.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to -- no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to drill down into this a little bit more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I want us to do more to help small business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.,0,1,0,1,0,1
So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.,1,1,0,1,0,1
"By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.",1,1,1,1,0,1
Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.",0,1,1,1,1,1
So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Secretary, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.",0,1,0,1,1,0
Her tax plan is a disaster.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And she can say all she wants about college tuition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm a big proponent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.",0,1,0,0,0,0
We protect Saudi Arabia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why aren't they paying?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Because they weren't paying.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They have to pay up.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"We're protecting people, they have to pay up.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I'm a big fan of NATO.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But they have to pay up.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.",1,1,0,1,0,1
We're up to $20 trillion.,1,1,0,1,0,1
So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have a lot of free trade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have horrible deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever.",1,1,0,1,0,1
Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.,1,1,0,1,0,1
"You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them.",0,1,0,0,0,1
You go upstate New York.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.,1,1,0,1,0,1
We're bringing our jobs back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to cut taxes massively.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to cut business taxes massively.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're going to start hiring people.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Time, Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
that's offshore back into the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...",0,0,0,0,0,0
You can't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I also will not add a penny to the debt.,1,1,0,0,0,0
I have costed out what I'm going to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, he mentioned the debt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We know how to get control of the debt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.",0,1,0,1,0,1
He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the kind of approach that will work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that.",0,0,0,1,0,0
It has not worked the way that it has been promised.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.",0,1,0,1,0,1
Correct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So is your plan basically more -- even more of the Obama stimulus?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it's a combination, Chris.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But it was a terrible recession.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is not going to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.",0,0,0,1,0,1

"Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up, that your idea, and you've talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent...",0,0,1,1,0,1
Over a 10-year period.,0,0,0,0,0,0
growth is unrealistic.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they say -- you talk a lot about growing the energy industry.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that's unrealistic, as well.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Your response, sir?",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I just left some high representatives of India.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're growing at 8 percent.,0,1,0,1,0,1
China is growing at 7 percent.,0,1,0,1,0,1
And that for them is a catastrophically low number.,0,1,0,1,0,0
We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And I think it's going down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report.",0,1,0,1,0,1
A terrible jobs report.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad.",0,0,1,0,0,0
The report was so bad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, our country is stagnant.",0,1,1,0,0,0
We've lost our jobs.,0,1,0,0,0,0
We've lost our businesses.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I've visited so many communities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they cry when they see what's happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Boy, did they suffer.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0,1,0,1,0,0
And she wants it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.,1,1,0,1,1,0
She totally lied.,1,1,0,0,0,0
She did call it the gold standard.,1,1,0,1,1,0
"And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I was so honored.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy...",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that will be as bad as NAFTA.,0,0,0,0,0,0
which is Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But go ahead, briefly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.",1,1,0,0,0,1
It didn't meet my test.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I've had the same test.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm against it now.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I'll be against it after the election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll be against it when I'm president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.",0,1,0,1,0,1
But he mentioned China.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets.",0,1,1,1,0,1
I have fought against that as a senator.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I've stood up against it as secretary of state.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me just say -- let me just say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to pull the country together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Go ahead, Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me ask a simple question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's been doing this for 30 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I voted.",0,0,0,1,0,0
You were very much involved -- excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My turn.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you do have experience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I wouldn't mind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.",0,0,1,0,0,0
You don't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing.",1,1,1,1,1,1
How do you miss $6 billion?,1,0,0,0,0,0
"You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen.",1,1,1,1,1,1
They don't know.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"It's gone, $6 billion.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Believe me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.",0,0,1,1,0,1
But I think it's really an important issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.,0,1,1,1,1,1
"In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses.,1,0,0,1,0,1
"In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.",0,1,1,0,0,0
Give me a break.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ""Celebrity Apprentice.""",0,1,1,1,0,1
"So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think I did a much better job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars.",0,1,0,0,0,1
I started with a $1 million loan.,1,0,0,1,0,0
I agree with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a $1 million loan.,1,0,1,1,0,1
But I built a phenomenal company.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You would even be proud of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look at the migration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look at Libya.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look at Iraq.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.",1,1,1,0,1,1
She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.,1,0,0,0,1,0
And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.,0,0,1,1,0,1
And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's going to get rid of nobody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you'd never actually done it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent.",0,1,1,1,1,0
"Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up -- you deny this -- why would they all make up these stories?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you go first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.",1,0,0,1,1,0
Those people -- I don't know those people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a feeling how they came.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe it was her campaign that did it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's the one and Obama that caused the violence.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.",0,1,1,1,0,0
"I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's her campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"And that was now all on tape, started by her.",0,1,0,1,0,0
"I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they were all totally -- it was all fiction.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was lies, and it was fiction.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Well...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, what was his response?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.",1,1,1,1,0,0
I did not say that.,0,1,0,1,0,0
I did not say that.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"In fact, he went on to say...",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Her two minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I did not say that.,0,1,0,1,0,0
It's her two minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He went on to say, ""Look at her.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't think so.""",1,0,0,0,0,0
"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice.""",1,0,0,1,0,0
"He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her ""disgusting,"" as he has called a number of women during this campaign.",0,1,1,1,0,0
Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's who Donald is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"America is great, because America is good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody has more respect for women than I do.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Nobody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody has more respect...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Please, everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.",1,0,1,1,0,1
And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"What happened to the FBI, I don't know.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.",0,1,1,1,0,1
One lie.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.",0,1,0,1,0,0
He's going to probably go to jail.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This is a four-star general.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And it's not just about women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.",0,1,1,1,1,0
Wrong.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers ""people who aren't captured.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
"He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.",0,1,1,1,0,1
So it's not one thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.",0,1,1,0,0,0
That is not who America is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence.",0,0,0,1,0,0
It's on tape.,0,1,0,0,0,0
During the last...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things...",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"but those other charges, as she knows, are false.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"In this bucket about fitness to be president, there's been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to ask you about them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These are questions that the American people have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn't it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The State Department has said that.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I think that's been proven.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment.",0,0,0,1,1,1
In partnership with the American Health Association...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is -- this is an open discussion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it is an open discussion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the specific question went to pay for play.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you want to talk about that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is...",0,0,1,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that it's been very well...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's ask Mr. Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's been very well studied.,0,0,0,0,0,0
and the high rankings...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Please let me Mr. Trump speak.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Please let Mr. Trump speak.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a criminal enterprise.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.",0,1,1,1,1,1
You talk about women and women's rights?,0,0,0,0,0,0
So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.,0,1,1,1,0,0
These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.,0,0,1,1,1,0
And yet you take their money.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?",0,0,1,0,1,0
Why don't you give back the money?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it would be a great gesture.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because she takes a tremendous amount of money.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And you take a look at the people of Haiti.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.",1,0,0,1,0,1
I'm very proud of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.,1,0,0,1,0,1
"And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.",0,1,0,1,1,1
"I mean, who does that?",0,0,0,0,0,0
It just was astonishing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti.",0,1,0,0,0,1
Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years.,0,0,0,1,0,0

"We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
because it's an important part of the American experience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They don't want you to help them anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to mention one thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Trump Foundation, small foundation.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?",1,0,1,0,0,0
"No, it was -- we put up the American flag.",1,1,0,1,0,1
And that's it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They put up the American flag.,0,1,0,0,0,0
We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.,0,1,0,1,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation...",1,0,1,1,0,1
There was.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it.",0,1,1,1,1,1
You can look at our tax returns.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We've got them all out there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.,1,0,1,1,0,1
"And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.,0,1,1,1,0,1
I find that just astonishing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it.",1,0,1,1,0,1
"And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...",1,1,1,1,1,1
We...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just explain.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, no, we heard this...",0,0,1,0,0,0
Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, we -- OK.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what she should have done?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Folks, we heard this...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, you know...",0,0,0,0,0,0
You should have changed the law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...",0,0,0,0,0,1
Made with Chinese steel.,0,0,0,0,0,0

(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad.",0,0,1,0,0,0
All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you -- his words -- ""will absolutely accept the result of this election.""",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will look at it at the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not looking at anything now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll look at it at the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care.",0,1,1,0,0,1
It's so dishonest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think they're going to see through it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll find out on November 8th.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But I think they're going to see through it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, sir, there's...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.",1,0,1,1,1,1
So let me just give you one other thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I talk about the corrupt media.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She shouldn't be allowed to run.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.",0,0,1,1,0,0
She should not be allowed to run.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...",0,0,0,0,0,0
But...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But, sir, there is a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll keep you in suspense.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.",0,1,1,0,0,0
The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.,0,1,1,1,0,1
They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.,0,0,1,1,0,0
He lost the Iowa caucus.,0,1,0,1,0,0
He lost the Wisconsin primary.,0,1,0,1,0,0
He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.,0,1,1,1,0,1
There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.,0,1,1,1,1,1
Should have gotten it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
This is -- this is a mindset.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is how Donald thinks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So that is not the way our democracy works.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've been around for 240 years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We've had free and fair elections.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished...",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hold on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hold on, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hold on, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
it just shows you're not up to doing the job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful.",0,1,1,1,0,1
I think it's a disgrace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hold on, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This doesn't do any good for anyone.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Let's please continue the debate, and let's move on to the subject of foreign hot spots.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after?",0,0,1,0,0,0
And that's something that whichever of you ends up -- whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have two minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.",0,0,1,0,0,0
The goal here is to take back Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to be a hard fight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've got no illusions about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we know we've got lots of work to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Mr. Trump, same question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will -- would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We had Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul.",0,1,0,1,0,0
Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.,0,0,0,1,0,0
The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We announce we're going after Mosul.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?",0,1,0,0,0,0
These people have all left.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They've all left.,0,1,0,0,0,0
The element of surprise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They want to look good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.",0,0,1,1,0,0
That's why we have the great migration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But she wanted to look good for the election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So they're going in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But who's going to get Mosul, really?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll take Mosul eventually.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Much, much tougher.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Much more dangerous.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Going to be more deaths that they thought.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They say, what do we need this for?",0,0,0,0,0,0
So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So we're now going to take Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Iran.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sir, your two minutes are up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.",0,1,1,1,1,1
I said it was a mistake.,0,0,1,0,1,0
I've said that years ago.,0,0,0,0,1,0
He has consistently denied what is...,0,0,1,1,1,0
Wrong.,0,1,0,0,0,0
a very clear fact that...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wrong.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"before the invasion, he supported it.",1,1,0,1,0,0
"And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Google ""Donald Trump Iraq.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.,1,0,1,1,0,1
Wrong.,0,1,0,0,0,0
And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, why does that matter?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mosul is a Sunni city.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Mosul is on the border of Syria.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and we brought him to justice.",0,1,0,1,0,0
We need to go after the leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.,0,0,1,1,0,1
They've been digging underground.,0,1,1,0,0,1
They've been prepared to defend.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to be tough fighting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is what we have to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Chris, we don't gain anything.",0,1,1,0,0,0
He has all the conspiracy theories...,0,0,0,0,0,0

Iran is taking over Iraq.,0,1,1,1,0,1

Iran is taking over Iraq.,0,1,1,1,0,1
We don't gain anything.,0,1,0,0,0,0

"Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it's an open discussion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He says...,0,0,0,0,0,0

We could have gained if they did it by surprise.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right.",0,0,1,0,0,1
He said some beauties.,0,0,0,0,0,0

You do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you think that was good, then you do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I agree with both.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And he has said...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Which is a big mistake.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I think he's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's turn to Aleppo.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo.",0,0,0,0,0,1

It's a catastrophe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I mean...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's a catastrophe, but there...",0,0,0,0,0,0
it's a mess.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are a quarter of...,0,0,0,1,0,0
Have you seen it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Have you seen it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sir...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sir, if I may finish my question...",0,0,0,0,0,0

Take a look at it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered.",0,0,1,1,0,1
That's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they are being slaughtered...,0,0,1,1,0,1
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
because of bad decisions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I may just finish here, and you also said that -- that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"In fact, they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Would you like to clear that up, sir?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Aleppo is a disaster.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a humanitarian nightmare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, what do you need, a signed document?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look at Aleppo.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is so sad when you see what's happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.",0,0,0,1,0,1

"I mean, cash.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Bundles of cash as big as this stage.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Secretary Clinton, you have talked about -- and in the last debate and again today -- that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there.",0,0,1,1,0,1

"Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This would not be done just on the first day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This would take a lot of negotiation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's made these claims repeatedly.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.",0,1,0,1,0,1
So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Folks, I want to get into our final segment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I just have to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Real quick.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And right now, they're in 32 countries.",0,0,0,1,0,1
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We should have -- wait one second.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They are outplayed.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"Now, she wasn't there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I assume she had nothing to do with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran.",0,1,1,0,0,0
Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton -- no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That's the highest since just after World War II.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you go first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To do that, we're taking back jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore.",0,0,1,0,0,1
It's very sad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We used to be there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've given it up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've become very, very sloppy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.",0,1,0,1,0,0
"You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say.",0,0,1,0,0,1
But we don't use those people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We use political hacks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So we have to use our great people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ""Make America Great Again,"" I wonder when he thought America was great.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And before he rushes and says, ""You know, before you and President Obama were there,"" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.",0,1,1,1,0,1
He was criticizing President Reagan.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, ""You know, I alone can fix it,"" as he said on the convention stage.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I do not add a penny to the national debt.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"In fact, I think just the opposite.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's where growth will come from.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I want to invest in your family.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Could I just respond?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I disagreed with him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We should have been much tougher on trade even then.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've been waiting for years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody does it right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And frankly, now we're going to do it right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?",0,0,0,0,0,1
I'm cutting taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to grow the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not going to help in the entitlements.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, it's going to totally help you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's destroying our country.,0,1,1,0,0,0

"If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But Obamacare has to go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.",1,1,0,1,1,1
Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.,1,1,0,0,0,1
"And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Bad health care at the most expensive price.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Such a nasty woman.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will not cut benefits.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.,0,1,1,1,0,1
That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.,0,1,0,1,0,1

"Throughout the year, we have seen Democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we know it and take away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"Dishonestly called “Medicare for All,” the Democratic proposal would establish a government-run, single-payer health care system that eliminates all private and employer-based health care plans and would cost an astonishing $32.6 trillion during its first 10 years.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"As a candidate, I promised that we would protect coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions and create new health care insurance options that would lower premiums.",1,0,0,1,0,1
"I have kept that promise, and we are now seeing health insurance premiums coming down.",1,0,0,1,0,1
I also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare.,1,0,0,0,0,0
That is why I am fighting so hard against the Democrats' plan that would eviscerate Medicare.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing Medicare by more than $800 billion over 10 years to pay for Obamacare.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Likewise, Democrats would gut Medicare with their planned government takeover of American health care.",0,0,1,0,0,1
The Democrats' plan threatens America's seniors.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"The Democrats' plan means that after a life of hard work and sacrifice, seniors would no longer be able to depend on the benefits they were promised.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"By eliminating Medicare as a program for seniors, and outlawing the ability of Americans to enroll in private and employer-based plans, the Democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care.",1,1,0,1,0,1
Doctors and hospitals would be put out of business.,0,1,1,0,0,1
Seniors would lose access to their favorite doctors.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There would be long wait lines for appointments and procedures.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Previously covered care would effectively be denied.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"In practice, the Democratic Party’s so-called Medicare for All would really be Medicare for None.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"Under the Democrats' plan, today’s Medicare would be forced to die.",0,1,1,1,0,1
The Democrats' plan also would mean the end of choice for seniors over their own health care decisions.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Instead, Democrats would give total power and control over seniors’ health care decisions to the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"My family escaped socialism, now my fellow Democrats think we should move the party in its direction.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The first thing the Democratic plan will do to end choice for seniors is eliminate Medicare Advantage plans for about 20 million seniors as well as eliminate other private health plans that seniors currently use to supplement their Medicare coverage.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"Next, the Democrats would eliminate every American’s private and employer-based health plan.",0,1,0,1,0,1
It is right there in their proposed legislation: Democrats outlaw private health plans that offer the same benefits as the government plan.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"Americans might think that such an extreme, anti-senior, anti-choice and anti-consumer proposal for government-run health care would find little support among Democrats in Congress.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Unfortunately, they would be wrong: 123 Democrats in the House of Representatives — 64 percent of House Democrats — as well as 15 Democrats in the Senate have already formally co-sponsored this legislation.",1,0,1,1,0,1

Democrats want open-borders socialism.,1,0,1,0,0,0

Government-run health care is just the beginning.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Every single citizen will be harmed by such a radical shift in American culture and life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Virtually everywhere it has been tried, socialism has brought suffering, misery and decay.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Indeed, the Democrats' commitment to government-run health care is all the more menacing to our seniors and our economy when paired with some Democrats' absolute commitment to end enforcement of our immigration laws by abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",1,0,0,1,0,1
That means millions more would cross our borders illegally and take advantage of health care paid for by American taxpayers.,0,0,1,1,0,1
Today’s Democratic Party is for open-borders socialism.,1,0,0,0,0,0
This radical agenda would destroy American prosperity.,0,0,1,0,0,0

We’re very well along the way with Mexico.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The relationship is very good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And with Canada, we’ll see what happens.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re charging us 300-percent tariffs on dairy products.,0,1,1,1,0,1
We can’t have that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can’t have that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With China, as you know, we put out an announcement today.",0,1,0,0,0,1
They would like to see me lose an election because they’ve never been challenged like this.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But I want to open up China to our farmers and to our industrialists and our companies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And China is not open, but we’re open to them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They charge us 25, 35, 55 percent for things, and we charge them nothing in terms of coming into the country.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Cars, they’re at 25 percent.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"And we’re at 2 percent and 2.5 percent, and don’t even collect it.",0,1,1,1,0,1
But we collect it now.,0,0,0,1,0,0
So we’re doing very well in our situation with China on trade.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I have a great relationship with the President of China, President Xi.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it’s got to be a two-way street.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It — for 25 years and longer, it was not.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And trillions and trillions of dollars was taken out of the United States for the benefit of China.,0,1,1,1,0,1
We just can’t have that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to make it fair.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we’re at $250 billion now, at 25 percent interest.",0,1,0,1,0,1
And a lot of money is coming into our coffers.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And it’s had no impact on our — absolutely, by the way, no impact on our economy, which I said it wouldn’t.",0,1,1,1,0,0
"In fact, steel is like the hottest industry there is.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"If you look at what happened with steel, we’re charging a 25 percent tariff for the dumpers.",0,1,1,1,0,1
They dump massive amounts of steel.,0,1,1,1,0,1
They want to put the steel companies out of business.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"And after they’re out of business, they’ll come in and charge five times more than you ever thought possible.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And we need steel and we need aluminum.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And those industries are doing well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But steel is incredible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
U.S. Steel is opening up a minimum of eight plants.,1,0,0,1,0,1
Nucor is opening up plants.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"And these are big plants — $750 million and a billion dollar plants, in some cases.",0,1,1,1,0,1
So what’s happening with the steel industry is very exciting to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s being rebuilt overnight.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"If you look at the miners in coal, if you look at energy, LNG — Japan just gave us some numbers that are incredible.",0,0,0,1,0,1
They’re doubling the amount that they are going to be buying for Japan.,0,1,0,1,0,1
They’re taking the LNG and they’re doubling it up.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"I said, ""You have to do me a favor. We don’t want these big deficits. You’re going to have to buy more""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They’re buying massive amounts of equipment and military equipment, and other countries are doing the same thing.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Because we have trade imbalances with almost everybody.,0,0,0,1,0,0
It’s a rare exception that we don’t.,0,0,0,1,0,0
So we are doing great as a country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unfortunately, they just raised interest rates a little bit because we are doing so well.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"I’m not happy about that, because I know it’s going to be a question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I am not happy about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’d rather pay down debt or do other things, create more jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I’m worried about the fact that they seem to like raising interest rates.,0,0,1,0,0,1
We can do other things with the money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And — but they raised them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they’re raising them because we’re doing so well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we’re doing much better than I had projected in terms of — when I was campaigning, I said we were going to do this and we’re doing much better than anybody ever thought possible.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And, I will say, if others got in, it would have been just the opposite because they were going to put restrictions on.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They were going to put regulations on.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"They were going to choke the economy as it was already choking, but it would have been worse.",0,1,1,0,0,0
And they were going to raise your taxes.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"That’s what they want to do now if they ever got control, which I don’t think they’ll have control for a long time.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So, with that being said, we’ll take some questions and — yes, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"John, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have plenty of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, thank you very much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course, what you’re looking forward to tomorrow is the hearings with Judge Kavanaugh —",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
— before the Judiciary Committee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 1991, when Joe Biden passed along to the Bush 41 White House the allegations that Anita Hill had raised against Clarence Thomas, the Bush White House asked the FBI to look into it as part of Judge Thomas’s background investigation — not a criminal investigation, but the background investigation.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When these allegations were raised, why didn’t this White House do the same thing?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And with all of the allegations that are coming out now about Judge Kavanaugh, was there an opportunity missed here to have investigators look into this and get some sort of clarity one way or the other?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, the FBI told us they’ve investigated Judge Kavanaugh six times, five times, many times over the years.",0,1,1,1,0,1
They know him very well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But here, there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint.",1,0,1,0,0,0
They didn’t know the location.,1,1,0,0,0,1
They didn’t know the time.,1,0,0,0,0,0
They didn’t know the year.,1,1,0,0,0,1
They didn’t know anything.,1,1,0,0,0,0
"And it’s like, where do you go?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Also, it’s not for the FBI.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, ""They don’t do this""",1,0,1,0,0,1
And he said it very clearly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I think when you really look at it all, it’s not going to change any of the Democrats’ minds.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re obstructionists.,0,0,1,1,0,0
They’re actually con artists because they know how quality this man is and they’ve destroyed a man’s reputation and they want to destroy it even more.,0,1,1,0,0,1
And I think people are going to see that in the midterms.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What they’ve done to this family, what they’ve done to these children — these beautiful children of his — and what they’ve done to his wife.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they know it’s a big, fat con job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they go into a room and, I guarantee you, they laugh like hell at what they’ve pulled off on you and on the public.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They laugh like hell.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, it wouldn’t have mattered if the FBI came back with the cleanest score.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And you understand that very well, John.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If they would have come back with the most perfect — ""We found everything, and he’s perfectly innocent of everything""",0,0,0,0,0,0
It wouldn’t have made a difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You wouldn’t have gotten one vote.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now we will get votes from the Democrats if we win.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You’ll have three, four, or five Democrats giving us votes, because they’re in states that I won by 30 and 40 points and they’re going to give us votes.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"But other than that, you probably won’t get any, John.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Please.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, there are now three women accusing Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Are you saying that all three of those women are liars?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Is there anything that can be said at this point tomorrow —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
— that could cause you to withdraw the nomination?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Anything at all that —,0,0,0,0,0,0
I won’t get into that game.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’ll only tell you this: This is one of the highest quality people that I’ve ever met, and everybody that knows him says the same thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"You know, it’s very interesting — I pick a lot of judges.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have 145 judges I will be picking by the end of a fairly short period of time because President Obama wasn’t big on picking judges.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"When I got there, I said, ""How is this possible?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have 145 — including court of appeals — judges.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And they just didn’t do it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You know why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
They got tired.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They got complacent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Something happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have 145 judges.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Everybody wants to be a federal judge.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not just a Supreme Court judge, I’m talking about court of appeals; I’m talking about district court.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t think they’re going to want to so much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’ll be calling people, and we’ll have people calling people that do this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And people are going to be scared because we could say it about you, ""Thirty-five years ago, you met some…"" — and you might know — you might not know what’s going on.",0,0,1,0,0,0
What is going on?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why did they wait so long?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why did Senator Feinstein wait until the hearings were over and make this case?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn’t she bring it right at the beginning?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you ask about, as an example, the FBI — why didn’t they bring this right at the beginning, during the hearing?",0,0,1,0,0,0
You would have had all the time in the world for the FBI.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It would have been fine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now the FBI, as you know, did investigate this time, as they have five or six other times.",0,0,1,1,0,1

And Schumer and his buddies are all in there laughing how they fooled you all.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Let’s just stop them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A big fat con.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, Mr. President, if I could follow up.",0,0,0,0,0,0

They’re very good people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know many of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I’ve been very proactive against Cuba.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I don’t like what’s happening in Cuba.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Neither do Cuban people based in Miami and based in our country that came from Cuba and suffered in Cuba.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I don’t like what he did.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Mr. President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0

You said also that you had a call-to-action to ask the leaders around the world to also end socialism.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Would you like to be recognized as —,0,0,0,0,0,0

"You can take a look at Venezuela as your number one — your number one — I guess, the one that is most obvious.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, first of all, I wasn’t happy with Roy Moore.",0,0,0,0,0,0

One hundred percent.,0,1,0,1,0,0
So it really doesn’t matter from their standpoint.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That’s why when John asked about the FBI — if the FBI did the most thorough investigation in the history of the FBI, and they found him to be 100-percent perfect, he would lose every single vote.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Now, if the Republicans win tomorrow, I think you’re going to get some votes from the Democrats.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because — we all know why — because it’s called politics.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then you’ll probably get some votes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, let’s go.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And my final question, sir,",0,0,0,0,0,0
One more question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just to follow up —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She stands up: ""I’d like to ask about three questions""",0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s not really fair to everyone else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This will be my last one —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Should I let her ask another question?,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0

Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
See?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"— to follow up on a question that a colleague asked as well about the benefit of the doubt that you have given to people like Roy Moore, to Roger Ailes, to Bill O’Reilly, to Brett Kavanaugh.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re all men.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why is that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s not a benefit of the doubt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Has there ever been an instance when you’ve given the benefit of the doubt to a woman?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve known them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hallie, I’ve know them for a long time and — a lot of these people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot of people.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have been disappointed with some.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Others, like — you know, there are charges that are pretty weak.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But I’ve known people for a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I never saw them do anything wrong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I never saw them do anything wrong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there are some that probably — I agree.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can tell you there are some that I — I’ve been watching for a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in a couple of cases, they weren’t Republicans.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"In a lot of cases, they were not; they were exactly the opposite.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But I’ve been watching them for a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I knew for a long time these were not good people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they were never brought up.,0,1,0,0,0,1
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, ma’am.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much by the way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"When the allegations first surfaced, you initially said how important it was for Dr. Ford to testify and that you wanted to hear from her.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But —,0,0,0,0,0,0
I wish it could have gone quicker.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you also said that if what she said were as bad as she claims, surely her or her parents would have reported it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And just today, you said, you wouldn’t —",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, there is a truth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I mean there is a chance that her parents could have reported it 36 years ago.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So my question is —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It doesn’t mean they had to report it because, in some instances, people keep it quiet.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It’s a very tough situation for a woman, there’s no question about it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in some cases, they do report it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Frankly, had they reported it, it would’ve been pretty amazing, wouldn’t it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I guess they didn’t, and that’s okay.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m not saying they had to report it because it’s a very personal thing.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"It’s a very big problem, there’s no question about it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But do you want to hear her story before you draw a conclusion —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’d like to hear her story, yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we’re giving her a time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
— or have you already made up your mind?,0,0,0,0,0,0
They would’ve given her time last week.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the United States Senate.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"This is the most important position that a President can give out, I think we can say, by far.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve actually heard it’s the most important decision a President can make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I disagree with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"War and peace — I always say, ""War and peace""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I look forward to hearing from her.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We could’ve heard from her last week; we could have heard from her for a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’ll be interesting to hear what she has to say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And let me follow up on Jim’s question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, let me follow up on Jim’s question that I don’t think we got an answer to.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Which one?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Which question?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Who?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How have your personal experiences being accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct —,0,0,1,0,0,0
I’ve been accused.,0,1,0,1,0,0
I’ve been accused.,0,1,0,1,0,0
False accusations.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"— right, how have those —",0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve been accused.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"And I was accused by — I believe, it was — four women.",0,1,1,1,0,0
You can check with Sean Hannity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You can check with Fox, because they covered it very strongly — who got paid.",1,0,0,1,0,1
And how has (inaudible) —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me.,1,1,1,1,0,0
"We caught them, and the mainstream media refused to put it on television.",0,1,1,1,0,0
They refused to even write about it.,0,1,1,1,0,0
"There were four women, and maybe more — I think the number is four or five.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But one had a mortgage paid off her house, $52,000.",1,1,1,0,0,1
Another one had other things happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the one that reported it, I believe, was offered $750,000 to say bad things about me — and she is the one that reported it.",0,1,1,1,0,1
This woman is incredible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She reported it, instead of taking the money.",0,1,1,1,0,0
So I’ve had numerous accusations about me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, they made false statements about me, knowing they were false.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I never met them.,0,1,0,1,0,0
I never met these people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, what did they do?",0,0,0,0,0,0
What did they do?,0,0,0,0,0,0
They took money in order to say bad things.,1,0,1,0,0,0
I’ve had stories written in the New York Times — front page — about four women.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The whole top center front page of the New York Times.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I think it was four big pictures.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, ""Wow. That’s a big thing. What’s that?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
These were women that were quoted saying bad things about me.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Not the worst things about me, but bad things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I said, ""Gee, that’s too bad""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I knew them a long time ago — 15 years ago, 20 years ago.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I said, ""That’s too bad. I’m surprised at them.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
And then all of a sudden I see them on television — nothing to do with me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The next day or a day later, they were incensed.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"They said, ""Donald Trump is a nice guy. We never said this. The New York Times did false reporting. They’re fake news""",0,1,1,1,0,1
And you know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The New York Times would not report that their story was fake.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"These women said great things. Not only did they not say the bad stuff, they said great things about me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Front page.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And those women — they’re incredible women — they went on television — and they didn’t want to, and I didn’t ask them.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And they said, ""The New York Times made it up. They gave false quotes""",0,0,1,1,0,1
And they went on a lot of shows.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They were really incensed and they couldn’t believe it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s why people know that a lot of the news is fake.,0,0,1,1,0,0
And a lot of the people sitting here are fake.,0,0,1,1,0,1
But 20 percent of them are wonderful.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Okay?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I could just actually ask my question, Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I — you didn’t let me ask my question.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You’ve been asking a question for 10 minutes, all right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, you interrupted my question.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Please sit down. Please.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m asking you —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
— how did those impact your opinions on the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, it does impact my opinion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"I’m a very famous person, unfortunately.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve been a famous person for a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I’ve had a lot of false charges made against me — really false charges.,0,0,1,1,0,0
I know friends that have had false charges.,0,0,1,0,0,0
People want fame.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They want money.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They want whatever.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting home watching television, where they say, ""Oh, Judge Kavanaugh…"" this or that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s happened to me many times.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve had many false charges; I had a woman sitting in an airplane and I attacked her while people were coming onto the plane.,0,1,1,1,0,1
And I have a number-one bestseller out?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I mean it was total phony story.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are many of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when you say, does it affect me in terms of my thinking with respect to Judge Kavanaugh?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because I’ve had it many times.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And if the news would have reported these four people — I couldn’t believe it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"When I heard that they caught these four people, I said, ""Wow. That’s a big story""",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it was — for Fox.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Earlier today and just now, you made a significant allegation against the Chinese government.",0,1,1,1,0,1
You suggested that the Chinese —,0,0,0,0,0,0
I did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
— had meddled in or are meddling in —,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s what I hear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
— the 2018 midterm elections.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s what I hear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What evidence do you have of that, sir?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Is there a national intelligence estimate, for example, that you’re prepared to put forward?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have evidence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have evidence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’ll come out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, I can’t tell you now, but it came — it didn’t come out of nowhere, that I can tell you.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Now, if you — they’ve actually admitted that they’re going after farmers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, I think most of you can cover that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I like that you’re shaking your head, ""yes""",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m going to ask you the next question because of that. Okay?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s probably going to be the killer of all questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me just explain —,0,0,0,0,0,0
But why make the charges now —,0,0,1,0,0,0
"No, no, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"— if you’re not prepared to come forward with the evidence, sir?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"China, now, put on $250 billion, and they’re paying 25 percent on that.",0,1,1,1,0,1
They’re paying billions and billions.,0,1,1,1,0,0
This has never happened to China.,0,0,1,1,0,1
And I like China.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I like President Xi a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think he’s a friend of mine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He may not be a friend of mine anymore, but he — I think he probably respects —",0,0,0,0,0,0
"From what I hear — if you look at Mr. Pillsbury, the leading authority on China — he was on a good show — I won’t mention the name of the show — recently.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And he was saying that China has total respect for Donald Trump and for Donald Trump’s very, very large brain.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said, ""Donald. Donald Trump. They don’t know what to do""",0,1,1,0,0,0
It never happened.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Well, one thing they are trying to do is they are trying to convince people to go against Donald Trump.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"Because a normal, regular, political person that has no concept of what the hell he’s doing would let China continue to take $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuild their country.",1,0,1,1,0,1
"I mean, they were building 29 massive bridges like the George Washington Bridge.",0,1,1,1,0,1
They’re building things that we don’t build anymore.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But we’re starting to build them again.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And our economy now is hotter than it’s ever been. I don’t know you if you saw the confidence levels this morning that just came out.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Fantastic.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in all fairness to the Fed raising rates, they’re raising rates because we’ve never done like we’re doing now.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And one of the things that is nice about the rates — the people that were hurt the worst by these zero interest rates and, you know —",0,0,0,0,0,1
When President Obama had an economy that was — it was the worst comeback since the Great Depression and all that — you’ve all heard that.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"But remember, he was playing with zero-interest money.",0,0,1,0,0,0
He was playing with funny money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s easy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m playing with fairly expensive money.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"So when he does that, the people that benefit are people that actually — in their whole life, they would save 10, 15, 20 percent of their salary and put it in the bank.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Those people got killed because they put their money in the bank.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"They were going to live off the interest, and there was no interest.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, those people are starting to get interest.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And those are the people, frankly, that deserve to — you know, they did a great job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The people that did it right, the people that did the best job got hurt the most.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So in one sense I like it, but basically I’m a low-interest-rate person.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I hate to tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, ma’am.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, you have another meeting tomorrow with Rod Rosenstein.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you planning to fire Rod Rosenstein?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m talking to him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ve had a good talk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He said he never said it.,0,1,1,1,0,0
He said he doesn’t believe it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"He said he has a lot of respect for me, and he was very nice and we’ll see.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And he’s a member of the Trump administration, in that sense; it’s the Justice Department.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I would certainly prefer not doing that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There was no collusion.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"There was no obstruction — I mean, unless you call obstruction the fact that I fight back.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do fight back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I really fight back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, if you call that obstruction, that’s fine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But there’s no obstruction.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There’s no collusion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m going to meet with him tomorrow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I may call Rod tonight or tomorrow and ask for a little bit of a delay to the meeting, because I don’t want to do anything that gets in the way of this very important Supreme Court pick.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I don’t want it competing and hurting the decision — one way or the other decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, I want to hear what she has to say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I want to do — so I may delay that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m going to see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t want to do anything that’s going to conflict with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But my preference would be to keep him, and to let him finish up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I call it a ""witch hunt""",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it is a witch hunt.,0,0,1,0,0,0
If you look at the FBI statements with Strzok and his lover Lisa Page.,0,0,1,0,0,0
If you look at all of the things that have gone on in the FBI.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you look at McCabe taking $700,000 from a Hillary Clinton-PAC essentially run by Terry McAuliffe, who’s her best friend in the world, and he gives them hundreds of thousands of dollars.",1,1,1,1,0,1

"If you look at the horrible statements, like ""Way to go, Page. Great story you put into a newspaper""",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Essentially, now we’ll go and investigate that group.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s terrible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have caught people doing things that are terrible.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I would much prefer keeping Rod Rosenstein.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Much prefer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Many people say I have the right to absolutely fire him.,0,1,0,0,0,0
He said he did not say it.,0,1,0,1,0,0
He said he does not believe that.,0,1,1,0,0,0
And nobody in this room believes it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"By the way, I deal with the people in this room.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was with Mike Pompeo before, and we were dealing, at a very high level, with Japan.",0,1,0,1,0,0

"He said, ""That’s not the 25th Amendment that I’m looking at""",0,1,1,1,0,1
I think I can say that from Mike.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So you don’t think anyone in your administration has ever discussed using the 25th Amendment against you?,0,0,0,1,0,0
I don’t think so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, yeah — enemies, sure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You use anything you can.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Was it in your administration or your Cabinet?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hey, you use anything they can.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re not in love with me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re not going to beat me in the election; they know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re not going to beat me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The people that I’m looking at are total lightweights.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I dream of running against those people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But within your administration?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe they’ll come up with somebody that’s not — they’re not going to beat me.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I’m against what they want to do.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I’m in favor of law enforcement.,0,0,0,0,0,0

They don’t want that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They don’t want that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They don’t want the things that I have.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, I must say, I know many of the Democrats.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They’ll say things and then wink at me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And again, it’s the same old story.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They’ll say things; they don’t mean it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Its politics.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The reason they don’t want me is because they want to run the show.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They want it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s power.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s whatever you want to call it.,0,0,0,0,0,0

She doesn’t want guns.,1,1,0,0,0,0
Take their — let’s see what happens to her.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take their guns away.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’d be very dangerous.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as secretary of State, hide and delete her e-mails, destroy her iPhones — with a hammer!",0,1,1,1,0,0
With a hammer!,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thirteen of them.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"Put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her foundation.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Everything she touched, it just didn’t work out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Certainly it didn’t work out for our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s the same reason why she won’t take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS all over the world.,1,0,1,0,0,0
Her policies have created disaster overseas and poverty at home.,1,1,1,0,0,0
We see it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, we see it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I drove here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We see it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We see it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m running to reverse these failures.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they are incredible failures.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And create a new American future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that future begins with prosperity at home.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My economic agenda can be summed up in three words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you’re going to like these three words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jobs, jobs, jobs.",0,1,0,0,0,0
One of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
African-American communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Democrats have run these inner cities for a half a century, for 60 years, 75 years, even in some cases 100 years straight.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Unabated.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Unbroken.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Over 100 years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They control the mayor’s offices, the school boards, the city councils and the seats in Congress.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime and more failing schools.",0,1,1,1,0,0
Sixty-five percent of African-American children under the age of six now live in poverty.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"More than 3,000 people have been shot in the city of Chicago this year.",0,1,0,1,0,1
This year.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Think of it, since Jan. 1.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working.,1,0,0,1,0,1
Can’t get a job.,1,1,0,0,0,0
These are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And everyone knows that if she’s elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and suffering and crime and heartache.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Amazing people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Amazing country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have an amazing country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And honestly you see the crime statistics.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You’re African-American.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have the inner city problems that have been going on for ever.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Forever.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have problems like nobody has.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you look at crime.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You look at schools.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You look at no jobs.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Look at the worst education.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Look how dangerous.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You can’t walk down the street.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You get shot or your child gets shot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I’ve been saying it, and I’ll say it openly — and some people like it and some people don’t like it, and I don’t really care.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What do you have to lose?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will fix it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m going to fix it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to fix our inner cities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to make them safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to bring jobs back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So to the African-American people within the community, what do you have to lose?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It can’t get — honestly, it can’t get — that’s so nice, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It can’t get any worse.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It can’t get any worse.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It can’t get any worse.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So nice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0

No jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
No education.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Worst education.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"More unsafe — you go to Afghanistan, right.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We hear Afghanistan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I mean we have cities that are far more dangerous than Afghanistan.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Inner cities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
African-American people within that community and outside of that community are going to be voting for Donald Trump in record numbers.,0,0,0,1,0,0
You watch.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to fix it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Her disastrous record speaks for itself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have to tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When she ran for the United States Senate in New York, we have upstate New York which is a total disaster, economic disaster.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"She said she’s going to bring back jobs, jobs, jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"She — anyway, she gets elected.",0,0,0,0,0,0

It got worse.,1,0,0,0,0,0
She didn’t do anything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She didn’t do anything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She went home.,0,0,0,0,0,0

She didn’t do anything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She didn’t do anything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It got worse.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Far worse now, it’s a total catastrophe.",1,0,1,0,0,0
Just remember that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When she tells you about jobs, when she tells you she’s going to fix trade deals, she wouldn’t know where to begin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She wouldn’t know where to begin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And besides that, to do that kind of thing, to negotiate great trade deals, to re-enhance our — I mean look.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our military is so depleted.,0,1,0,0,0,0
We have the greatest people on earth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re using equipment that’s old.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They’re flying planes that are old.,0,1,0,0,0,1
You see what’s happening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s a depleted military.,0,1,0,1,0,0
We have to have a strong military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to take care of our vets.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to take care of our vets.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But to do these things you need a lot of energy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And she does not have the energy.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And in my opinion she is totally unfit to be the president of the United States.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"The only people that she will deliver for, frankly, are her donors and her special interests.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m going to deliver for you, believe me.",0,0,0,0,0,0

My first day in office I’m going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last 10 years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"All needless, job-killing regulations will be immediately canceled.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.,0,1,0,0,0,1
And we’re going to lift the restrictions on American energy — which means at least another half a million jobs each year.,0,1,0,1,0,1
They are being destroyed.,0,1,1,1,0,1
And we’re unable to compete with other nations.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Very simple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that’s just the beginning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Also on my first day I’m going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It has turned out to be a disaster.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This alone will instantly save another two million jobs.,1,1,0,1,0,0
"And if you look at your premiums, it’s through the roof.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, on Nov. 1, just before the election on Nov. 8, new numbers are coming out which will show 40, 50, 60 percent increases.",1,0,0,1,0,1
They want to delay it until after the election because it’s election — it’s a disaster.,1,0,1,0,0,1
It’s a disaster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And your deductibles are so high that unless you lead a really long, slow, vicious death, you’re never going to be able to use it, OK.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Do you see the deductibles?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You’re never going to be able to use it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m also going to completely reform our trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to renegotiate NAFTA.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Probably the worst trade deal ever agreed to, signed in the history of the world, not in the United States.",0,1,1,1,0,1
It’s destroyed our manufacturing in our country.,0,1,1,1,0,1

Not even discussed.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And they had provisions in the agreement, and they would take it out because certain politicians didn’t want to have them in there.",0,0,1,1,0,1

To the Hispanic community I say we are going to protect your jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to build up your schools.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Every single corner.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Unbelievable.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"You have a United States where people from all over the world are looking to come in and invest, and there’s just nothing like what’s happening.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I just want to finish by — I have a group of people that have been so — I have a whole lot of them, so I won’t introduce because then I’ll insult at least half of them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I’ve had a group of people that worked so hard on this and other things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we’re really doing — we had a great first year — so successful in so many different ways.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there’s a tremendous spirit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you look at all of the different charts and polls, and you see, as an example, African American unemployment at the historic low — it’s never had a period of time like this.",1,1,0,1,0,1
Same with Hispanic.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Women at a 17-year low.,1,1,0,0,0,0
It’s very heartwarming to see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But there’s a tremendous spirit in the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would say it’s a spirit like I have never witnessed before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve been here for awhile.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have never witnessed the spirit that our country has right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I just want to thank you all, and all those that are pouring billions of dollars into our country, or ten dollars into our country, we thank you very much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, I will ask you, maybe, a personal question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But before doing so, I’d just like to —",0,0,0,0,0,0
Sounds very interesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn’t know about this one.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I would like to acknowledge the strong presence of your Cabinet members,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
— who tremendously contributed to the discussions the last (inaudible).,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Good, I would like to do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s very nice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Steven, Wilbur, Gary, Robert, even my General and my various other generals, you know.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re making our military protection a little bit better for us too.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Does everybody understand that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you all for being here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now my, maybe personal, question would be: What experience from your past have been most useful in preparing you for the Presidency?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, being a businessman has been a great experience for me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve loved it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve always loved business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’ve always been good at building things, and I’ve always been successful at making money.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’d buy things that would fail –that would be failures — and I’d turn them around and try and get them for the right price, and then I’d turn them around and make them successful.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I’ve been good at it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that takes a certain ability.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, historically, I guess, there’s never really been a businessman or businessperson elected President.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It’s always been a general or a politician.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Throughout history, it’s always been a general — you had to be a general — but mostly it was politicians.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You never have a businessman.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then, in all fairness, I was saying to Klaus last night: Had the opposing party to me won — some of whom you backed, some of the people in the room — instead of being up almost 50 percent — the stock market is up since my election almost 50 percent — rather than that, I believe the stock market from that level, the initial level, would have been down close to 50 percent.",1,1,1,1,0,1
That’s where we were heading.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I really believe that — because they were going to put on massive new regulations.,0,1,1,0,0,1
You couldn’t breathe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was choking our country to death.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And I was able to see that, Klaus, as a businessperson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The other thing is, I’ve always seemed to get, for whatever reason, a disproportionate amount of press or media.",0,0,1,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
Throughout my whole life — somebody will explain someday why — but I’ve always gotten a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
And as businessman I was always treated really well by the press.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The numbers speak and things happen, but I’ve always really had a very good press.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it wasn’t until I became a politician that I realized how nasty, how mean, how vicious, and how fake the press can be.",0,0,1,0,0,0
As the cameras start going off in the background.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"But overall — I mean, the bottom line — somebody said, well, they couldn’t have been that bad because here we are — we’re President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we’re doing a really great job with my team.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have a team of just tremendous people, and I think we’re doing a very special job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I really believe it was time, and it was time to do that job, because I don’t think the United States would have done very well if it went through four or eight more years of regulation and, really, a very anti-business group of people.",0,0,1,0,0,1
We have a very pro-business group.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have regulations cut to a level — in the history of our country, Klaus — this was reported recently.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"In one year we’ve cut more regulations in my administration than any other administration in four, eight, or sixteen years, in the one case.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"We’ve cut more regulations in one year, and we have a ways to go.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I mean, we’re probably 50 percent done.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And we’re going to have regulation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There’s nothing wrong with rules and regulations; you need them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we’ve cut more than any administration ever in the history of our country, and we still have a ways to go.",0,1,0,1,0,0
"So I think between that and the tremendous tax cuts, we’ve really done something.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And one other thing I said — and I saw it last night with some of the leaders and the businesspeople — I think I’ve been a cheerleader for our country, and everybody representing a company or a country has to be a cheerleader, or no matter what you do, it’s just not going to work.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And the reason I’m a cheerleader is because it’s easy — because I love our country and I think we’re just doing really well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we look forward to seeing you in America — special place — and where you are is a special place also.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you all very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I appreciate it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you very much, Mr. President, for being with us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The World Economic Forum community, who is assembled here, will be certainly — and I quote you from the last piece of your remarks — will be certainly among “the hardworking men and women who do their duty each and every day making this world a better place for everyone.”",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much for being with us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much everybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, thank you very much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a great honor to have Nancy Pelosi with us and Chuck Schumer with us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've actually worked very hard on a couple of things that are happening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Criminal justice reform — as you know, we've just heard word — got word that Mitch McConnell and the group, we're going to be putting it up for a vote.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have great Democrat support, great Republican support.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, criminal justice reform, something that people have been trying to get — how long, Nancy?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Many years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Many, many years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Looks like it's going to be passing, hopefully — famous last words — on a very bipartisan way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's really something we're all very proud of.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And again, tremendous support from Republicans and tremendous support from Democrats.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's going to get a very good vote.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we'll see soon enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it will be up for a vote very shortly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot of years they've been waiting for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The other thing, the farm bill is moving along nicely.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I guess they'll be voting on Friday or so.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But pretty close.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Soon.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Soon.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(Inaudible.),0,0,0,0,0,0
And we think the farm bill is in very good shape.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"A lot of good things are happening with it, and our farmers are well taken care of.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And again, that will be quite bipartisan and it will happen pretty soon.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then we have the easy one, the wall.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That will be the one that will be the easiest of all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What do you think, Chuck?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe not?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's called ""funding the government,"" Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
So we're going to see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you, the wall will get built.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll see what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is not an easy situation because the Democrats have a different view, I think, than — I can say — the Republicans.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We have great Republican support.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't have Democrat support.,0,0,1,1,0,1
But we're going to talk about that now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One thing that I do have to say is:,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Tremendous amounts of wall have already been built, and a lot of — a lot of wall.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"When you include the renovation of existing fences and walls, we've renovated a tremendous amount and we've done a lot of work.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"In San Diego, we're building new walls right now.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And we've — right next to San Diego, we've completed a major section of wall and it's really worked well.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So, a lot of wall has been built.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"We don't talk about that, but we might as well start, because it's building — it's being built right now, big sections of wall.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And we will continue that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And one way or the other, it's going to get built.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd like not to see a government closing, a shutdown.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We will see what happens over the next short period of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the wall is a very important thing to us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I might put it a different way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Border security is extremely important, and we have to take care of border security.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you look at what happened with the caravans, with the people, with a lot of — we shut it down; we had no choice.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We shut it down.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But it could be a lot easier if we had real border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just want to pay my respects to the Border Patrol agents and officers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They've been incredible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The ICE agents and officers, they've been incredible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And very importantly, our military.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our military went in and they did an incredible job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They have been really, really spectacular.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A lot of the people that wanted to come into the country, and really, they were to come in no matter how they wanted to come in — they were going to come in even in a rough way — many of these people are leaving now and they're going back to their countries: Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and other countries.",0,1,0,1,0,1
They're leaving.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you noticed, it's getting a lot less crowded in Mexico.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And a lot of them are going to stay in Mexico, and the Mexican government has been working with us very well.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So we appreciate that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But they haven't been coming into our country.,0,1,0,1,0,0
We can't let people come in that way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So that's pretty much it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to talk about the wall.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I wanted to talk about criminal justice reform, just to let you know how positive that is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to talk about the farm bill, how positive that is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I want to talk about the wall.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will tell you, it's a tough issue because we are in very opposite sides of — I really think I can say ""border security,"" but certainly the wall.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But the wall will get built.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot of the wall is built.,1,0,0,1,0,1
It's been very effective.,1,0,0,0,0,0
I asked for a couple of notes on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you look at San Diego, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent once the wall was up.",1,1,0,1,1,1
"El Paso, illegal traffic dropped 72 percent, then ultimately 95 percent, once the wall was up.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"In Tucson, Arizona, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"Yuma, it dropped illegal traffic 95 to 96 percent.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"I mean — and when I say ""dropped,"" the only reason we even have any percentage where people got through is because they walk and go around areas that aren't built.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It dropped virtually 100 percent in the areas where the wall is.,1,1,0,1,0,1
"So, I mean, it's very effective.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If you really want to find out how effective a wall is, just ask Israel — 99.9 percent effective.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And our wall will be every bit as good as that, if not better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So we've done a lot of work on the wall; a lot of wall is built.,0,1,0,1,0,1
A lot of people don't know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot of wall is renovated.,0,1,0,1,0,1
We have walls that were in very bad condition that are now in A1 tip-top shape.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And, frankly, some wall has been reinforced by our military.",0,1,0,1,0,0
Our military has done a fantastic job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So the wall will get built, but we may not — we may not have an agreement today.",0,1,0,0,0,0
We probably won't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have an agreement on other things that are really good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Nancy, would you like to say something?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to meet with you so that we can work together in a bipartisan way to meet the needs of the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think the American people recognize that we must keep government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything, and that you should not have a Trump shutdown.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have the White House —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Did you say ""Trump"" — oh, oh.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A ""Trump shutdown.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have the White House —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was going to call it a ""Pelosi shutdown.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have the Senate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have the House of Representatives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have the votes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You should pass it right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, we don't have the votes, Nancy, because in the Senate, we need 60 votes and we don't have it.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"No, no, but in the House, you could bring it up right now, today.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, but I can't — excuse me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I can't get it passed in the House if it's not going to pass in the Senate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to waste time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the fact is you can get it started that way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The House we can get passed very easily, and we do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, then do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Then do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the problem is the Senate, because we need 10 Democrats to vote, and they won't vote.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"No, no, that's not the point, Mr. President.",0,0,1,0,0,0
The point is —,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's sort of the point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
— that there are equities to be weighed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we are here to have a conversation —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Correct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
— in a careful way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I don't think we should have a debate in front of the press on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the fact is, the House Republicans could bring up this bill, if they had the votes, immediately, and set the tone for what you want.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we thought we were going to get it passed in the Senate, Nancy, we would do it immediately.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We would get it passed very easily in the House.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, that's not the point.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not the point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Nancy, I'd have it passed in two seconds.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It doesn't matter, though, because we can't get it passed in the Senate because we need 10 Democrat votes.",0,0,1,1,0,1
That's the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, again, let us have our conversation —",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
— and then we can meet with the press again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the fact is, is that legislating — which is what we do —",0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"— you begin, you make your point, you state your case.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's what the House Republicans could do, if they had the votes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there are no votes in the House, a majority of votes, for a wall — no matter where you start.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That is exactly right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't have the votes in the House.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them — in one session, it would be done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, then go do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Go do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It doesn't help because we need 10 Democrats in the Senate.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"No, don't put it on the Senate.",0,0,1,1,0,0
Put it on the negotiation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, let me ask you this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Just — and we're doing this in a very friendly manner.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It doesn't help for me to take a vote in the House, where I will win easily with the Republicans —",0,0,0,0,0,0
You will not win.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It doesn't help to take that vote because I'm not going to get the vote of the Senate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, don't blame it on the Senate, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I need 10 senators.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, you have the White House, you have the Senate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have the White House.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have the House of Representatives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The White House is done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the House would give me the vote if I wanted it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I can't because I need —,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you can't — you can't —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Nancy, I need 10 votes from Chuck.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, let me say something here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, let me — let me just say one thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The fact is you do not have the votes in the House.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"Nancy, I do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we need border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let's take the vote and we'll find out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nancy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nancy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's very simple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course we do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"People are pouring into our country, including terrorists.",1,0,1,0,0,0
We have terrorists.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time.,1,0,1,1,0,1
Ten.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These are very serious people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our border agents, all of our law enforcement has been incredible what they've done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we caught 10 terrorists.,1,0,1,1,0,0
These are people that were looking to do harm.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We need the wall.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"We need — more important than anything, we need border security, of which the wall is just a piece.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But it's important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Chuck, did you want to say something?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's what I want to say:,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a lot of disagreements here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios because they say you constantly misstate how much the wall is — how much of the wall is built and how much is there.,0,1,1,0,0,1
But that's not the point here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a disagreement about the wall —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the Washington Post —",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
— whether it's effective or it isn't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not on border security, but on the wall.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We do not want to shut down the government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have called 20 times to shut down the government.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"You say, ""I want to shut down the government.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We want to come to an agreement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we can't come to an agreement, we have solutions that will pass the House and Senate right now, and will not shut down the government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's what we're urging you to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not threaten to shut down the government —,0,0,1,0,0,0
Chuck —,0,0,0,0,0,0
— because you —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You don't want to shut down the government, Chuck.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just finish.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because you can't get your way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because the last time you shut it down you got killed.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me say something, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You just say, ""My way, or we'll shut down the government.""",0,0,1,0,0,0
We have a proposal that Democrats and Republicans will support to do a CR that will not shut down the government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We urge you to take it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if it's not good border security, I won't take it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is good border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is very good border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if it's not good border security, I won't take it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's actually what the border security asked for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's what the border —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because when you look at these numbers of the effectiveness of our border security, and when you look at the job that we're doing with our military —",0,0,0,1,0,0
You just said it is effective.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can I be — can I tell you something?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, you just said it's effective.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Without a wall — these are only areas where you have the walls.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We want to do this —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Where you have walls, Chuck, it's effective.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Where you don't have walls, it is not effective.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait a second.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's call a halt to this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's call a halt to this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've come in here as the first branch of government: Article I, the legislative branch.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We're coming in, in good faith, to negotiate with you about how we can keep the government open.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Open.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to keep it open —,0,0,0,0,0,0
The American —,0,0,0,0,0,0
— if we have border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The American —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we don't have border security, Chuck —",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm with you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
— we're not going to keep it open.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm with you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to have border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's the same border –,0,0,0,0,0,0
Effective border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're bragging about what has been done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
By us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We want to do the same thing we did last year, this year.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's our proposal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If it's good then, it's good now, and it won't shut down the government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Chuck, we can build a much bigger section with more money.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's debate —,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have taken —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's debate in private.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have taken this conversation —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"— to a place that is devoid, frankly, of fact.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we can dispel that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we all agree that we need border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, we do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Is that right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
See?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We get along.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(Inaudible),0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You say border security and the wall.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you have border security without the wall?,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's a commonality on border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, you need the wall.",0,1,0,0,0,0
The wall is a part of border security.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Are you re-defining what it means to have border security?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The wall is a part of border security.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"You can't have very good border security without the wall, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's simply not true.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That is a political promise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Border security is a way to effectively honor our responsibilities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the experts say you can do border security without a wall, which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem.",0,0,1,1,0,1
It totally solves the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, but I don't want to take this —",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's very important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unfortunately, this has spiraled downward from — we came at a place to say, ""How do we meet the needs of American people who have needs?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
The economy has — people are losing their jobs.,1,1,0,1,0,1
The market is in a mood.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Our members are already (inaudible).,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, we have the lowest unemployment that we've had in 50 years.",1,1,0,1,1,1
Sixty people of the Republican Party have lost — are losing their offices now because of the transition.,0,1,1,1,0,1
People are not — the morale is not —,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've gained in the Senate.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Nancy, we've gained in the Senate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The morale —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did we win the Senate?,0,0,0,0,0,0
— is not (inaudible).,0,0,1,0,0,0
We won the Senate.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"When the President brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he's in real trouble.",0,1,1,0,0,0
I did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We did win North Dakota.,0,1,0,1,0,0
This is the most unfortunate thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We came in here in good faith, and we are entering into this kind of a discussion in the public view.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it's not bad, Nancy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let us — no, but it's —",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's called transparency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it's not transparency when we're not stipulating to a set of facts.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And when we wanted to have a debate with you about saying we'd confront some of these facts  —,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"— without saying to the public, ""This isn't true.""",0,0,1,0,0,0
That's what we're going to be talking about: border security.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"If we don't have border security, we'll shut down the government.",0,0,1,0,0,0
This country needs border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We agree with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The wall is a part of border security.,0,0,0,1,0,1
(Inaudible.),0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's have a talk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to get the wall built and we've done a lot of wall already.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"Mr. President, how big a part of border security is the wall?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Is that the —,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a big section.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a big part of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is it everything that you need?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a big part of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to have effective border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need a wall in certain parts — no, not in all parts — but in certain parts of a 2,000-mile border, we need a wall.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"How much money, Mr. President?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We are doing it much under budget.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We're actually way under —,0,0,0,1,0,0
(Inaudible) this conversation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
— budget on the areas that we've renovated and areas that we've built.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I would say if we got —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you still need the —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"— if we got $5 billion, we could do a tremendous chunk of wall.",0,1,1,0,0,0
Is that mandatory?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Would you accept less though?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And are your guests conversely willing to offer more?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we're going to see.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, we have to have the wall.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This isn't a question; this is a national emergency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Drugs are pouring into our country.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"People with tremendous medical difficulty and medical problems are pouring in, and in many — in many cases, it's contagious.",1,0,0,0,0,1
They're pouring into our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to have border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to have a wall as part of border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I don't think we really disagree so much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I also know that, you know, Nancy is in a situation where it's not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I fully understand that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have a good discussion and we're going to see what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. President —,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have to have border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the Leader of the House Democrats who just won a big victory.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Elections have consequences, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just say —,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's why the country is doing so well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me say this:,0,0,0,0,0,0
What the President is representing in terms of his cards over there are not factual.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"We have to have to an evidence-based conversation about what does work, what money has been spent, and how effective it is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This isn't about — this is about the security of our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We take an oath to protect and defend, and we don't want to have that mischaracterized by anyone.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we are —,0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
— that we are —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no I agree with that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
— we are (inaudible).,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So let us have a conversation where we don't have to contradict, in public, the statistics that you put forth but instead can have a conversation about what would really work and what the American people deserve from us at this uncertain time in their lives, where they have apprehension.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The one thing I think we can agree on is we shouldn't shut down the government over a dispute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you want to shut it down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You keep talking about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I — no, no, no, no, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The last time, Chuck, you shut it down —",1,0,0,1,0,0
"No, no, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
— and then you opened it up very quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Twenty times.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Twenty times.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And I don't want to do what you did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, Chuck —",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Twenty times you have called for, ""I will shut down the government if I don't get my wall.""",0,0,0,1,0,0
None of us have said —,0,0,0,0,0,0
You want to know something?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've said it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, you want to put that on my —",0,0,0,0,0,0
You said it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll take it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know what I'll say: Yes, if we don't get what we want, one way or the other — whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you want to call — I will shut down the government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fair enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We disagree.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I am proud — and I'll tell you what —,0,0,0,0,0,0
We disagree.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country.",0,0,1,0,0,0
So I will take the mantle.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will be the one to shut it down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not going to blame you for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The last time you shut it down, it didn't work.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I will take the mantle of shutting down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is (inaudible).,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm going to shut it down for border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we believe you shouldn't shut it down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much everybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(Inaudible) shut down the government.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Chief of Staff?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Have you picked a Chief of Staff, Mr. President?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, we're interviewing a lot of — we have a lot of great people for Chief of Staff.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot of people want the job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot of people want the job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have some great people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot of friends of mine want it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot of people that Chuck and Nancy know very well want it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think people you'd like.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a lot of people that want the job — Chief of Staff.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So we'll be seeing what happens very soon.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're in no rush.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're in no rush.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why no rush, Mr. President?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because we have a wonderful Chief of Staff right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just no — we are in no rush.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Over a period of a week or two, or maybe less, we'll announce who it's going to be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have a lot of people that want the position.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much everybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thanks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You just want massive tax cuts.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That’s what you want.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s the only reason you’re going so wild.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
But it’s wonderful to be back in the great state of Indiana.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What a place.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to thank Senator Todd Young, Senator Joe Donnelly, Representative Jackie Walorski, Representative Susan Brooks, and Representative Mike [sic] Messer for joining us today.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much for being here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Appreciate it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I also want to thank members of my economic team, Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Director Gary Cohn, for joining us, as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We appreciate it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me begin by saying that our hearts and prayers go out to the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands who are suffering in the wake of yet another catastrophic hurricane.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, their island was virtually destroyed.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Federal agencies are working closely with local partners to help these communities get back on their feet as soon as possible.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Texas, Florida, and Louisiana are doing great, and the recovery process is happening very, very quickly.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I will be going down to Puerto Rico next week to get an on-the-ground briefing about the disaster recovery and to see all of our great first responders and to meet a lot of the people who were so affected by these storms.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We are with you now, I tell them, and we will be there every step of the way until this job is done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is truly catastrophic what happened in Puerto Rico.,0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And massive amounts of water, food, and supplies, by the way, are being delivered on an hourly basis.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"It’s something that nobody has ever seen before from this country, I can tell you that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I’m very proud of all of the folks that have worked so hard in FEMA, all of our first responders, all of our police that have gone to the island because their police force has been so badly affected.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And many of their policemen — in fact, most of the police people have lost their homes, and it’s been a tough go.",0,1,0,1,0,1
But we are — we’re going to get it back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Before we go on to discuss the largest tax cut in our county’s history, I also want to provide a brief update on healthcare.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We have the votes on Graham-Cassidy.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"But with the rules of reconciliation, we’re up against a deadline of Friday — two days.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That’s just two days.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And yes-vote senator — we have a wonderful senator, great, great senator — who is a yes vote, but he’s home recovering from a pretty tough situation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And with so many great features, including all of the block granting, the money to the states, et cetera, et cetera, our healthcare plan is really going to be something excellent.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It’s going to be better managed for the people that it serves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Having local healthcare representatives is far better than having healthcare managed from Washington, D.C.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Not even a contest.,0,1,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And many, many governors, as you also see, have agreed with us and approved it and really look forward to running it properly.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But again, because the reconciliation window is about to close, we have to wait a few months until it reopens before we take a vote.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So we’re getting all of the good signs from Alaska and the others to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And I was hoping this would be put on my desk right after we won the election, and I’d come in and sign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it didn’t work that way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There were a couple of people that — I won’t say anything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"But early next year when reconciliation kicks back in, in any event long before the November election, we’re going to have a vote.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we’re going to be able to get that through, and I think we’ll actually get it through very easily and the time makes it easier.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But speaking of reconciliation, the Republican Senate needs to get rid of the filibuster rule, which is blocking so many great legislative reforms the American people badly want and deserve.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"By the way, the Democrats, if they had the opportunity, which hopefully they won’t for many, many years, they would get rid of it on day one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And most of you know exactly what I’m talking about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re here today in Indiana to announce our framework to deliver historic tax relief to the American People.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and I guess it’s probably something I can say that I’m very good at.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve been waiting for this for a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’re going to cut taxes for the middle class, make the tax code simpler and more fair for everyday Americans, and we are going to bring back the jobs and wealth that have left our country — and most people thought left our country for good.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"We want tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and, yes, tax reform that is pro-American.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"It’s time to take care of our people, to rebuild our nation, and to fight for our great American workers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Indiana is a tremendous example of the prosperity that is unleashed when we cut taxes and set free the dreams of our citizens.,0,0,0,0,0,1
This state has claimed a powerful competitive edge built on low taxes and less regulation — and are we cutting regulation?,0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And businesses all across the country have taken notice.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In recent years, Indiana has welcomed dozens of companies fleeing high taxes and high-tax states.",1,1,0,1,0,1
Thousands of new jobs and massive capital investment have followed — meaning a better quality of life for the people of Indiana.,1,0,0,1,0,1
All of this is possible because the people of this state have made a decision. They chose to make Indiana competitive again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They chose, and their choice was so important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It included electing a governor, who you may have heard of",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"— who signed the largest income tax cut in the state’s history, our very, very terrific person and terrific Vice President, Mike Pence.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s time for Washington to learn from the wisdom of Indiana.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need Washington to promote American jobs instead of obstructing them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is what I have been working to achieve every day since I took office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is what I talked about on the campaign trail.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Already, we’re seeing the results of an economic policy that finally puts America first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Unemployment is at a 16-year low.,1,1,0,1,0,1
Unemployment for African Americans is near its lowest point since the turn of the millennium.,1,1,0,1,0,1
It’s really a fantastic thing to see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Wages are rising.,1,1,0,1,0,0
Optimism among manufacturers has reached all-time highs.,0,0,0,1,0,1
GDP growth last quarter reached 3 percent way ahead of schedule; nobody thought that was going to happen for a long time.,1,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And this quarter, I believe, would have been better, but the hurricanes will have an impact.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But other than that, it would have been, in my opinion, even better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your government is working for you once again, not for the donors, not the special interests, but the hardworking taxpaying citizens of our country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
America is back on the right track.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I see so many red hats — Make America Great Again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s what we’re doing — Make America Great Again.,0,0,0,1,0,0

"But our country and our economy cannot take off like they should unless we dramatically reform America’s outdated, complex, and extremely burdensome tax code.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It’s a relic.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ve got to change it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to compete — compete with other countries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The current tax system is a colossal barrier standing in the way of America’s economic comeback because it can be far greater than it’s ever been.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"But we’re going to remove that barrier to create the tax system our people finally, finally, finally — and want and deserve.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For several months, my administration has been working closely with Congress to develop a framework for tax reform.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Over the next few months, the House and Senate will build on this framework and produce legislation that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, and lower taxes for middle-class families — for the working man and woman — and for businesses of all sizes.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I look forward,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I look forward to working with Congress to deliver these historic tax cuts and reforms to the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These tax cuts are significant.,0,0,0,0,0,1
There’s never been tax cuts like what we’re talking about.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Our framework is based on four key ideas:,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, we will cut taxes for the everyday, hardworking Americans — the people that work so long, so hard, and they’ve been forgotten.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But they’re not forgotten anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we proved that on November 8th.,0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under this framework, the first $12,000 of income earned by a single individual will be tax free,",0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"- and a married couple won’t pay a dime in taxes on their first $24,000 of income.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So, a married couple — up to $24,000 — can spend their money on their family, on their children, on what they have to do.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So much better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In other words, more income for more people will be taxed at a rate of zero.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"At this zero percent rate, taxable income will be subject to just three tax rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Jonathan Blanton and his wife Jamie from Greentown are here with us today.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Oh, hello, Jonathan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How are you?,0,0,0,0,0,0

Jonathan does industrial janitorial work and Jamie works at an auto company.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Together they’re raising four beautiful children, and last year they earned less than $90,000.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Under our tax plan they would have saved more than $1,000, and it could be substantially more.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And that’s just on federal taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So they would have saved at least $1,000.",0,1,1,1,0,0
"Middle-income families will save even more money with an increased child tax credit for children under the age of 17, which so many families have been calling for.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
We will eliminate the marriage penalty in the existing credit and expand eligibility to include even more middle-income families.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Greatly expanded.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re also expanding the child tax credit because we believe the most important investment our country can make is in our children.,0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And this is just one more critical way that we’re targeting relief to working families.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In addition, under our framework, those caring for the elderly loved — and we love these people, but we’re caring, and we take such care of the elderly and other adult dependents — will receive financial relief in the form of a $500 tax credit.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re doing everything we can to reduce the tax burden on you and your family.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"By eliminating tax breaks and loopholes, we will ensure that the benefits are focused on the middle class, the working men and women, not the highest-income earners.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our framework includes our explicit commitment that tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected.",1,0,0,1,0,1
They can call me all they want.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s not going to help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m doing the right thing, and it’s not good for me.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Believe me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what is good for me — not only as President and legacy — what is good for me is if everything takes off like a rocket ship, like it should have for 20 years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s good for me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s good for everyone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And that’s what I think is going to happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And a lot of very wealthy people feel the same way, believe me.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"In fact, we are eliminating most itemized deductions that primarily benefit the wealthiest taxpayers.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We’ve also given Congress the flexibility to add an additional top rate on the very highest income earners to provide even more tax relief for working people.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Second, our framework will make the tax code simple, fair, and easy to understand, finally.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Americans waste money.,0,1,1,0,0,0
Americans waste so much money — billions and billions of dollars and many hours each year to comply with our ridiculously complex tax code.,0,1,1,1,0,1
More than 90 percent of Americans use assistance to prepare their taxes.,1,0,0,1,0,1
"Under our framework, the vast majority of families will be able to file their taxes on a single sheet of paper.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are also repealing the alternative minimum tax, or AMT.",0,1,0,1,0,1
About time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
The AMT is actually a shadow tax system that requires many people to calculate their taxes two different ways and pay the higher of the two amounts.,0,1,1,1,0,1
You’re all familiar with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under our framework, the AMT will make even less sense because we are repealing many of the special interest tax breaks that it was designed to deal with.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We are making our taxes simple again.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We are simplifying our tax system.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax.",1,1,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"That means, especially for all of you with small businesses that are really tremendous businesses, you’ll be able to leave them to your family, and your family won’t have to run out and do a fire sale to try and get the money to pay the tax — lose the business, ends up going out of business.",0,0,0,0,0,1
All of those jobs are lost.,0,1,0,1,0,0
The farmers in particular are affected.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"They have wonderful farms, but they can’t pay the tax, so they have to sell the farm.",1,1,0,0,0,1
The people that buy it don’t run it with love.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They can’t run it the same way, and it goes out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So that death tax is a disaster for this country and a disaster for so many small businesses and farmers.,1,1,0,0,0,1
And we’re getting rid of it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now if you don’t like your family, it won’t matter, okay?",0,0,0,0,0,0

Wow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But that great heritage could come to an end because of the death tax, or the estate tax, and could make it impossible for him to pass that legacy to his wonderful family.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We’re not going to let that happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are not going to allow the death tax to steal away the American Dream from these great, great families, many of which are in this room today.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Okay?,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Third, we will cut taxes on American businesses to restore our competitive edge and create more jobs and higher wages for American workers.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"In Indiana, you have seen firsthand that cutting taxes on businesses makes your state more competitive and leads to more jobs and higher paychecks for your workers.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Now, we want to do the same thing for America, making our country more competitive with other nations.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in many cases, those other nations are taking advantage of us in so many ways.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They say they’re friends, and perhaps they are, but believe me, I am renegotiating our trade deals, including NAFTA, including many other trade deals.",0,1,0,1,0,1

"And through regulation, all you have to do is look at the massive pipelines — Dakota Access.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You take a look, 48,000 jobs immediately approved.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So we’re letting that happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in terms of the tax and the tax strategy that Ronald Reagan used to create an economic boom in the 1980s: When our economy took off, the middle class thrived, and the family income of all families was increasing more and more.",0,1,0,1,0,1
And it was a beautiful sight to behold.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Since then, other nations have adopted, unfortunately, our playbook and ran it even better than we did.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And I shouldn’t say even better because we didn’t run it well at all, and we let other nations come in and take advantage of us and take our jobs away and take our businesses out.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And we’re stopping that, and you see it right here what we’ve done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Today, our total business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average foreign competitor in the developed world.",1,1,0,1,0,1
That’s not good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have surrendered our competitive edge to other countries, but we’re not surrendering anymore.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re not surrendering anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under our framework, we will dramatically cut the business tax rate so that American companies and American workers can beat our foreign competitors and start winning again.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
We will reduce the corporate tax rate to no higher than 20 percent.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That’s way down from 35 and 39,0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
which is substantially below the average of other industrialized nations.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"This is a revolutionary change, and the biggest winners will be the everyday American workers as jobs start pouring into our country, as companies start competing for American labor, and as wages start going up at levels that you haven’t seen in many years.",0,0,0,1,0,1

"When our companies move to other countries, it’s our loyal American workers who get hurt.",0,0,0,0,0,1

Members of both parties — it happens to be in the automobile industry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s a good industry.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Members of both parties should agree that we need a tax code that keeps jobs in our country and brings jobs back to our country.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"And for the millions of small businesses and farms that file their taxes as sole proprietors, S corporations or partnerships, we will cap the tax rate they pay at 25 percent — much lower.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Big difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
This will be the lowest top marginal income tax rate for small and mid-size businesses in this country in more than 80 years.,0,1,0,1,0,1

"To give businesses even more reason to boost their investment in America, for the next five years, our framework will allow to fully write off — listen to this — the cost of equipment in the year they buy it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That is big.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And that’s instead of having to take deductions and deduct the cost over a long period of time.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Now that’s called incentive.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s called incentive.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But they’ll only do it if you, the American people, make your voices heard.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Only if you tell Congress to give us a tax code that puts American jobs first.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that’s what we’re doing.,0,0,0,1,0,0

America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration.",1,0,1,1,0,1
It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.,1,1,1,1,0,1
Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border.",0,1,1,1,1,1
More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.,0,1,0,1,0,1

"Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now.",1,1,1,1,0,1
This is a humanitarian crisis — a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States — a dramatic increase.",0,1,1,1,1,1
These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.,0,0,1,0,0,1
One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico.,0,1,1,1,0,1

This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It’s a tremendous problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security.,0,0,0,1,0,1
These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"In fact, safer than ever before.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home.",0,0,0,1,0,1

"At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.",1,0,0,1,0,1
This barrier is absolutely critical to border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s also what our professionals at the border want and need.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is just common sense.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The border wall would very quickly pay for itself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year — vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"The wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.",1,0,0,1,0,1

They changed their mind only after I was elected President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.,0,0,1,1,0,0
The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.,0,0,1,1,0,1
My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and re-opens the government.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have invited Congressional leadership to the White House tomorrow to get this done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Some have suggested a barrier is immoral.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes?",0,0,1,0,0,1
"They don’t build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"America’s heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, who just came across the border.",0,1,1,0,0,1

And many other things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot of positive things are going on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re working on a summit.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And you know all about the summit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It will be in Vietnam — Hanoi.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we will — we’ll be meeting in Hanoi.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ll be meeting in Hanoi.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think a lot of you will be going, I suspect.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I hope we have the same good luck as we had in the first summit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot was done in the first summit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
No more rockets going up.,0,1,0,0,0,0
No more missiles going up.,0,1,0,0,0,0
No more testing of nuclear.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"Get back our remains, the remains of our great heroes from the Korean War.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we got back our hostages.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we hope we’re going to be very much equally as successful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m in no rush for speed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We just don’t want testing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The sanctions, as you know, remain.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Everything is remaining.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"China has been helping us, and Russia has been helping us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And South Korea, I think you can say, has been — we’ve been working very closely with South Korea, with Japan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But China, Russia, on the border, have really been at least partially living up to what they’re supposed to be doing.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And that’s okay — as per the United Nations.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"So we will have a meeting on the 27th and 28th of February, and I think that will be a very successful one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have also established a very good relationship, which has never happened between him or his family and the United States.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They have really taken advantage of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Billions of dollars has been paid to them.,0,1,1,1,0,1
And we won’t let that happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we think that North Korea and Chairman Kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force, economic power.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Their location between South Korea and then Russia and China — right smack in the middle — is phenomenal.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And we think that they have a great chance for tremendous economic prosperity in the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim in Vietnam.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Today, I’m announcing several critical actions that my administration has taken to confront a problem that we have right here at home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away; wars that we should have never been in, in many cases.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But we don’t control our own border.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we’re going to do it one way or the other — we have to do it — not because it was a campaign promise, which it is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was one of many, by the way; not my only one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’re rebuilding the military, our economy is thriving like never before.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"You look at other economies — they’re doing terribly, and we’re doing phenomenally.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"The market is up tremendously today, not that that’s anything, but, you know — because I’ll go back in and they’ll say, ""Oh, the market just went down.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We have all the records.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We have every record.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we’re getting close to that point again where we’ll create new records.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So our country is doing very well, economically.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And we’ve done a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"When you look and when you listen to politicians — in particular, certain Democrats — they say it all comes through the port of entry.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It’s wrong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s wrong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s just a lie.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s all a lie.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They say walls don’t work.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Walls work 100 percent.,1,1,0,1,0,0
"Whether it’s El Paso — I really was smiling, because the other night I was in El Paso — we had a tremendous crowd, and — tremendous crowd.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I asked the people — many of whom were from El Paso, but they came from all over Texas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I asked them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, ""Let me ask you, as a crowd: When the wall went up, was it better?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You were there, some of you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.,1,0,0,1,0,0
You know what they did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But that’s only one example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are so many examples.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall.",1,1,1,1,0,1
And they had 23 murders.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"It’s a lot of murders, but it’s not close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall, in Mexico.",1,1,1,1,0,1
So everyone knows that walls work.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And there are better examples than El Paso, frankly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You just take a look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Almost everywhere.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look at Israel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re building another wall.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me — 99.9 percent.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"That’s what it would be with us, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The only weakness is they go to a wall and then they go around the wall.,0,1,0,0,0,1
They go around the wall and in.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Okay?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s what it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s very simple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And a big majority of the big drugs — the big drug loads — don’t go through ports of entry.,0,1,1,1,0,1
They can’t go through ports of entry.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"You can’t take big loads because you have people — we have some very capable people; the Border Patrol, law enforcement — looking.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You can’t take human traffic — women and girls — you can’t take them through ports of entry.,0,0,1,0,0,1
You can’t have them tied up in the backseat of a car or a truck or a van.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They open the door.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They can’t see three women with tape on their mouth or three women whose hands are tied.,0,1,0,0,0,0
They go through areas where you have no wall.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Everybody knows that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nancy knows it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Chuck knows it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They all know it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s all a big lie.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s a big con game.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You don’t have to be very smart to know: You put up a barrier, the people come in, and that’s it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They can’t do anything unless they walk left or right, and they find an area where there’s no barrier, and they come into the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Welcome.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ve detained more people.,0,1,0,1,0,1
Our border agents are doing such incredible work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our military has been incredible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We put up barbed wire on top of certain old walls that were there.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We fixed the wall and we loaded it up with barbed wire.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It’s very successful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But our military has been fantastic, and I want to thank them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it’s very necessary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ve broken up two caravans that are on their way.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They just are breaking.,0,1,0,0,0,0
They’re in the process of breaking up.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We have another one that we haven’t been able to break up yet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ve been actually working with Mexico much better than ever before.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I want to thank the President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to thank Mexico.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They have their own problems.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They have the largest number of murders that they’ve ever had in their history — almost 40,000 murders.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Forty thousand.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And they got to straighten that out, and I think they will.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I just want to thank the President, because he’s been helping us with these monstrous caravans that have been coming up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We had one that it was up to over 15,000 people.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It’s largely broken up.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Others have gotten through.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, in Tijuana, you have a lot of people staying there.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If we didn’t have the wall up, and if we didn’t have the wall secured and strengthened, they would have walked right through; they’d be welcomed to the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
One of the things we’d save tremendous — just a tremendous amount on would be sending the military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we had a wall, we don’t need the military because we’d have a wall.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I’m going to be signing a national emergency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it’s been signed many times before.,0,0,0,1,0,1
It’s been signed by other Presidents from 1977 or so.,0,0,0,1,0,1
It gave the Presidents the power.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There’s rarely been a problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They sign it; nobody cares.,0,1,1,0,0,0
I guess they weren’t very exciting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But nobody cares.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They sign it for far less important things, in some cases, in many cases.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We’re talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs.",1,1,1,0,0,0
We have some of the greatest people I know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They’ve been with me from the beginning of my campaign — almost from the first week.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Angel Moms.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unfortunately, we have new Angel Moms.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One incredible woman just showed me her daughter who — we’re talking about killed, in the year of ’18.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"I said, ""I haven’t seen you before.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"She said, ""No, I’m new.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, ""That’s too bad.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s too bad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s so sad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Stand up, just for a second.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Show how beautiful your girl was.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have such respect for these people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Angel Moms, Angel Dads, Angel Families.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have great respect for these people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These are great people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These are great people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And the press doesn’t cover them; they don’t want to, incredibly.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And they’re not treated the way they should be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re fighting for other people because they don’t want what happened to their children or husband or anybody.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We have one young lady whose husband — please, stand up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Your husband was just killed in Maryland.,0,1,1,0,0,1
Incredible man.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just killed.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Beautiful children — won’t be seeing their father again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These are brave people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These are people that — they don’t have to be here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They don’t have to be doing this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re doing it for other people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I just want to thank all of you for being here, okay?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I really do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Incredible people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Last year, 70,000 Americans were killed, at least — I think the number is ridiculously low — by drugs, including meth and heroin and cocaine, fentanyl.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And one of the things that I did with President Xi in China, when I met him in Argentina at a summit — before I even started talking about the trade — it was a trade meeting.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It went very well, but before I talked about trade, I talked about something more important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, ""Listen, we have tremendous amounts of fentanyl coming into our country. It kills tens of thousands of people — I think far more than anybody registers. And I’d love you to declare it a lethal drug and put it on your criminal list.""",0,1,1,1,0,1
And their criminal list is much tougher than our criminal list.,0,1,1,0,0,0
Their criminal list — a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called, ""How about a fine?""",0,1,1,0,0,0
"And when I asked President Xi, I said, ""Do you have a drug problem?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, no. I said, ""You have 1.4 billion people. What do you mean you have no drug problem?""",0,1,1,1,0,1
"No, we don’t have a drug problem.  I said, ""Why?"" ""Death penalty. We give death penalty to people that sell drugs.""",0,1,1,1,0,1
End of problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What do we do?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We set up blue ribbon committees.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Lovely men and women — they sit around a table, they have lunch, they eat, they dine, and they waste a lot of time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So if we want to get smart, we can get smart.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You can end the drug problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can end it a lot faster than you think.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But President Xi has agreed to put fentanyl on his list of deadly, deadly drugs.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And it’s a criminal penalty.,0,0,1,1,0,0
And the penalty is death.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So that’s, frankly, one of the things I’m most excited about in our trade deal, if you want to know the truth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think maybe there’s no more important point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to make billions of dollars with this trade deal.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It’s going to be great for our country and great for China, I hope.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Their market is down close to 40 percent.,0,1,0,1,0,1
Our market is way up.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"We’ve picked up, since my election, trillions of dollars of worth.",0,1,0,1,0,1
Trillions.,0,1,0,1,0,0
Many trillions.,0,1,0,0,0,0
And China has lost trillions of dollars.,0,1,1,1,0,1
But I want it to be good for China and I want it to be good for the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we’ll see what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"China is coming here next week, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They’re coming home, the traders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And then China is coming here next week.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And then I’ll be meeting with President Xi at some point after that to maybe — for some remaining deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’ll make them directly, one-on-one, ourselves.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, we’re going to be signing today, and registering, national emergency.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it’s a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it’s unacceptable.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"And by signing the national emergency — something signed many times by other Presidents — many, many times.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"President Obama — in fact, we may be using one of the national emergencies that he signed, having to do with cartels.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Criminal cartels.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It’s a very good emergency that he signed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we’re going to use parts of it in our dealings on cartels.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So that would be a second national emergency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, in that case, it’s already in place.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And what we want — really want to do — is simple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s not like it’s complicated.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s very simple: We want to stop drugs from coming into our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming into our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody has done the job that we’ve ever done.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"I mean, nobody has done the job that we’ve done on the border.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"And in a way, what I did by creating such a great economy — and if the opposing party got in, this economy would be down the tubes.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, I hear a lot of people say, ""Oh, well. But maybe the previous administration…""",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Let me tell you, the previous administration, it was heading south, and it was going fast.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We would have been down the tubes.,0,1,0,0,0,0
The regulations were strangling our country.,0,1,1,0,0,0
Unnecessary regulations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
By creating such a strong economy — you just look at your televisions or see what’s going on today; it’s through the roof.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What happens is more people want to come, so we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we’ve ever had before.",1,0,0,1,0,1
"And we’ve done an incredible job in stopping them, but it’s a massive number of people.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"If we had the wall, it would be very easy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We would make up for the cost of the wall just in the cost of the fact that I would be able to have fewer people.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent, some of whom are sitting in the first row.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We would get — we would get thousands of law enforcement people, including Border Patrol.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You put them in different areas, you have them doing different things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Law enforcement and Border Patrol.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I want to thank law enforcement, and I want to thank Border Patrol, and I want to thank ICE.",0,0,0,0,0,0
ICE is abused by the press and by the Democrats.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"And, by the way, we’re going to be taking care of ICE.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we talk about the new bill.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to be taking care of ICE.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They wanted to get rid of ICE.,0,1,0,1,0,0
And the bill is just the opposite of that.,0,0,0,1,0,0
A lot of good things happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, that’s the story.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We want to have a safe country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I ran on a very simple slogan: ""Make America Great Again.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you’re going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you’re going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don’t have a barrier, then very hard to make America great again.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"But we’ve done a fantastic job, but we haven’t been given the equipment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We haven’t been given the walls.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"And in the bill, by the way, they didn’t even fight us on most of the stuff.",0,0,1,1,0,0
Ports of entry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have so much money, we don’t know what to do with it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t know what to do with all the money they’re giving us.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It’s crazy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The only place they don’t want to give as much money — $1,375,000,000.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Sounds like a lot, but it’s not so much, although we’re putting it to much better use than it used to be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A lot of the past administrations, they had — it was easy to get, and they didn’t build or they didn’t do what they could have done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It would have been great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It would have been great to have done it earlier, but I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People that should have stepped up did not step up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They didn’t step up, and they should have.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Would have been easy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not that easy, but it would have been a lot easier.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But some people didn’t step up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we’re stepping up now.,0,0,0,1,0,0
So we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Whether it’s $8 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion, it’s going to build a lot of wall.",0,1,1,0,0,1
We’re getting it done.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We’re right now in construction with wall in some of the most important areas.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall, making it just as good as new.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That’s where a lot of the money has been spent — on renovation.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"In fact, we were restricted to renovating, which is okay.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But we’re going to run out of areas that we can renovate pretty soon.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So — and we need new wall.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I want to thank everybody for being here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to thank, in particular, the Angel Moms and Dads for being here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have great respect for you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The real country, our real country — the people that really love our country, they love you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I just want you to know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know how hard you fight and I know how hard a fight you’re having.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I also want to thank all of the law enforcement for the job you do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Believe me, our country loves you and they respect you greatly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we’re giving you a lot of surplus.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"We’re giving you surplus military equipment, which a lot of people didn’t like giving, previous to this administration.",0,0,1,1,0,1
But hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus equipment.,0,1,1,1,1,1
"And as we get it, as you know, we send it down.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you have much better protection.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But I really appreciate you being here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So the order is signed.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And I’ll sign the final papers as soon as I get into the Oval Office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we will have a national emergency, and then we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, even though it shouldn’t be there.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we’ll get another bad ruling.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And then we’ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we’ll get a fair shake.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we’ll win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They sued us in the Ninth Circuit, and we lost, and then we lost in the appellate division, and then we went to the Supreme Court, and we won.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And it was very interesting, because yesterday they were talking about the ban.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because we have a ban.,0,0,0,1,0,0
It’s very helpful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Madam Secretary, is that right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Without the ban, we’d have a bigger problem.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We have a ban on certain areas, certain countries, depending on what’s going on in the world.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And we won.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"But somebody said, ""President Trump lost on the ban.""",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, he was right; I lost at the lower court.",0,1,1,0,0,0
He — he didn’t say that we ultimately won at the United States Supreme Court.,0,0,0,1,0,1
They didn’t want to say that.,0,1,0,0,0,0
They didn’t want to go that far.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They were saying how I lost.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The person sitting right up here — ""Donald Trump lost on the ban.""",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Yeah, I did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then I lost a second time; you should have said that, too.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And then it went to the Supreme Court and I won.,0,1,0,1,0,0
Didn’t want to take it that far.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we won on the ban and we won on other things, too.",0,1,0,1,0,0
"The probably easiest one to win is on declaring a national emergency, because we’re declaring it for virtual invasion purposes: drugs, traffickers, and gangs.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And one of the things, just to finish: We have removed thousands of MS-13 gang monsters.",0,1,0,1,0,1
Thousands.,0,1,0,0,1,0
They’re out of this country.,0,1,0,0,0,0
We take them out by the thousands.,0,1,0,1,0,0
And they are monsters.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you have any questions?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"John, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. President — (inaudible).,0,0,0,0,0,0
"AIDE:  Yes, we do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There you go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You were prepared.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, a lot of the money —",0,0,0,1,0,0
Were you saying I was prepared?,0,0,0,0,0,0
With the microphone and prepared for questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, I thought you meant I was prepared.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I couldn’t believe you said that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
People don’t like saying that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You were prepared for questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am prepared.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m always prepared.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot of the money that goes to count toward your $8 billion is money that’s being reprogrammed in the DOD budget.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"How can you guarantee to military families and to our men and women of the military that none of the money that would be reprogrammed to a wall will take away from other technology, other renovations, construction that is desperately needed in our military?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, John, we had certain funds that are being used at the discretion of generals, at the discretion of the military.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Some of them haven’t been allocated yet, and some of the generals think that this is more important.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I was speaking to a couple of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They think this is far more important than what they were going to use it for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, ""What were you going to use it for?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I won’t go into details, but it didn’t sound too important to me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Plus, if you think, I’ve gotten $700 billion for the military in year one, and then last year, $716 billion.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"And we’re rebuilding our military, but we have a lot.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And under the previous administration, our military was depleted — badly depleted.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And they weren’t spending — I mean, they had a much less — they had a much smaller amount of money.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"So when I got $700 billion, and then $716 billion — and this year, it’s going to be pretty big too, because there’s few things more important than our military.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"You know, I’m a big deficit believer and all of that, but before we really start focusing on certain things, we have to build up our military.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It was very badly depleted.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"And we’re buying all new jetfighters, all new missiles, all new defensive equipment.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We have — we’ll soon have a military like we’ve never had before.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"But when you think about the kind of numbers you’re talking about — so you have $700 billion, $716 billion — when I need $2 billion, $3 billion of out that for a wall — which is a very important instrument, very important for the military because of the drugs that pour in.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And as you know, we have specific rules and regulations where they have drugs, and what you can do in order to stop drugs.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And that’s part of it, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re taking a lot of money from that realm also.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"But when you have that kind of money going into the military, this is a very, very small amount that we’re asking for.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
ABC.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not NBC.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I like ABC a little bit more — not much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Come on, ABC.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Not much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Pretty close.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, what do you say to those, including some of your Republican allies, who say that you are violating the Constitution with this move and setting a bad precedent that will be abused by possibly Democratic Presidents in the future?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Marco Rubio has made this point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, not too many people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not too many people have said that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the courts will determine that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I expect to be sued.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I shouldn’t be sued.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Very rarely do you get sued when you do national emergency.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And then other people say, ""Oh, if you use it for this, now what are we using it for?""",0,0,1,0,0,0
We got to get rid of drugs and gangs and people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s an invasion.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country that we stop, but it’s very hard to stop.",1,0,1,1,0,1
"With a wall, it would be very easy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I think that we will be very successful in court.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it’s clear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the people that say we create precedent — well, what do you have?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Fifty-six?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are a lot of times — well, that’s creating precedent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And many of those are far less important than having a border.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you don’t have a border, you don’t have a country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we fight — before I got here — we fight all over the world to create borders for countries, but we don’t create a border for our own country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So I think what will happen is, sadly, we’ll be sued, and sadly, it’ll go through a process.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And, happily, we’ll win — I think.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let’s go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let’s hear it, NBC.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Come on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I just want to say, in the past, when President Obama tried to use executive action as it related to immigration, you said, ""The whole concept of executive order, it’s not the way the country is supposed to be run.""",0,0,0,1,0,1
"You said, ""You’re supposed to go through Congress and make a deal.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Will you concede that you were unable to make the deal that you had promised in the past, and that the deal you’re ending up with now from Congress is less than what you could have had before a 35-day shutdown?",0,0,1,1,0,1
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I went through Congress.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I made a deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I got almost $1.4 billion when I wasn’t supposed to get one dollar — not one dollar.,0,0,1,1,0,0
He’s not going to get one dollar.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Well, I got $1.4 billion.",0,1,0,1,0,1
But I’m not happy with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I also got billions and billions of dollars for other things — port of entries, lots of different things.",0,1,0,1,0,0
The purchase of drug equipment.,0,1,0,0,0,0
More than we were even requesting.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"In fact, the primary fight was on the wall.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Everything else, we have so much, as I said, I don’t know what to do with it we have so much money.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But on the wall, they skimped.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"So I did — I was successful, in that sense, but I want to do it faster.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I could do the wall over a longer period of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn’t need to do this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I’d rather do it much faster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I don’t have to do it for the election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’ve already done a lot of wall, for the election — 2020.",1,0,0,1,0,0
"And the only reason we’re up here talking about this is because of the election, because they want to try and win an election, which it looks like they’re not going to be able to do.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And this is one of the ways they think they can possibly win, is by obstruction and a lot of other nonsense.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I think that I just want to get it done faster, that’s all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, ma’am, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Roberta Rampton from Reuters.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I wanted to ask about China.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you feel that enough progress has been made in the talks to head off the increase in tariffs scheduled for March 1?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you know, you’re talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tariffs, okay?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I mean, we’re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And our steel industry now, as an example, we tax dumped steel — much of it comes from China — at 25 percent.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Our steel industry is so vibrant now again, they’re building plants all over the United States.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It’s a beautiful thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And from a defensive standpoint, and from any standpoint, you need steel.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, you can do without certain industries.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our country cannot do without steel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I love tariffs, but I also love them to negotiate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And right now, China is paying us billions of dollars a year in tariffs.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And I haven’t even started.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, here’s the thing: If we make a deal, they won’t have to pay.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, it’ll be a whole different story.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They won’t be paying that, but we’ll have a fair deal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There won’t be intellectual property theft.,0,0,1,0,0,1
There won’t be so many other things that have gone on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And no other President has done this.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"No other — you know, we didn’t have a deal with China.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"You had the WTO, one of the worst trade deals ever made — probably even worse than NAFTA, if that’s believable, which, you know, hard to believe, because I think NAFTA was just a disaster.",0,1,1,1,0,1
It was a total disaster for our country.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And now we made the USMCA, which is going to be a terrific — a great deal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, by the way, the USMCA, from Mexico — that’s United States, Mexico, Canada — that’s where the money is coming from, not directly but indirectly, for the wall.",1,0,0,1,0,1
And nobody wants to talk about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because we’re saving billions and billions of dollars a year, if Congress approves that deal.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Now, they might now want to approve a deal just because they’ll say — one of the things I’m thinking of doing — this has never been done before: No matter how good a deal I make with China, if they sell me Beijing for one dollar, if they give me 50 percent of their land and every ship that they’ve built over the last two years — which is a lot — and they give them to me free, the Democrats will say, ""What a lousy deal; that’s a terrible deal.""",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Like, ZTE, I got a billion — more than a billion-dollar penalty in a short period of time.",0,1,1,1,0,1

"When I made that deal, I said, ""This is incredible.""",0,1,0,0,0,0
"I just got — I got over a billion-dollar penalty, plus they had to change their board of directors.",0,1,1,1,0,1
They had to change their top management.,0,1,1,0,0,0
But they had to pay over a billion dollars.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"I said, ""What a deal.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
It took like a week.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the Democrats didn’t even know there was a problem with ZTE.,0,1,1,1,0,1
I’m the one that find them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m the one that settled it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Over a billion dollars.,0,1,1,1,0,1
And President Xi called me and he said it would be important to him if they could get a deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And we’ll all go down together, and what we’ll do is we’ll negotiate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ll put them in the room and let them speak up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because any deal I make with China, if it’s the great — it’s going to be better than any deal that anybody ever dreamt possible, or I’m not going to have a deal.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It’s a very simple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But any deal I make with China, Schumer is going to stand up and say, ""Oh, it should’ve been better. It should’ve been better."" ",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s not acceptable to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I’m thinking about doing something very different.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t think it’s ever been — I just don’t want to be second-guessed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But that’s not even second-guess; that’s called politics.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Sadly, I’d probably do the same thing to them, okay?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But any deal I make toward the end, I’m going to bring Schumer — at least offer him — and Pelosi.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Speaker Ryan.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What difference does it make?,0,0,0,0,0,0

You know what happened on the West Side Highway.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Senator Christie, you began this campaign touting your record as a Republican from a blue state who knows how to get things done and reach across the aisle.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"However, many Republicans feel that reaching across the aisle and getting things done isn't great if you get the wrong things done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they prefer to stand on principle rather than compromise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why are they wrong and you're right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're not wrong.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But what's wrong is your premise in the question.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You can do both.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration.",0,0,0,1,0,1
He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And who's compromised and who is principled.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What he wants is something to get done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.,0,0,1,1,0,1
Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Paul, you are definitely not in the establishment category.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But at the beginning of this campaign, you said you were your own man when asked about your father, former Texas Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Cruz's campaign is out with a video saying that Cruz is the intellectual and political heir to your father's 2012 campaign and the liberty movement.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And your father now says it's realistic that Donald Trump will be your party's nominee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So did you make a mistake by not fully -- more fully embracing your father politically at the beginning of this campaign?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I've always had a great deal of respect.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Ted didn't show up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up.",0,0,0,1,0,0
He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.,0,0,1,1,0,0
And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The NSA is another big issue.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records.",0,1,1,1,0,1
I don't think Ted can have it both ways.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we don't see it happening at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Cruz, your response to that?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It didn't have the votes to pass.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Rubio?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He believes everything he stands for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I do respect Rand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I want to be frank about what I stand for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS.",0,0,1,0,0,0
That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe.",0,1,1,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
May I respond?,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll come back to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I mean, I was talked about in the question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK. Go ahead, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just very quickly, I would like to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy did not stop one terrorist attack.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I don't think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we look at this bulk collection, the court has looked at this.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Even the court declared it to be illegal.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"If we want to collect the records of terrorists, let's do it the old fashioned way.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Let's use the Fourth Amendment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's put a name on a warrant, let's ask a judge for it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's respect the history of our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
John Adams said that we fought a War for Independence because we wanted to fight against generalized warrants.,0,1,0,1,0,1
Let's don't forget that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Kasich, I want to get back to this question of where conservatives are this year.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You call yourself a, quote, ""inside-outside guy, a reformer who knows how to get things done,"" but you reject the establishment label.",0,0,0,0,0,0
First question is why do you reject it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And secondly, what do you say to Republican voters this year who view practical government experience as a liability and not an asset?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"You know, the situation is this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to come together as a country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have to stop all the divisions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And it isn't because I'm all that great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'll keep -- I'll keep heading in that direction, believe me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dr. Carson, I want to pick up on that with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor Kasich likes to say he knows how to land the plane.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You've landed a lot of planes in the O.R.,0,1,0,1,0,1
But what about the idea of running for president with no experience in government at all?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I will gladly confess that I'm the only one on this stage with no political title.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're not going to hear a lot of polished political speech from me, but you will hear the truth.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"In fact, sometimes it's not that way...",0,0,0,0,0,0

"... and I've had more two a.m. phone calls than everybody here put together, making life and death decisions, put together very complex teams to accomplish things that have never been done before.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we are in a situation right now in our country that we have never been in before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need people who think out of the box and can solve problems; can utilize the resources around them; very smart people, to focus on the problem and solve the problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The American people are terrified.,0,0,1,0,0,1
That's why we have this abnormal situation going on right now.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We don't need more of the same solutions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need different solutions to solve the problems and to save our nation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentlemen, we're now going to start to drill down into specific issues that are on voters' minds.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to start with one of the biggest ones, which is foreign terror.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"According to Google, ISIS was by far the most searched foreign policy topic over the last year.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Senator Cruz, you talk tough about fighting terrorism.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You talk about carpet bombing into oblivion.,0,1,1,0,0,0
You talk about seeing if the sand will glow at night.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But critics say that your record does not match up to that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You opposed giving President Obama authority to enforce his red line in Syria.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Three years in a row now, you have voted against the Defense Authorization Act.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"How do you square your rhetoric with your record, sir?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Chris, I will apologize to nobody for the vigorousness with which I will fight terrorism, go after ISIS, hunt them down wherever they are, and utterly and completely destroy ISIS.",0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, you claim it is tough talk to discuss carpet bombing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It is not tough talk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is a different, fundamental military strategy than what we've seen from Barack Obama.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Barack Obama right now, number one, over seven years, has dramatically degraded our military.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"You know, just two weeks ago was the 25th anniversary of the first Persian Gulf war.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"When that war began, we had 8,000 planes.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Today, we have about 4,000.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"When that war began, we had 529 ships.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Today, we have 272.",0,0,0,1,0,1
You want to know what carpet bombing is?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's what we did in the first Persian Gulf war; 1,100 air attacks a day, saturation bombing that utterly destroyed the enemy.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Right now, Barack Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.",0,1,0,1,0,1
He's not arming the Kurds.,0,1,1,1,0,0
We need to define the enemy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to rebuild the military to defeat the enemy.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Senator Rubio, does Senator Cruz's record match his rhetoric?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, again, I mean, obviously, as already has been pointed out, the only budget that Ted has ever voted for is a budget that Rand Paul sponsored that brags about cutting defense spending.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And I think that's a bad idea for the following reason.,0,0,0,0,0,0
ISIS is the most dangerous jihadist group in the history of mankind.,0,0,1,1,0,1
ISIS is now found in affiliates in over a dozen countries.,0,0,1,1,0,1
ISIS is a group that burns people alive in cages; that sells off little girls as brides.,0,1,1,1,0,1
ISIS is a group that wants to trigger an apocalyptic showdown in the city of Dabiq -- not the city of Dubuque; I mis-said -- mis-said that wrong once (inaudible) time -- the city of Dabiq in Syria.,0,1,1,1,0,1
They want to trigger an apocalyptic Armageddon showdown.,0,1,1,0,0,0
This group needs to be confronted and defeated.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They are not going to go away on their own.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're not going to turn into stockbrokers overnight or open up a chain of car washes.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"They need to be defeated militarily, and that will take overwhelming U.S. force.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"Today, we are on pace to have the smallest Army since the end of World War II, the smallest Navy in 100 years, the smallest Air Force in our history.",0,1,0,1,0,1
You cannot destroy ISIS with a military that's being diminished.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"When I'm president, we are rebuilding the U.S. military because the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest military in the world.",0,0,0,1,0,1

"Chris, in 1981, when Ronald Reagan came to the Oval Office, he encountered a military that had been debilitated just as the current military has, just like Jimmy Carter weakened our readiness, undermined our ability to defend this country, so too has Barack Obama.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Just as morale in the military has plummeted in the last seven, so it had then.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"What Reagan did is he began with tax reform and regulatory reform, unleashing the engine of the American free enterprise system.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It brought booming economic growth and that growth fueled rebuilding the military.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I intend to do the exact same thing to defeat radical Islamic terrorism --,0,0,1,0,0,0

Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Christie, you have compared both Senators Cruz and Rubio to Barack Obama, saying that we cannot afford another inexperienced President.",0,0,1,0,0,0
You've also said that Senator Cruz's vote to curtail the NSA surveillance program made America less safe.,0,0,1,1,0,1
Is either of them ready to be Commander in Chief?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me say that I do believe that the vote on NSA made the country less safe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me tell you what the country should really be worried about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I watched that town hall meeting with the Democrats the other night, and I heard Hillary Clinton asked a direct question by an Iowan, and that's what Iowans like to do.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They like to ask direct questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, they asked about her email situation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, here's what she said to the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She did it for convenience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
For her convenience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She put America's secrets at risk for her convenience.,0,0,0,1,0,0
She put American intelligence officers at risk for her convenience.,0,0,1,1,0,0
She put American strategy at risk for her convenience.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Let me tell you who's not qualified to be President of the United States, Chris.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Hillary Rodham Clinton did that to our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"You criticized several candidates in this field on this stage for what you call unrealistic ideas about how to fight terrorists, including Rubio, and Cruz on the issue of their refusing to give the President authority to enforce the redline in Syria.",0,0,1,1,0,1

They should have made it more open ended for the next president.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster.",1,1,0,0,0,1

"It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable.",0,0,0,0,0,1

Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think that is the -- I think that's the conservative consensus pragmatic approach to how to solve this problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
May I respond?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Go ahead, senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's interesting that Jeb mentions the book.,0,0,0,0,0,0

There's not going to be consensus on this issue until we enforce our immigration laws.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That is abundantly clear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're not going to be able to ram down the throat of the American people your approach.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The only way we're are going to be able to move forward after two migratory crises with minor, after two unconstitutional executive orders, the only way forward on this issue is to first bring illegal immigration under control.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"I feel like I need -- I feel like I need a Washington to English dictionary converter, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, I heard what they both said, I saw it on the video.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And the fact is this is what makes a difference when you're a governor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can change your mind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ted can change his mind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Marco can change his mind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's perfectly legal in this country to change your mind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when you're a governor, you have to admit it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You can't hide behind parliamentary tricks.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"That's the difference, and that's the kind of leader we need in the White House.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Stop the Washington bull and let's get things done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's go to a Youtube question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's get to a Youtube question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a question from a Youtube creator with over 2 million subscribers.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Watch.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm Dulce Candy, a Youtube creator who immigrated to the United States from Mexico when I was a little girl.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Since then, I am proud to say I served in the armed forces in Iraq, became a citizen and I am now an entrepreneur.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"There are many immigrants who contribute positively to the American economy, but some of the comments in the campaign make us question our place in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If America does not seem like a welcoming place for immigrant entrepreneurs, will the American economy suffer?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dr. Carson, that's one -- that one's for you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, great.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"As I said before, we are a land of immigrants, but we have to be intelligent about the way that we form our immigration policies, and that's one of the reasons that I have called on us to declare war on the Islamic State because we need to reorient our immigration policies and our visa policies for people who are coming into this country because there are many people out there who want to destroy us.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Now, I recognize that the vast majority of people coming in here probably are not those kinds of people, but that's not good enough.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you've got 10 people coming to your house and you know one of them is a terrorist, you're probably going to keep them all out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we probably have to figure out a way to make sure that we keep America safe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Can I -- can I -- I just...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That beautiful young woman who's an entrepreneur who served in the military, first of all, is deserving of our respect for service in the military and the fact that she's an entrepreneur.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And we should be a welcoming nation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our identity is not based on race or ethnicity, it's based on a set of shared values.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's American citizenship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Dulce Candy -- a pretty cool name, actually -- that is now an entrepreneur over Youtube is part of that American spirit, and we should celebrate it as conservatives.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's what we believe in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can -- you can deal with the threat of terror and also recognize that this country should be aspirational across the board.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that's the false choice...,0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... that's the -- that's the false choice in this whole debate about immigration.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Of course, we're going to be a nation of immigrants.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"By the way, no nation on earth is more generous than America is.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Every single year close to a million people emigrate to the United States legally.,0,0,0,1,0,1
There's no nation on earth that comes close to that number.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think the only argument is are we a sovereign country, are we not allowed to choose who comes in, when they come in and how they come in?",0,0,0,0,0,1
And that's not what's happening now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think the other problem is we have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And we will always celebrate legal immigration like Dulce's great story.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're moving on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentlemen, we're going to turn now to what we call electability, issues that you're either facing in the primaries or issues that you're certainly going to face in a general election.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So you may not be altogether unhappy if you're not included in this round.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Cruz, you pride yourself on standing up to the D.C. cartel, but as we've seen to a certain degree tonight, there's a price for standing up to the D.C. cartel.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thirteen Republican senators have endorsed other candidates, none have endorsed you.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"You -- twice last year, you asked for a colleague to second a motion, a routine courtesy on the Senate floor, and no senator would do it.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Top GOP officials worry that if you're at the top of the ticket -- some officials -- that not only will you lose the White House, but it will tank the ticket all the way down the line.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"The question is does your style sometimes get in the way of your ability to get things done, sir?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Chris, you are exactly right that I am not the candidate of career politicians in Washington.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'll tell you the endorsements that I am proud of are the over 200,000 volunteers across this country who have signed up to volunteer for our campaign.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"The endorsements that I am proud of are leading conservatives like Iowa's own Congressman Steve King, who is a national co-chairman of my campaign.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"The endorsements that I'm proud of are conservative leaders like Dr. James Dobson, and over 700,000 contributions nationwide, people going to our Web site, tedcruz.org.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"This is a grassroots campaign and, you know, when I ran for senate in Texas, I told the people of Texas that I'm not going there to go along to get along.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Washington is broken.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"tell the truth, and do what I said I would do.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor bush, poll after poll shows you running among the worst in your party against Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Even Mitt Romney said that a Bush v. Clinton head-to-head would be too easy for the Democrats.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Yet still you and the super PACs supporting you continue to blanket the airwaves with cutting ads, not against Mrs. Clinton, but against your fellow Republicans, especially Senator Rubio.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do these attacks do more harm than good by targeting those candidates who appear to have the best chance of defeating Mrs. Clinton?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I've seen polls where I'm beating Hillary Clinton pretty regularly.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And I believe I can, because I have a proven record, a record of accomplishment, a record of cutting taxes, of shrinking the government, of reforming education, of challenging the status quo, eliminating career civil service protections, shrinking the government workforce by 11 percent, but leading the nation in job growth.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I'm confident if I win this nomination, I will aggressively go against her and beat her.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As it relates to the super PACs, I have no control over that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And this is beanbag compared to what the Clinton hit machine is going to do to the Republican nominee.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The simple fact is, we all have a record.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It all will be scrutinized.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's give and take.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's called the politics.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the way it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm running hard and I believe I'll be the Republican nominee and I'll be the one best suited to beat Hillary Clinton, who should not be president of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio, first before I ask you a question, any response to Governor Bush?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I believe, and I know that if Iowa helps make me the Republican nominee, I will defeat Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary doesn't want to run against me, but I cannot wait to run against her.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I cannot wait to earn the opportunity to do it because she cannot be the president of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.,1,1,0,0,0,0
She said that here in Iowa just two days ago.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That would be a disaster for this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I hope and pray and cannot wait until this state and others give me an opportunity to serve this party as its nominee because I will defeat Hillary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now let's talk about electability, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"TIME magazine once called you ""the Republican savior.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
Rush Limbaugh and others said you likely will be president some day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if you look at the recent average of polls in your home state of Florida, you're in third trailing Donald trump by 24 points.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"If the people who know you best have you there, why should the rest of the country elect you?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me be clear about one thing, there's only one savior and it's not me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's Jesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.,0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And so -- and I've always made that clear about that cover story.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as the polls are concerned, Iowa, on Monday night you're going to go to a caucus site and you'll be the first Americans that vote in this election.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You will be the first Americans that get to answer the fundamental question, what comes next for this country after seven disastrous years of Barack Obama?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And let me tell you what the answer better not be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It better not be Bernie Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Bernie Sanders is a socialist.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I think Bernie Sanders is good candidate for president of Sweden.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't want to be Sweden.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We want to be the United States of America.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being the commander-in-chief of the United States.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"In fact, one of her first acts as president may very well be to pardon herself because Hillary Clinton...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton stored classified information on her private server.,0,0,1,1,0,1
And Hillary Clinton lied to the families of those four brave Americans who lost their life in Benghazi.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And anyone who lies to the families of Americans who have died in the service of this country can never be commander-in-chief of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Christie, two of your former top aides go on trial in May for fraud and conspiracy in the ""Bridge-gate"" case, the politically motivated closure of lanes to the George Washington Bridge.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Another former aide who has already pleaded guilty and will likely testify for the government, as you know, says that you knew about this whole deal.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"Can the GOP take the chance of nominating you with this scandal still out there, sir?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sure, because there has been three different investigations and proven that I knew nothing.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"And the fact is that what I did do, what I did do from the beginning, Chris, as soon as I found out about it, I fired the people who were responsible.",0,1,0,1,0,0
And that's what you expect from a leader.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, I'll tell you something else.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I inherited a state in New Jersey that was downtrodden, and beaten by liberal democratic policies, high taxation, high regulation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, this year, in 2015, New Jersey's had the best year of job growth that our state has ever had in the last 15 years.",0,1,0,1,0,1
That's because we've put conservative policies in place.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, I'll tell you one other thing, you know why the Republican party will want to take a chance on me?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Because they know that Hillary Clinton will never be prosecuted by this justice department, and they're going to want to put a former federal prosecutor on the stage to prosecute her next September.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And, there is no one on this stage better prepared to prosecute the case against Hillary Clinton than I am.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I will be ready.,0,0,0,0,0,0

(COMMERCIAL BREAK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Welcome back, everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's get back to the questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Chris?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentlemen, almost 60% of Republican caucus-goers identify themselves as Evangelicals, so I'd like to spend a few minutes exploring social issues.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Governor Kasich, you talk a good deal about your faith.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, you say it played a role in your decision to expand Medicaid, and you say that when you meet Saint Peter at the Pearly Gates, he's going to ask what you did for the poor, not what you did to keep government small.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Senator Cruz is on the opposite side of this issue from you, so does that mean that you're getting in and he isn't?",0,0,1,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.,0,0,1,0,0,1
How has it worked?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent.",1,1,0,1,1,1
That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The mentally ill?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In terms of my faith, look, all I say is that when I study scripture, I know that people who live in the shadows need to have a chance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But what -- I will tell you this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Because we don't want them in and out -- we don't want them in and out of the prisons.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Give people a chance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We talked about criminal justice reform.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've enacted it in our state.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is what we have done in Ohio.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're running surpluses.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"We're up 400,000 jobs.",0,1,0,1,0,1
And guess what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The formula is working.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I'd suggest people take a look at it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentlemen, we had a case study on religious liberty just this last summer.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A county clerk in Kentucky named Kim Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court ruling, saying that it violated her religious beliefs.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Governor Christie, you said that she must follow the law or be moved to another job that would be in keeping with her conscience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But some conservatives say that that violates her religious liberty.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that someone in that office has to do their job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.,0,1,1,1,0,0
But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As a Catholic, that's what I want to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio, during the last debate, you said Governor Christie had changed his position and his mind on gun control, on common core, and backing President Obama's nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"He said you're wrong on the facts and you can't, quote, ""slime your way to the White House.""",0,0,1,1,0,0
"I assume in the last two weeks, you've done some fact-checking.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you want to take anything back?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, I would encourage people to go on my website, marcorubio.com, and we'll put all the facts up there so people can see it for themselves.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think this is an important question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You see, why are we one of the most generous people in the world -- no, the most generous people in the world?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is not because of the tax writeoff.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor.",0,0,0,0,0,1
This is what's made our nation so special.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when I'm president, I can tell you this, my faith will not just influence the way I'll govern as president, it will influence the way I live my life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because in the end, my goal is not simply to live on this earth for 80 years, but to live an eternity with my creator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will always allow my faith to influence everything I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Paul, in May on the campaign trail you, said you didn't get into politics to fight about abortion.",0,0,0,1,0,1
You said you were more concerned about the national debt.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Your answer is to turn abortion back to the states the way it was before Roe v. Wade.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Does that mean that if a liberal state, let's say, wants to make abortion legal, that you're okay with that and what do you say to conservative voters who believe deeply that abortion is murder?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, I think abortion is always wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've supported a variety of solutions, both state as well as federal.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"In fact, just last week, I introduced the Life at Conception act, which would say that the 14th amendment would defend an individual even in the womb.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But I think on the broader question of religion and politics, you know, I think liberty, itself requires a virtue -- requires a virtuous people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, Washington said that democracy requires a virtuous people.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Oz Guinness, the theologian, said that liberty requires restraint but the only restraint consistent with liberty is self-restraint.",0,0,0,0,0,1
There's a lot packed into that statement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the bottom line is we must have virtue, we must have a religious bearing as a nation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The government is not always going to save us and it's not always going to come from government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if we don't know right and wrong, I think we have lost our way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think we become unmoored and I think without the religious foundation that guides us all, I think we have a great risk of going horribly in the wrong direction.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sir, just 30 seconds to answer my specific...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Just 30 seconds to answer my specific question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do you favor the idea that abortion should be a states' rights issue and if a liberal state wants to make it legal, that that's their choice?",0,0,0,0,0,1
Yes or no?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Both.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, both the federal and a state approach.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.,0,0,0,1,0,1
So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.,0,0,1,0,0,1

I'd like to ask you a few questions about foreign policy broadly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dr. Carson, many experts believe Russian leader Vladimir Putin has greater ideas, bigger designs for the region beyond Russia's actions inside Ukraine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Fast forward to February 2017 and it is President Carson, and Russian uniformed commandos cross the Estonian border and they occupy a city in Estonia.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Estonia, a member of NATO, essentially invokes Article V, an attack on one is an attack on all.",0,1,0,0,0,1
What do you do?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We only have one or two.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We need much more than that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're terrified by the saber rattling.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country oil and energy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And we ought to fight them on that level.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think on Article V of NATO, we would definitely protect all of our allies.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentlemen, you've all said that the Iran nuclear deal is a bad one.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio, you were among the candidates who've said you would tear it up on day one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as you know, Iran has already received tens of millions of dollars -- tens of billions of dollars in this deal and has quickly reestablished ties economically with Europe.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"The major concessions, in other words, are up front in this deal.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So should you win by the time you take office, the remaining parts of the deal would be the constraints on Iran.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So why blow up those constraints on day one, letting Iran off the hook?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims -- all Shia Muslims on the planet.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Governor Kasich, you've said that Marco Rubio is wrong...",0,0,1,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... that Senator Rubio is wrong with tearing it up on day one.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on.",0,1,1,1,0,1
We need to move aggressively now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I would say this to you, Bret.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That is what we have to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Governor Kasich, you know that the most powerful sanctions are the multilateral ones.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And these European countries are already reestablishing these ties.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"I know, Bret.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They don't want...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Bret, here's the problem.",0,0,1,0,0,0
You take a look at the -- at Belgium.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, ""how's it going?""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The Turks are being threatened.,0,1,1,0,0,0
We know about the French.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We know about the Belgians.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We know about the Brits.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Everybody is under fire and under attack, and we have to stand together as an alliance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So actually, the opportunity is there, because of the threat to all of these countries, to bring all of us together...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(BELL RINGS),0,0,0,0,0,0
... and say there is something more important than money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the kind of leadership this country needs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"And that's only the beginning of the failures that they have committed, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world, including Russia and China.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor Christie...,0,0,0,0,0,0

... Libya is the newest base for ISIS.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"Just today, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said ISIS is consolidating their footprint there and also setting up training facilities.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"So if you were president, would you deploy U.S. troops to Libya to take out ISIS there?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, ""what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?""",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's what I'd do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is about the bigger, broader war against ISIS.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We need to bring together our European and our Sunni Arab allies, and we need to develop a strategy together to take on ISIS every place that it is around the world, so that together, all of us can take ISIS out, destroy it, and then move on to come back to our country, protect our homeland security and make sure that the American people are safe.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"As president of the United States, that is exactly what I will do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Governor.",0,0,0,0,0,0

We're not finished yet.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Welcome back to Des Moines.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's resume the debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Megyn?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Paul, you have suggested that former President Bill Clinton's history with women is fair game in this campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How do you answer those who say you don't hold the sins of the husband against the wife?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired.",0,1,0,0,0,1
They would never be hired again.,0,1,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Fired, never hired again and probably shunned in their community.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And the thing is, she can't be a champion of women's rights at the same time she's got this that is always lurking out there, this type of behavior.",0,0,1,0,0,0
So it is difficult.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of her husband's?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I combine this also with the millions upon millions of dollars they've taken from regimes in the Middle East who treat women like cattle.,0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
We have another question from one of Youtube's top creators.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm Nabela Noor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm a Muslim American born and raised in the U.S. who creates beauty and lifestyle videos on Youtube.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 2015, the number of hate crimes against Muslims in the U.S. has tripled, and on social media, where I spend a lot of time, I've seen many attacks directed towards fellow Muslims.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"This culture of hatred is only driving ISIS to radicalize, recruit and incite violence.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"As president, what would you do to address this toxic climate and promote increased tolerance in the United States?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Bush, how do you answer Nabela?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well first of all, I think it's important that when we're running for the highest office in the land that we recognize that we're living in dangerous times and we have to be serious about it, that our words have consequences.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Donald Trump, for example -- I'm glad -- I mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
... Mr. Trump believed that in reaction to people's fears that we should ban all Muslims.,0,0,1,1,0,1

She should not feel uncomfortable about her citizenship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's not the threat.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The threat is Islamic terrorism.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We need to focus our energies there, not these broad, blanket, kind of statements that will make it harder for us to deal with ISIS.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We need to deal with ISIS in the caliphate.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We need a strategy to destroy ISIS there.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You can't do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they're as threatened as we are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I think it's important for us to be careful about the language we use, which is why I've been critical of Donald Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"I think God has blessed this country with enormous natural resources, and we should pursue all of the above.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We should be developing oil, and gas, and coal, and nuclear, and wind, and solar, and ethanol, and biofuels.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But, I don't believe that Washington should be picking winners and losers.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And, I think there should be no mandates, and no subsidies whatsoever.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, indeed, my tax plan that I've introduced, it's available on our website.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It's a simple flat tax for everyone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It'll produce enormous economic growth, and it eliminates every mandate, every subsidy, so there's no subsidies for oil and gas, no subsidies for anyone.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Now, it is true that there are a bunch of lobbyists, and a bunch of Democrats in this state spending millions of dollars trying to convince the people of Iowa that I somehow oppose ethanol.",0,0,1,1,0,1
It's not true.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have introduced legislation that would phase out the ethanol mandate over five years, but that is in the context of having no mandates whatsoever for anyone.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And, I would not that there's a much more important government regulation to ethanol, and that's the EPA's blend wall that makes it illegal to sell mid-level blends of ethanol in gasoline.",0,1,1,1,0,1
I will...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(BELL RINGING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Tear down the EPA's blend wall which will enable ethanol to expand its market share by up to 60%, all without mandates.",0,1,0,1,0,1
All without any government mandates whatsoever through the marketplace.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"And, I'll note finally, Chris, there is a reason that Iowa's Congressman Steve King, perhaps the fiercest defender of farmers in this state, is sharing my campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Because he understands that I'm committed to a fair, and level playing field for every energy source without lobbyists, and without Washington picking winners and losers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dr. Carson, I'd like to ask you about exactly that issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Where are you on the mandatory ethanol standard, and precisely this question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Should government be in the business of picking winners and losers, or should it be left to the market place?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, as anyone knows who's been listening to me, you know?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm very much against the government being involved in every aspect of our lives, you know?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We last year there was an additional 81,000 pages of government regulations.",0,1,0,1,0,1
If you stack that up it would be a three-story building.,0,0,0,0,0,1
This is absolutely absurd.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And, they've insinuated themselves into everything.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, as far as the renewable fuel standard is concerned, certain promises were made, certain government contracts were issued which extend all the way into the year 2022, and I believe that it's probably unfair to withdraw the rug because people have invested money.",0,1,1,0,0,1
People have invested a lot of energy into that.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But, you know, we are blessed with tremendous energy in this nation, and we need to be looking for new sources of energy.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"We have so much natural gas now, and we can liquify it, and we can transfer it across the sea so we can make Europe dependent on us instead of Putin -- put him back in his little box where he belongs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Those are the kinds of things that we ought to be doing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, take advantage of the tremendous opportunities in energy that God has given us, not get involved in these little petty arguments.",0,0,0,0,0,0

You can't assume that.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Will you pledge-- pledge that you will not shut down the Mueller investigation?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I-- I don't pledge anything.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I will tell you, I have no intention of doing that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think it's a very unfair investigation because there was no collusion of any kind.,0,0,1,0,0,1
But you won't pledge--,0,0,0,0,0,0
There is no collusion.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"You know, Obama had the same thing.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It was on the books, but he didn't enforce it.",0,1,1,1,0,0
You--enforced it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You launched that-- the zero tolerance policy-- to deter families with children coming--,0,0,0,1,0,0
"No, but then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And frankly, when you don't do separa-- when you allow the parents to stay together, okay, when you allow that, then what happens is people are gonna pour into our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, we're looking at a lot of things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Really what we wanna do is change the immigration laws, 'cause they were-- they were a laughing stock all over the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Can I just ask this simple question, yes or no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you willing to reinstitute that policy?,0,0,0,0,0,0

I will--,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes or no.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm not gonna ask it again--,0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't have to.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Give me an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Good evening to you all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The rules for tonight are very basic and have been agreed to by all three campaigns in advance.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Candidates can take up to a minute-and-a-half to respond directly to a question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For a rebuttal, for a follow-up, 45 seconds will be allowed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are green, yellow, and red lights that each candidate will see to signal when time is running out and when they're supposed to be finished with their answers.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"I have a strategy to combat and defeat ISIS without getting us involved in another ground war, and I have plans to raise incomes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at night.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm very clear that we have a distinct difference between those of us on this stage tonight and all of our Republican counterparts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"From my perspective, we have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we've made.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"They would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"They would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.",0,0,1,1,0,0

What our country needs right now is new leadership that will bring us together around the values that unite us and the freedoms that we share as Americans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We will rise to challenge of ISIL and we will rise together to the challenges that we face in our economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Good evening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am running for president of the United States because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I'm running for president because I'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt, where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families.",0,1,1,1,0,1
I'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I'm running for president because I want a new foreign policy; one that takes on Isis, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim troops on the ground.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition I will put together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders thank you and thank you all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We do have a lot of important issues to get here tonight and we want to address the controversy of the last 24 hours right off the top because we heard some of the most heated rhetoric of the campaign so far between two of the campaigns on this stage tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Senator Sanders, you fired a campaign staffer you have sued the Democratic National Committee; all of this after your campaign acknowledge that some of your staffers quote, ""irresponsibly accessed data from another campaign.""",0,1,1,1,0,1
"The Clinton campaign called this a very egregious breech of data of ethics and said, quote, ""our data was stolen.""",0,1,1,1,0,1
Did they overstate this or were your staffers essentially stealing part of the Clinton playbook?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"David, let me give you a little bit of background here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The DNC has hired vendors.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago.",0,0,1,1,1,0
Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And when our staffers said, ""whoa, what's going here?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
They went to the DNC quietly.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"They went to the vendor and said, ""hey, something is wrong,"" and that was quietly dealt with.",0,0,0,0,0,1
None of that information was looked at.,0,1,1,1,0,1
Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A few days ago a similar incident happened.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked a that information.",0,0,1,0,0,0
As soon as we learned that they looked at that information - we fired that person.,0,1,0,1,0,0
We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"Thirdly, what I have a really problem, and as you mentioned - this is a problem, I recognize it as a problem.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign.,0,0,1,1,0,0
That is an egregious act.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I'm glad that late last night, that was resolved.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Fourthly, I work -- look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Don't know that.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"But we need an independent investigation, and I hope Secretary Clinton will agree with me for the need of that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Last point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it.",0,1,1,1,0,0
"And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"But Senator, you do mention the DNC -- the vender.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you said of your staff that they did the wrong thing.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Bernie Sanders apologizes to Hillary Clinton,0,1,0,0,0,0
"At ABC's Democratic presidential debate, candidate Bernie Sanders apologizes to rival Hillary Clinton for a scandal involving key voter data.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"So, does Secretary Clinton deserve an apology tonight?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I apologize.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Not only -- not only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton -- and I hope we can work together on an independent investigation from day one -- I want to apologize to my supporters.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is not the type of campaign that we run.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, he has apologized.",0,1,0,1,0,1
How do your react?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I very much appreciate that comment, Bernie.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It really is important that we go forward on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I know that you now have your data back, and that there has been an agreement for an independent inquiry into what did happen.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Obviously, we were distressed when we learned of it, because we have worked very hard -- I said in the beginning of this campaign, we want to reach as many voters as possible, and we have tens of thousands of volunteers doing that, and entering data all the time to keep up with what people are telling us.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And so, now that, I think, you know, we have resolved your data, we have agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Because I don't think the American people are all that interested in this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I think they're more interested in what we have to say about all the big issues facing us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, David, look, for crying out loud, our country has been attacked, we have pressing issues involving how we're going to adapt to this changing era of warfare.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our economy -- people are working harder and being left behind.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You want to know why things don't get done in Washington?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because for the last 24 hours, with those issues being so urgent to people as they tune in tonight, wondering how they're even be able to buy presents for their kids.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Instead, we're listening to the bickering back and forth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Maybe that is normal politics in Washington, but that is not the politics of higher purpose that people expect from our party.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need to address our security issues, we need to address the economic issues around the kitchen table.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if people want a more high-minded politics and want to move our country forward, go on to martinomalley.com and help my campaign move our country forward.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
All three candidates are weighing in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me agree with Governor O'Malley and let me agree with Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we had this incident before, Secretary, with your famous e-mails.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what I said and I think what Governor O'Malley is saying, and I hope you say, is when the middle class of this country is disappearing, when we have massive income and wealth inequality, when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people, all the issues that the governor talked about, the secretary talked about, those are the issues.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Media notwithstanding.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Those are the issues that the American people want discussed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope those are the issues we'll discuss.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Good let's move on -- Senator Sanders, let's move on right to some of those issues.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is just six days before Christmas, as we all know in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It's typically a joyful time, as it is this year, as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it's also an anxious time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
President Obama has acknowledged that what we saw in San Bernardino was an act of terrorism.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"But we remember the president said, right before Thanksgiving, there is no known specific and credible intelligence indicating a plot on the homeland.",0,1,1,1,0,1
We now know that this couple had assembled an arsenal.,0,1,0,1,0,0
They were not on law enforcement's radar.,0,1,1,1,0,0
They were completely undetected.,0,1,1,1,0,0
"So as we approach another holiday, with the president again saying, late this week, no credible threat, Secretary Clinton, how confident should the American people be, that there aren't others like that couple right now in the U.S. going undetected?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And what would you do as president to find them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first, the most important job of being president is obviously to keep our country safe and to keep the families of America safe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a plan that I've put forward to go after ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not to contain them, but to defeat them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it has three parts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, to go after them and deprive them of the territory they occupy now in both Syria and Iraq.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Secondly, to go after and dismantle their global network of terrorism.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And thirdly, to do more to keep us safe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under each of those three parts of my plan, I have very specific recommendations about what to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then, most importantly, here at home, I think there are three things that we have to get right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to do the best possible job of sharing intelligence and information.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That now includes the internet, because we have seen that ISIS is a very effective recruiter, propagandist and inciter and celebrator of violence.",0,0,1,1,0,1
That means we have to work more closely with our great tech companies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They can't see the government as an adversary, we can't see them as obstructionists.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We've got to figure out how we can do more to understand who is saying what and what they're planning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we must work more closely with Muslim-American communities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just like Martin, I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalization.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They will be our early warning signal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"David, I am the very first...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(inaudible) thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I am the very first post-9/11 mayor and the very first post-9/11 governor.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I understand, from the ground up, that when attacks like San Bernardino happen, when attacks like the attacks of 9/11 happen, that when people call 911, the first people to show up are the local first responders.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Many of the things Secretary Clinton said are absolutely true, but they underscore a lack of investment that we have, as a nation, failed to make over these last 15 years in intelligence gathering, intelligence analysis, intelligence sharing.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Not only in theater, in Syria and Iraq and other places where we embalk (ph) ourselves in toppling dictators without having any idea what comes next, but here in the homeland, as we protect people from this threat of the lone wolves and these changing tactics and strategies.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I believe that what's happened here is that the president had us on the right course, but it's a lack of battle tempo.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to increase the battle tempo, we have to bring a modern way of getting things done and forcing the sharing of information and do a much better job of acting on it in order to prevent these sorts of attacks in the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're going to break down these issues tonight, but I do want to go to Senator Sanders because the concern going into Christmas is significant, as you know.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A new ABC News poll shows 77 percent of Americans have little or no confidence in the government's ability to prevent a lone wolf attack.,0,0,1,1,0,1
How would you specifically find would-be terrorist who are going undetected?,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm one of the 77 percent.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I think this is a very difficult issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me tell you what I think we have got to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it's a two-pronged issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, our goal is to crush and destroy ISIS.",0,0,1,0,0,0
What is the best way to do it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think there are some differences of opinion here, perhaps between the secretary and myself.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I voted against the war in Iraq because I thought unilateral military action would not produce the results that were necessary and would lead to the kind of unraveling and instability that we saw in the Middle East.,0,0,1,1,0,1
I do not believe in unilateral American action.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I believe in action in which we put together a strong coalition of forces, major powers and the Muslim nations.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think one of the heroes in a real quagmire out there, in a dangerous and difficult world, one of the heroes who we should recognize in the Middle East is King Abdullah II of Jordan.",0,0,0,0,0,1
This small country has welcomed in many refugees.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And Abdullah said something recently, very important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said, ""Yes, international terrorism is by definition an international issue, but it is primarily an issue of the Muslim nations who are fighting for the soul of Islam. We the Muslims should lead the effort on the ground.""",0,0,0,1,0,1
And I believe he is absolutely right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, in the wake of the San Bernardino attack, you all emphasized gun control.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But our latest poll shows that more Americans believe arming people, not stricter gun laws, is the best defense against terrorism.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Are they wrong?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I think you have to look at both the terrorism challenge that we face abroad and certainly at home and the role that guns play in delivering the violence that stalks us.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Clearly, we have to have a very specific set of actions to take.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, when Senator Sanders talks about a coalition, I agree with him about that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to build a coalition abroad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We also have to build a coalition at home.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Abroad, we need a coalition that is going to take on ISIS.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know how hard that is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know it isn't something you just hope people will do and I've worked on that...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, can we stick to gun control?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I'm getting...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Are they wrong?,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm getting to that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I think if you only think about the coalition abroad you're missing the main point, which is we need a coalition here at home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Guns, in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We lose 33,000 people a year already to gun violence, arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response to terrorism.",1,0,1,1,0,1
I think what is...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Is creating much deeper, closer relations and, yes, coalitions within our own country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The first line of defense against radicalization is in Muslim-American community.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People who we should be welcoming and working with.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a ""clash of civilizations,"" that there is some kind of Western plot or even ""war against Islam,"" which then I believe fans the flames of radicalization.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So guns have to be looked at as its own problem, but we also have to figure out how we're going to deal with the radicalization here in the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders -- wait just a moment, please, Governor O'Malley.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, we've seen those long lines of people buying guns in record numbers after the Paris attacks.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Would you discourage people from buying a gun?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a country in which people choose to buy guns.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think half of the -- more than half of the people in my own state of Vermont, my guess here in New Hampshire, are gun owners.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That's the right of people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But this is what I do believe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country, I believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings, not only in San Bernardino, but in Colorado and movie theaters in Colorado, I think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"For example, talking about polls, a poll recently came out, overwhelming majority of the American people say we should strengthen the instant background check.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Who denies that it is crazy...,0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable?,0,0,1,0,0,0
We've got to eliminate the gun show loophole.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"In my view, we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I think there is a consensus.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I think -- I'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a divided country on guns.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that I, coming from a state that has virtually no gun control, will do my best to bring together.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Martha, if I may...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator Sanders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we're going to go on...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Excuse me, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, we have to abide the rules here, we'll call on you here shortly, but...",0,0,0,0,0,0
I am the only person on this stage who has actually...,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I do want pick up on something...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... passed comprehensive gun safety legislation with a ban on combat assault weapons, David.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And, look, there are profound differences...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders voted against the Brady Bill.,1,0,0,1,0,1
Senator Sanders voted to give immunity to gun dealers.,1,0,0,1,0,1
And Senator Sanders voted against even research dollars to look into this public health issue.,1,0,0,1,0,0
"Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems, having one position in 2000 and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don't need federal standards.",1,0,0,1,0,1
"Look, what we need on this issue is not more polls.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need more principle.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When ISIL does training videos that say the easiest way to get a combat assault weapon in the United States of America is at a gun show, then we should all be waking up.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We need comprehensive gun safety legislation and a ban on assault weapons.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, now -- and let me stay with gun control for a minute, then.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You talk about assault weapons.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Even if you were able to ban the purchase of assault weapons tomorrow, Americans already own an estimated 7 to 10 million semi-automatic rifles.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Would you make it illegal to own those weapons, force people to turn them in?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And if not, how would banning the sales really make a difference?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because, Martha, it would prevent people like the guy that just got charged yesterday perhaps from being able to buy combat assault weapons.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, we are the only nation, only developed nation on the planet...",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But, again, I'm not talking about buying.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Would you have them confiscated?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The ones that are already here?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, Martha, I would not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's not what we did in Maryland.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But you know what we did in Maryland?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We overcame the NRA's objections.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We overcame all of the crowds that were coming down there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We did our own rallies.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And at least if we enact these laws in a prospective way, we can address a major vulnerability in our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"ISIL videos, ISIL training videos are telling lone wolves the easiest way to buy a combat assault weapon in America is at a gun show.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"And it's because of the flip-flopping, political approach of Washington that both of my two colleagues on this stage have represented there for the last forty years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whoa, whoa, whoa.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's calm down a little bit, Martin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, let's tell the truth, Martin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I am telling the truth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, let's have some rules here, commentators.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We will.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But let me just establish that for you, senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Really quickly governor, we are going to call on you tonight and it's very clear you have a lot to say but please wait until you're called upon.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And senator, he invoked your record and I'll let you respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He sure did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll let you respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He invoked mine as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you will get some to as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First off, we can do all the great speeches we want but you're not going to succeed unless there is a consensus.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 1988, just to set the record straight governor, I ran for the U.S. House.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have one House member from Vermont, three candidates in the race.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"One candidate said, you know what, I don't think it's a great idea that we sell automatic weapons in this country that are used by the military to kill people very rapidly.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Gun people said, there were three candidates in the race, you vote for one of the others, but not Bernie Sanders.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I lost that election by three percentage points.,0,1,1,1,0,0
"Quite likely, for that reason.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So please, do not explain to me, coming from a state where democratic governors and republican governors have supported virtually no gun control.",0,0,1,1,0,1
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the gun people, in voting to ban assault weapons, voting for instant background checks, voting to end the gun show loop hole and now we're in a position to create a consensus in America on gun safety.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to move on here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you brought up Donald Trump a short time ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do and this is an important issue and I know we'll get to a lot of other critical ones as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I actually agree with Governor O'Malley about the need for common sense gun safety measures.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I applaud his record in Maryland.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have been for the Brady bill, I have been against assault weapons.",0,1,1,1,0,0
I have voted not to give gun makers and sellers immunity.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And I also know that -- and I'm glad to see this -- Senator Sanders has really moved in face of the facts about what we're confronting in our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I know that he has said in the two previous that he wants to take on this immunity issue because we need to send a strong message to the gun manufacturers, to the sellers, to the gun lobby.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I would hope, Senator Sanders, that you would join the Democrats who are trying to close the Charleston loophole, that you would sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to remove the absolute immunity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to move on this consensus that exists in the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's no longer enough just to say the vast majority of Americans want common sense gun safety measures including gun owners.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need, and only the three of us will do this, nobody on the Republican side will even admit there's a problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And in whatever way the three of us can we need to move this agenda forward and begin to deal with the gun lobby and the intimidation that they present.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to move on from guns here and go back to something you mentioned a short time ago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You brought up Donald Trump first here this evening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've now seen the polling done well after his proposed ban on Muslims coming to America.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"Thirty-six percent of Americans, more than a third, agree with him.",0,0,0,1,0,1
You have weighed in already on Donald Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've weighed in on the proposed ban.,0,0,0,1,0,1
But what would you say to the millions of Americans watching tonight who agree with him?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are they wrong?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Well I think a lot of people are understandably reacting out of fear and anxiety about what they're seeing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First what they saw in Paris, now what they have seen in San Bernardino.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And Mr. Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So what I would say is, number one, we need to be united against the threats that we face.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalized at the very moment when we need their help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I was a senator from New York after 9/11, and we spent countless hours trying to figure out how to protect the city and the state from perhaps additional attacks.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"One of the best things that was done, and George W. Bush did this and I give him credit, was to reach out to Muslim Americans and say, we're in this together.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You are not our adversary, you are our partner.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on receptive ears.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.,1,0,1,0,0,0
So I want to explain why this is not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Secretary, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, I did want to ask you about a neighbor in San Bernardino who reportedly witnessed packages being delivered to that couple's home, that it set off red flags, but they didn't report it because they were afraid to profile.",0,1,1,1,0,1
What would you say to Americans afraid to profile?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is it ever acceptable?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the answer is, obviously, if you see suspicious activity, you report it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's kind of a no-brainer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, somebody is loading guns and ammunition into a house, I think it's a good idea to call 911.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm asking about -- I'm asking about profiling.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Because a lot of people are afraid of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to talk -- I want to talk about something else, because Secretary Clinton I think made some interesting and good points.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What you have now is a very dangerous moment in American history.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The secretary is right: Our people are fearful.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They are anxious on a number of levels.,0,1,0,0,0,1
They are anxious about international terrorism and the possibility of another attack on America.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We all understand that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you know what else they're anxious about?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They're anxious about the fact that they are working incredibly long hours, they're worried about their kids, and they're seeing all the new income and wealth -- virtually all of it -- going to the top 1 percent.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And they're looking around them, and they're looking at Washington, and they're saying the rich are getting much richer, I'm getting poorer, what are you going to do about it?",0,0,1,0,0,1
What are you going to do for my kids?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And somebody like a Trump comes along and says, ""I know the answers. The answer is that all of the Mexicans, they're criminals and rapists, we've got to hate the Mexicans. Those are your enemies. We hate all the Muslims, because all of the Muslims are terrorists. We've got to hate the Muslims.""",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Meanwhile, the rich get richer.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So what I say to those people who go to Donald Trump's rallies, understand: He thinks a low minimum wage in America is a good idea.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He thinks low wages are a good idea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this country, not allow them to divide us by race or where we come from.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's create an America that works for all of us, not the handful on top.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to move to another...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Martha, may I -- Martha, may I...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, not yet, Governor O'Malley.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Can I share this quick story?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, not yet, Governor O'Malley.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll come to you when we call on you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you come back to me, I'll share that story.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You'll be happy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll let -- I'll let you talk then.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, I want to talk about a new terrorist tool used in the Paris attacks, encryption.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"FBI Director James Comey says terrorists can hold secret communications which law enforcement cannot get to, even with a court order.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"You've talked a lot about bringing tech leaders and government officials together, but Apple CEO Tim Cook said removing encryption tools from our products altogether would only hurt law-abiding citizens who rely on us to protect their data.",0,0,1,1,0,1
So would you force him to give law enforcement a key to encrypted technology by making it law?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would not want to go to that point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would hope that, given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement, that there could be a Manhattan-like project, something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries, they've got to be partners.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after.,0,0,1,0,0,0
There must be some way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't know enough about the technology, Martha, to be able to say what it is, but I have a lot of confidence in our tech experts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And maybe the back door is the wrong door, and I understand what Apple and others are saying about that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I also understand, when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks -- to go back to our early questions, how do we prevent attacks -- well, if we can't know what someone is planning, we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or, you know, the member of the mosque or the teacher, somebody to see something.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I just think there's got to be a way, and I would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Otherwise, law enforcement is blind -- blind before, blind during, and, unfortunately, in many instances, blind after.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"So we always have to balance liberty and security, privacy and safety, but I know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's what i hope, there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Governor O'Malley, where do you draw the line between national security and personal security?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that we should never give up our privacy; never should give up our freedoms in exchange for a promise of security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to figure this out together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need a collaborative approach.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need new leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The way that things work in the modern era is actually to gather people around the table and figure these things out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The federal government should have to get warrants.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"That's not some sort of passe you know, antique sort of principle that safeguards our freedoms.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But at the same time with new technologies I believe that the people creating these projects -- I mean these products also have an obligation to come together with law enforcement to figure these things out; true to our American principles and values.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"My friend Kashif, who is a doctor in Maryland; back to this issue of our danger as a democracy of turning against ourselves.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He was putting his 10 and 12-year-old boys to bed the other night.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And he is a proud American Muslim.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And one of his little boys said to him, ""Dad, what happens if Donald Trump wins and we have to move out of our homes?""",0,1,0,0,0,0
"These are very, very real issues.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Тhis is a clear and present danger in our politics within.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need to speak to what unites us as a people; freedom of worship, freedom of religion, freedom of expression.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we should never be convinced to give up those freedoms in exchange for a promise of greater security; especially from someone as untried and as incompetent as Donald Trump.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Thank you, Governor O'Malley.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Martha, we're going to turn now to refugees coming to America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And on the subject of refugees, more than half of all Americans now say they oppose taking in refugees from Syria and across the Middle East.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Secretary Clinton, you have said that it would undermine who we are as Americans, shutting our doors.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"But New Hampshire's governor, where we are right here tonight, a democrat and a supporter of yours, is among more than 30 governors who are now concerned.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Governor Maggie Hassan says, ""we should halt acceptance of Syrian refugees until U.S. authorities can assure the vetting process, halt Syrian refugees.""",0,0,0,1,0,1
Is she wrong?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I agree that we have to have the toughest screening and vetting...",0,0,0,0,0,0
But a halt?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think a halt is necessary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What we have to do is put all of our resources through the Department of Homeland Security, through the State Department, through our intelligence agencies, and we have to have an increased vetting and screening.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, this takes, David, 18 months to 24 months, two years.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So I know it's not going to happen overnight and everything that can be done should be done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the process should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS, putting together the kind of strategy that I've advocated for, and making sure that the vetting and the screening is as tough as possible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I do believe that we have a history and a tradition, that is part of our values system and we don't want to sacrifice our values.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We don't want to make it seem as though we are turning into a nation of fear instead of a nation of resolve.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I want us to have a very tough screening process but I want that process to go forward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if at the end of 18 months, 24 months there are people who have been cleared, and I would prioritize widows, and orphans, and the elderly, people who may have relatives, families, or have nowhere else to go.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I would prioritize them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that would I think give the American public a bit more of a sense of security about who is being processed and who might end up coming as refugees.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor O'Malley, obviously you were governor yourself at one time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What would you say to New Hampshire's governor tonight?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is she wrong on this?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, what I would say is this is look, I was the first of the three of us to call for America to accept the 65,000 refugees we were asked to accept.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"And if this humanitarian crisis increases, we should accept more.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So the idea of a halt or a pause?,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"David, there are wider vulnerabilities than when it comes to refugees.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I met recently with some members of the Chaldean Christian communities and the wait times are a year, 18 months, 24 months.",0,0,0,1,0,1
There is a pretty excruciating process that refugees go through.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We need to invest more in terms of the other sort of visas and the other sort of waivers.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"What these Chaldean families told me was that their families in Syria, when ISIS moves into their town, they actually paint a red cross across the door and mark their homes for demolition, and that tells the family you'd better get out now.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"The sort of genocide and brutality that the victims are suffering, these are not the perpetrators.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We need to be the nation whose enduring symbol is the Statue of Liberty, and we need to act like the great country we are, according to our values.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Governor, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, we're going to move on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to move on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
May I have a chance to respond to this issue?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to move on to the fight against ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're the one who told us we have to follow the rules and break it off.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, but the rule includes equal -- got it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
OK. Let's keep going.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's keep going.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do want to move to the fight against ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For the people of New Hampshire, the brutality of ISIS is personal.",0,0,1,0,0,0
James Foley grew up here.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The first hostage, a journalist, brutally executed last year.",0,0,1,1,0,1
You've all said ISIS is a ruthless enemy and must be stopped.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Al Qaida as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, you voted to send U.S. ground forces to fight in the coalition to help destroy Al Qaida in Afghanistan.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Can you then explain you why don't support sending U.S. combat troops to join a coalition to fight ISIS?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I also voted and helped lead the effort against the war in Iraq, which will go down in history as one of the worst foreign blunders -- foreign policy blunders in the history of our country.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"I voted against the first Gulf War, which set the stage, I believe, for the second Iraq war.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And what I believe right now, and I believe this is terribly important, is the United States of America cannot succeed, or be thought of as the policeman of the world, that when there's an international crisis all over the world, in France and in the U.K. Or -- hey, just call up the American military and the American taxpayers, they're going to send the troops.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And if they have to be in the Middle East for 20 or 30 years no problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But why Al Qaida, why not ISIS?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I have a problem with that, Martha.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I believe has got to happen is there must be an international coalition, including Russia, a well-coordinated effort.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I agree, as I mentioned a moment ago, with King Abdullah.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a war for the soul of Islam.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The troops on the ground should not be American troops.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They should be Muslim troops.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe that countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have got to step up to the plate, have got to contribute the money that we need, and the troops that we need, to destroy ISIS with American support.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The administration has tried that over and over again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If it doesn't work and this threat is so great, what's your plan B?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep.",0,0,1,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you too have ruled out a large U.S. combat force, yet you support sending in special operations forces to Syria, and sending those 100 to 200 troops to Iraq to do exploitation kill raids.",0,0,1,1,0,1
We've already lost one Delta Force member in a raid.,0,1,1,1,0,1
It has looked very much to me like we're already in ground combat on frequent trips I've made there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, are you fooling Americans when you say, we're not putting American combat troops back into Syria or Iraq?",0,0,1,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that what we're facing with ISIS is especially complicated.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was a different situation in Afghanistan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We were attacked from Afghanistan.,0,1,1,1,0,1
Al Qaida was based in Afghanistan.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We went after those who had attacked us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What's happening in Syria and Iraq is that, because of the failures in the region, including the failure of the prior government in Baghdad, led by Maliki, there has been a resurgence of Sunni activities, as exemplified by ISIS.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And we have to support Sunni-Arab and Kurdish forces against ISIS, because I believe it would be not only a strategic mistake for the United States to put ground combat troops in, as opposed to special operators, as opposed to trainers, because that is exactly what ISIS wants.",0,0,1,0,0,1
They've advertised that.,0,1,0,0,0,1
They want American troops back in the Middle East.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"They want American soldiers on the ground fighting them, giving them many more targets, and giving them a great recruiting opportunity.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So, I think it's absolutely wrong policy for us to be even imagining we're going end up putting tens of thousands of American troops into Syria and Iraq to fight ISIS.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And we do have to form a coalition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know how hard that is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have formed them.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"I put together a coalition, including Arabs, with respect to Libya and a coalition to put sanctions onto Iran.",0,0,1,1,0,0
And you have to really work hard at it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the final thing I would say, bringing Donald Trump back into it, if you're going to put together a coalition in the region to take on the threat of ISIS you don't want to alienate the very countries and people you need to be part of the coalition.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And so that is part of the reason why this is so difficult.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, I want -- I want to follow up on that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You do support sending special operations forces there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You support what the president has done already.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One of the lessons people draw from Vietnam and war since is that a little force can turn into a little more and a little more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"President Obama certainly didn't expect to be sending 30,000 additional troops into Afghanistan the first year of his presidency.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Are you prepared to run the risk of a bigger war to achieve your goals to destroy ISIS, or are you prepared to give up on those goals if it requires a larger force?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I just think you're asking a question with a false choice.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I believe if we lead an air coalition, which we are now in the position of doing and intensify it, if we continue to build back up the Iraqi army, which has had some recent success in Ramadi, as you know, if we get back talking to the tribal sheiks in Anbar to try to rebuild those relationships, which were very successful, in going after Al Qaida in Iraq, if we get the Turks to pay more attention to ISIS than they're paying to the Kurds, if we do put together the kind of coalition with the specific tasks that I am outlining, I think we can be successful in destroying ISIS.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So that's what I'm focused on, that's what I've outlined and that's what I would do as president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor O'Malley.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
You've emphasized the need for more human intelligence on the ground.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What is it our intelligence community is not doing now that needs to be done?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, we have invested nowhere near what we should be investing in human intelligence on the ground.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"And what I'm talking about is not only the covert CIA intelligence, I'm also talking about diplomatic intelligence.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I mean, we've seen time and time again, especially in this very troubled region of nation-state failures, and then we have no idea who the next generation of leaders are that are coming forward.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So what I would say is not only do we need to be thinking in military terms, but we do our military a disservice when we don't greatly dial up the investment that we are making in diplomacy and human intelligence and when we fail to dial up properly, the role of sustainable development in all of this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As president, I would make the administrator of USAID an actual cabinet member.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to act in a much more whole of government approach, as General Dempsey said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I do believe, and I would disagree somewhat with one of my colleagues, this is a genocidal threat.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"They have now created a safe haven in the vacuum that we allowed to be partly and because of our blunders, to be created to be created in the areas of Syria and Iraq.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"We cannot allow safe havens, and as a leader of moral nations around this Earth, we need to come up with new alliances and new ways to prepare for these new sorts of threats, because Martha, this will not be the last region where nation-states fail.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And you've seen a little bit of this emerging in the -- in the African Union and the things that they have done to better stabilize Somalia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to pay attention here in Central America as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So this is the new type of threats that we're facing and we need to lead as a nation in confronting it and putting together new alliances and new coalitions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I just want to quickly add...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Martha, that -- you know, one of the reasons why I have advocated for a no-fly zone is in order to create those safe refuges within Syria, to try to protect people on the ground both from Assad's forces, who are continuing to drop barrel bombs, and from ISIS.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"And of course, it has to be de-conflicted with the Russians, who are also flying in that space.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I'm hoping that because of the very recent announcement of the agreement at the Security Council, which embodies actually an agreement that I negotiated back in Geneva in June of 2012, we're going to get a diplomatic effort in Syria to begin to try to make a transition.",0,0,0,0,0,1
A no-fly zone would prevent the outflow of refugees and give us a chance to have some safe spaces.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Secretary Clinton, I'd like to go back to that if I could.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"ISIS doesn't have aircraft, Al Qaida doesn't have aircraft.",0,1,1,1,0,1
So would you shoot down a Syrian military aircraft or a Russian airplane?,0,0,1,0,0,0
I do not think it would come to that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are already de-conflicting air space.,0,0,1,1,0,1
We know...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But isn't that a decision you should make now, whether...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I don't think so.",0,1,0,0,0,0
I am advocating...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... if you're advocating this?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I'm also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now that Russia has joined us in the Security Council, has adopted an agreement that we hashed out a long day in Geneva three years ago, now I think we can have those conversations.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"The no-fly zone, I would hope, would be also shared by Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If they will begin to turn their military attention away from going after the adversaries of Assad toward ISIS and put the Assad future on the political and diplomatic track, where it belongs.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"I want to take this to Senator -- I'm going to take this to Senator Sanders next, because I think there...",0,0,1,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our differences are fairly deep on this issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We disagreed on the war in Iraq.,0,0,1,1,0,0
We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I voted against the war.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But I think -- and I say this with due respect -- that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, we could get rid of Saddam Hussein, but that destabilized the entire region.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"Yes, we could get rid of Gadhafi, a terrible dictator, but that created a vacuum for ISIS.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in my view, what we need to do is put together broad coalitions to understand that we're not going to have a political vacuum filled by terrorists, that, in fact, we are going to move steadily -- and maybe slowly -- toward democratic societies, in terms of Assad, a terrible dictator.",0,0,1,0,0,1
But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS and working over the years to get rid of Assad.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's the secondary issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is exactly...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is exactly what I just said and what I just described.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, but, Secretary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that is important, because now we have a U.N. Security Council that will enable us to do that.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, you know, with all due respect, Senator, you voted for regime change with respect to Libya.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You joined the Senate in voting to get rid of Gadhafi, and you asked that there be a Security Council validation of that with a resolution.",0,0,0,1,0,1
All of these are very difficult issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know that; I've been dealing with them for a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, of course, we have to continue to do what is necessary when someone like Gadhafi, a despot with American blood on his hands, is overturned.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I'll tell you what would have happened, if we had not joined with our European partners and our Arab partners to assist the people in Libya, you would be looking at Syria.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Now the Libyans are turning their attention to try to dislodge ISIS from its foothold and begin to try to move together to have a unified nation.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I was not the secretary of state...,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Senator Sanders, Senator Sanders, hold on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One moment, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to ask the secretary here, because there does appear to be some daylight here between the policies, at least in respect to when you take out Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Right now or do you wait?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you tackle ISIS first?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have said, Secretary Clinton, that you come to the conclusion that we have to proceed on both fronts at once.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We heard from the senator just this week that we must put aside the issue of how quickly we get rid of Assad and come together with countries, including Russia and Iran, to destroy ISIS first.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Is he wrong?,0,0,1,0,0,0
I think we're missing the point here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are doing both at the same time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But that's what he's saying, we should put that aside for now and go after ISIS.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"Well, I don't agree with that, because we will not get the support on the ground in Syria to dislodge ISIS if the fighters there who are not associated with ISIS, but whose principal goal is getting rid of Assad, don't believe there is a political, diplomatic channel that is ongoing.",0,0,1,0,0,1
We now have that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have the U.N. Security Council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path.,0,0,0,1,0,1
It's very important we operate on both at the same time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And let me just say a word about coalition-building, because I've heard Senator Sanders say this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know how hard it is to build coalitions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more Iranian troops inside Syria.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Iranians getting more of a presence in Syria, linking with Hezbollah, their proxy in Lebanon, would threaten Israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with Assad's future.",0,0,1,1,0,1
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
I happen to think...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to offer a...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
She says we have to proceed on both fronts at once.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Secretary Clinton is right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a complicated issue.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I don't think anyone has a magical solution.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But this is what I do believe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, of course Assad is a terrible dictator.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But I think we have got to get our foreign policies and priorities right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The immediate -- it is not Assad who is attacking the United States.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It is ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And ISIS is attacking France and attacking Russian airliners.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"The major priority, right now, in terms of our foreign and military policy should be the destruction of ISIS.",0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think -- and I think we bring together that broad coalition, including Russia, to help us destroy ISIS.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And work on a timetable to get rid of Assad, hopefully through Democratic elections.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First priority, destroy ISIS.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator sanders, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
May I offer a different generation's perspective on this?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor O'Malley?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"During the Cold War -- during the Cold War, we got into a bad habit of always looking to see who was wearing the jersey of the communists, and who was wearing the U.S. jersey.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"We got into a bad habit of creating big bureaucracies, old methodologies, to undermine regimes that were not friendly to the United States.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Look what we did in Iran with Mosaddegh.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And look at the results that we're still dealing with because of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would suggest to you that we need to leave the Cold War behind us, and we need to put together new alliances and new approaches to dealing with this, and we need to restrain ourselves.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, I know Secretary Clinton was gleeful when Gadhafi was torn apart.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the world, no doubt is a better place without him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But look, we didn't know what was happening next.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And we fell into the same trap with Assad, saying -- as if it's our job to say, Assad must go.",0,0,1,1,0,0
We have a role to play in this world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we need to leave the Cold War and that sort of antiquated thinking behind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But -- you criticized -- you criticized Secretary Clinton for what came next.,0,0,1,0,0,0
What's your proposal for what comes after Assad?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that we need to focus on destroying ISIL.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is the clear and present danger.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I believe that we can springboard off of this new U.N. resolution, and we should create, as Secretary Clinton indicated, and I agree with that, that there should be a political process.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we shouldn't be the ones declaring that Assad must go.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Where did it ever say in the Constitution, where is it written that it's the job of the United States of America or its secretary of State to determine when dictators have to go?",0,0,0,0,0,1
We have a role to play in this world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it is not the world -- the role of traveling the world looking for new monsters to destroy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
David...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Since he has been making all kinds of comments.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it's fair to say, Assad has killed, by last count, about 250,000 Syrians.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"The reason we are in the mess we're in, that ISIS has the territory it has, is because of Assad.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"I advocated arming the moderate opposition back in the day when I was still secretary of State, because I worried we would end up exactly where we are now.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And so, when we look at these complex problems, I wish it could be either/or.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I wish we could say yes, let's go destroy ISIS and let's let Assad continue to destroy Syria, which creates more terrorists, more extremists by the minute.",0,0,1,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We now finally are where we need to be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS, which is a danger to us as well as the region...",0,0,0,1,0,0
Secretary...,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we finally have a U.N. Security Council Resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition in Syria.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Could I just say -- just say this...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the United States does not lead, there is not another leader.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There is a vacuum.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can I just say this...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have to lead, if we're going to be successful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, a last word on this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course the United States must lead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the United States is not the policeman of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The United States must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The United States, at the same time, cannot successfully fight Assad and ISIS.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"ISIS, now, is the major priority.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Let's get rid of Assad later.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's have a Democratic Syria.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the first task is to bring countries together to destroy ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we come back here tonight, the other major issues of this election: jobs, the economy, health care.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Which candidates will make the best case for the middle class, as our coverage of the Democratic debate, here in New Hampshire, continues right after this on ABC.",0,0,0,0,0,1
ABC News coverage of the New Hampshire Democratic debate will continue in a moment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Welcome back tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As you can see, we have a packed audience here in New Hampshire and we're going to continue.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We've already had a spirited conversation here at the top of the broadcast about ISIS, about the concerns of terror here on the homefront and as we await Secretary Clinton backstage, we're going to begin on the economy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We want to turn to the American jobs, wages and raises in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we believe Secretary Clinton will be coming around the corner any minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But in the mean time we want to start with this eye-opening number.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Senator Sanders, this question goes to you first, anyway.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 1995, the median American household income was $52,600 in today's money.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"This year, it's $53,600.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That's 20 more years on the job with just a 2 percent raise.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In a similar time-frame, raises for CEOs went up more than 200 percent.",0,1,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Sorry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to continue here, and Secretary, you'll get a chance on this too.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as I pointed out the CEO pay, 200 percent of their time -- for that family of just 2 percent.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"You've all said, ""you would raise the minimum wage.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
But Senator Sanders what else - speak to that household tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"20 years, just a 2 percent raise, how as president would you get them a raise right away?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, we recognize that we have a rigged economy, as you've indicated.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Middle class in this country for the last 40 years has been disappearing; are we better of today then we were when Bush left office?,0,0,0,1,0,1
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as you've indicated for millions of American workers, people in New Hampshire -- all over America, they're working longer hours for lower wages deeply worried about their kids.",0,0,1,1,0,1
So what do we do?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First statement is, we tell the billionaire class, ""they cannot have it all.""",0,0,1,0,0,1
"For a start, they're going to start to pay their fair share of taxes.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Second of all what we do, is you raise the minimum wage to living wage, 15 bucks an hour over the next several years.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Next thing we do, pay equity for women workers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Women should not be making 79 cents on the dollar compared to that.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"Next thing that we do, real unemployment -- official unemployment, 5 percent, real employment 10 percent, youth unemployment, off the charts.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"We rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, our roads our bridges, our rail systems, we create 13 million jobs with a trillion-dollar investment.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Furthermore, in a competitive global economy, it is imperative that we have the best educated workforce in the world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That is why I'm going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation to make certain that public colleges and universities in America are tuition free.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Senator Sanders, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor O'Malley, what would propose that would be different, how would you get the middle class a raise and without waiting another 20 years for another 2 percent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Look these are the things that we did in own state through the recession.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We actually passed a living wage.,0,1,0,1,0,0
We raised the minimum wage.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"We actually raised it to the highest goals of any state in the nation also in minority and women participant goals because we understood that the way you reinvigorate and make fair market American capitalism work, is to make the choices and the investments that include more people more full in the economic success of your state.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"All through the recession, we defended the highest median income in America and the second highest median income for African American families.",0,0,0,1,0,1
How?,0,0,0,0,0,0
By actually doing more for education.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We increased education funding by 37 percent.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We were the only state in American that went four years in a row without a penny increase in college tuition.,0,1,0,1,0,1
We invested more in our infrastructure and we squared our shoulders to the great business opportunity of this era and that is moving our economy to a 100 percent clean electric energy future.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"We created 2,000 new jobs in the solar industry and we fought every single day to adopt more inclusive economic practices.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So David, the conclusion of all of those things is this; they weren't hopes, they weren't dreams, they weren't amorphous goals out there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We actually took action to do these things and as president, I have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all American families.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Universal national service is an option for every kid in America to cut youth employment.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And I'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for America's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great American cities and get them back to work.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Governor, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"As you were walking in, I was talking about the median American household getting a two percent raise over the last 20 years, that CEO pay in that same time frame has gone up 200 percent.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"So for those families watching tonight, how do you get them a raise if you're president?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I've been talking to a lot of these families, and this is such an outrage, both because it's bad for our economy, we're a 70 percent consumption economy, people need to feel optimistic and confident, they need to believe their hard work is going to be rewarded, and it's bad for our democracy.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"It's absolutely the case that if people feel that the game is rigged, that has consequences.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think it's great standing up here with the senator and the governor talking about these issues, because you're not going to hear anything like this from any of the Republicans who are running for president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"They don't want to raise the minimum wage, they don't want to do anything to increase incomes.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"At the center of my economic policy is raising incomes, because people haven't been able to get ahead, and the cost of everything, from college tuition to prescription drugs, has gone up.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Of course we have to raise the minimum wage.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Of course we have to do more to incentivize profit sharing, like we see with Market Basket right here in New Hampshire and New England, where all of the employees get a chance to share in the profits.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've got to do more on equal pay for equal work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That means pass the Paycheck Fairness Act so we have transparency about how much people are making.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"That's the way to get women's wages up, and that's good for them and good for their families and good for our communities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And there is a lot we can do in college affordability.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have debt-free tuition plans, free community college plans, getting student debt down.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I also am very committed to getting the price of drugs down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there's a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can go to my website...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... hillaryclinton.com, and read about it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I guess the final thing that -- that I would say is this is the kind of debate we need to take to the Republicans in the fall.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the election...,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to -- we're going to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... issues they have to respond to.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're going to talk about college education in a moment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Secretary Clinton, I did want to ask you, the last time you ran for president, Fortune Magazine put you on its cover with the headline Business Loves Hillary, pointing out your support for many CEOs in corporate America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm curious, eight years later, should corporate America love Hillary Clinton?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Everybody should.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I have said I want to be the president for the struggling, the striving and the successful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to make sure the wealthy pay their fair share, which they have not been doing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I want the Buffett Rule to be in effect, where millionaires have to pay 30 percent tax rates instead of 10 percent to nothing in some cases.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I want to make sure we rein in the excessive use of political power to feather the nest and support the super wealthy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But I also want to create jobs and I want to be a partner with the private sector.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm particularly keen on creating jobs in small business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My dad was a small businessman, a really small business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to do more to help incentivize and create more small businesses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So if -- if people who are in the private sector know what I stand for, it's what I fought for as a senator, it's what I will do as president, and they want to be part of once again building our economy so it works for everybody, more power to them, because they are the kind of business leaders who understand that if we don't get the American economy moving and growing, we're not going to recognize our country and we're not going to give our kids the same opportunities that we had.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Secretary, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to stay on this and ask you how big a role does corporate America play in a healthy economy and will corporate America love a President Sanders?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I think they won't.",0,1,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
So Hillary and I have a difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.,0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room, which is the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"When you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two-thirds of the credit cards and one-third of the mortgages, when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail, we've got to re- establish Glass-Steagall, we have got to break the large financial institutions up.",0,1,1,1,0,1
So I don't think...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"... having said that, I don't think I'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from Wall Street.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't have a super PAC.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I don't want campaign contributions from corporate America.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And let me be clear: While there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing, in my view -- and I say this very seriously -- the greed of the billionaire class, the greed of Wall Street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of Americans.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"We need an economy that works for the middle class, not just a handful of billionaires, and I will fight and lead to make that happen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, let me just ask you, though, because it is an important question, how important a role do you think corporate America plays in a healthy economy here in the U.S.?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I look at our economy as an ecosystem.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate, the more our workers earn, the more they will spend, the more our economy will grow.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And most heads of businesses -- large, medium and small -- understand that.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're not going to fix what ails our economy, we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace American capitalism with socialism -- which, by the way, the rest of the world is moving away from -- nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And for my part, I have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on Wall Street in ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"In fact, in the last debate, very shamefully, she tried to hide her cozy relationship with Wall Street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9/11.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for -- for upward mobility of wages.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And the worst type of concentration, Secretary Clinton, is the concentration of the big banks, the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them, oh, you weren't responsible for the crash, not by a long shot.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"And that's why today you still cannot support, as I do, breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern-day Glass- Steagall, like we had in late 1999, before it was repealed and led to the crash, where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And I was on the front lines of that, looking into the eyes of my neighbors...",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor O'Malley, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do want to ask you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just ask you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me respond...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We did -- we did -- Secretary Clinton, let me just ask you...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under the rules, I have been -- I have been invoked, David, so let me respond very quickly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Number one...,0,0,0,0,0,0

And we're going to move on to health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, the Department of Health and Human Services says more than 17 million Americans who are not insured now have health coverage because of Obamacare.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"But for Americans who already had health insurance the cost has gone up 27 percent in the last five years while deductibles are up 67 percent, health care costs are rising faster than many Americans can manage.",0,1,0,1,0,1
What's broken in Obamacare that needs to be fixed right now?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what would you do to fix it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I would certainly build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the glitches that you just referenced.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, we do have more people who have access to health care.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We have ended the terrible situation that people with pre- existing conditions were faced with where they couldn't find at any affordable price health care.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Women are not charged more than men any longer for our health insurance.,0,1,0,1,0,1
And we keep young people on our policies until they turn 26.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Those are all really positive developments.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But out-of-pocket costs have gone up too much and prescription drug costs have gone through the roof.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"And so what I have proposed, number one, is a $5,000 tax credit to help people who have very large out-of-pocket costs be able to afford those.",0,0,0,1,0,1

(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
We end up paying the highest prices in the world.,0,1,0,1,0,1
And I want us to be absolutely clear about making sure the insurance companies in the private employer policy arena as well as in the Affordable Care exchanges are properly regulated so that we are not being gamed.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I think that's an important point to make because I'm going through and analyzing the points you were making, Martha.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't have enough competition and we don't have enough oversight of what the insurance companies are charging everybody right now.,0,0,1,0,0,1
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
But you did say those were glitches.,0,0,1,1,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just glitches?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Twenty-seven percent in the last five years, deductibles up 67 percent?",0,0,0,1,0,1
It is.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"We have fought, as Democrats, for decades to get a health care plan.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We want to build on it and fix it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm confident we can do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it will have effects in the private market.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend Medicaid.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"And so people are still going to get health care, thankfully, in emergency rooms, in hospitals.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Those costs are then added to the overall cost, which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system.",0,1,0,1,0,1

"Senator Sanders, I want you to respond to what she was saying, but you're instead calling for single-payer health care.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"Yes, exactly, exactly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You note people won't have to pay deductibles or premiums but they will have to pay new taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Can you tell us specifically how much people will be expected to pay?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, well, roughly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As a member of the Health Education Committee that helped write the Affordable Care Act, much of what Secretary Clinton said about what we have done, among other things, ending the obscenity of this pre-existing situation is a step forward.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Seventeen more million more people have health care.,0,0,0,1,0,1
It is a step forward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A step forward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But this is what we also have to say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not only are deductibles rising, 29 million Americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor.",0,1,0,1,0,1
Major crisis and primary health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here is the bottom line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why is it that the United States of America today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right?,0,0,0,1,0,1
Why is it...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why is it that we are -- why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they pay in France, countries that guarantee health care to all of their people and in many cases, have better health care outcomes.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Bottom line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This ties into campaign finance reform.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The insurance companies, the drug companies are bribing the United States Congress.",0,1,1,1,0,1
We need to pass a Medicare for all single payer system.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It will lower the cost of health care for a middle-class family by thousands of dollars a year.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Senator Sanders, you didn't really tell us specifically how much people will be expected to pay...",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But they will not be paying, Martha, any private insurance.",0,1,1,1,0,1
So it's unfair to say in total...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you can't tell us this specifically, even if you were...",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I can tell you that adding up the fact you're not paying any private insurance, businesses are not paying any private insurance.",0,1,1,1,0,1
The average middle-class family will be saving thousands of dollars a year.,0,0,0,1,0,1
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's go to talk about the high cost of college education and for that we turn to the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, right here at Saint Anselm college, Neil Levesque.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Neil?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here to New Hampshire again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As you know, this auditorium is filled with many Saint Anselm college students.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They know the outstanding student debt right now in America is $1.3 trillion.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"That private education costs have gone up in the last decade 26 percent, and 40 percent for public education.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"So knowing that, we know you want to make public education more affordable but how do you really lower the cost?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, you mentioned a few minutes ago that you want free tuition for public colleges.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And universities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How does that really lower the cost other than just shifting the cost to taxpayers?,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, Neil, I think we've got to work on a two-pronged approach.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And your point is absolutely well taken.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation.,0,1,0,1,0,1
There are a lot of factors involved in that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums.,0,0,1,1,0,1
Maybe we should focus on quality education with well-paid faculty members.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And I understand in many universities a heck of a lot of vice presidents who earn a big salary.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But, bottom line is this is the year 2015.",0,0,0,0,0,1
If we are going to be competitive in the global economy we need the best educated workforce.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It is insane to my mind, hundreds of thousands of young people today, bright qualified people, cannot go to college because they cannot afford -- their families cannot afford to send them.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Millions coming out of school as you indicated, deeply in debt.",0,0,1,1,0,0
What do we do?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My proposal is to put a speculation tax on wall street, raise very substantial sums of money, not only make public colleges and universities tuition-free, but also substantially lower interest rates on student debt.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"You have families out there paying 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent on student debt, refinance their homes at 3 percent.",0,0,0,1,0,1
What sense is that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I think we need radical changes in the funding of higher education.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We should look at college today the way high school was looked at 60 years ago.,0,0,0,0,0,1
All young people who have the ability should be able to get a college education.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Governor O'Malley, how do you propose -- Governor O'Malley, how do you propose lowering some of these costs associated with higher education?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, this one falls under the category of, I have actually done this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
As a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition.,0,0,0,1,0,1
My plan actually goes further than Senator Sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees.,0,0,0,1,0,1
So as a nation we need to increase what we invest in Pell grants.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Yes, we need to make it easier for parents to refinance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But states need to do more as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that all of our kids should go into an income-based repayment plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I mean, we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones.",0,1,1,0,0,1
There're families all across America who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after World War II on a G.I.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Bill.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But today, we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's a drag on the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's one of the key investments we need to make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was flattered that Secretary Clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in our party, unlike the Republican party, we actually believe that the more our people learn, the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, how does your plan differentiate from your opponents?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I have what I call the new college compact.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I think everybody has to have some skin in this game, you know.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, States have been dis-investing in higher education.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"In fact, I think New Hampshire, in state tuition for public colleges and universities, is among the highest if not the highest in the country.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"So states over a period of decades have put their money elsewhere; into prisons, into highways, into things other than higher education.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"So under my compact, the federal government will match money that the states begin to put back in to the higher education system.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Secondly, I don't believe in free tuition for everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe we should focus on middle-class families, working families, and poor kids who have the ambition and the talent to go to college and get ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I have proposed debt free tuition, which I think is affordable and I would move a lot of the Pell Grant and other aid into the arena where it could be used for living expense.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So I put all of this together, again, on my website and I've gotten such a good response.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to quickly say, one of the areas that Senator Sanders touched on in talking about education and certainly talking about health care is his commitment to really changing the systems.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Free college, a single payer system for health, and it's been estimated were looking at 18 to $20 trillion, about a 40 percent in the federal budget.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"And I have looked at his proposed plans for health care for example, and it really does transfer every bit of our health care system including private health care, to the states to have the states run.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And I think we've got to be really thoughtful about how we're going to afford what we proposed, which is why everything that I have proposed I will tell you exactly how I'm going to pay for it; including college.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Thank you Secretary Clinton, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
May I respond to the critique on the ...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Back to you David.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to get right into this Senator but I want to ask about taxes next.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is included.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would just...,0,0,0,0,0,0
She was asking about that...,0,0,0,0,0,0
But Secretary Clinton is wrong.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"As you know, because I know you know a lot about health care.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know that the United States per capita pays far and away more than other country.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"And it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that, we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the Secretary's Clinton proposal.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Well, the only thing - the only thing I can go on Senator Sanders...",0,0,0,0,1,0
Are we back on health care - Secretary Clinton hold one moment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders...,0,0,0,0,0,0

Your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And my analysis is, that you are going to get more taxes out of middle class families.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I'm the only person...,0,0,0,0,0,0
So let's ask about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, let's turn to the taxes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"... saying, no middle class tax raises.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That's off the table...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is where we are going next, we are going next to taxes here...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, this is getting to be fun.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is fun.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
This is democracy at work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about your tax plan because from the crushing cost of college education, the next question most families have; is will my taxes go up under the next president?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You have said it's your goal not to raise taxes on families making under $200,000 a year a goal.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But can you say that's a promise as you stand here tonight?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is a pledge that I'm making.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I made it when I ran in 2008.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A promise?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, and it was the same one that President Obama made.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Because I don't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise middle class families' taxes.,0,0,1,0,0,1
We just heard that most families haven't had a wage increase since 2001.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"Since, you know, the end of the last Clinton administration when incomes did go up for everybody.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And we've got to get back to where people can save money again, where they can invest in their families, and I don't think a middle-class tax should be part of anybody's plan right now.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Let me respond to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me respond to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, most important economic reality of today is that over the last 30 years, there has been a transfer of trillions of dollars from the middle class to the top one-tenth of one percent who are seeing a doubling of the percentage of wealth that they own.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Now, when Secretary Clinton says, ""I'm not going raise taxes on the middle class,"" let me tell you what she is saying.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"She is disagreeing with FDR on Social Security, LBJ on Medicare and with the vast majority of progressive Democrats in the House and the Senate, who today are fighting to end the disgrace of the United States being the only major country on Earth that doesn't provide paid family and medical leave.",0,0,1,1,0,1
What the legislation is is $1.61 a week.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Now, you can say that's a tax on the middle class.",0,0,1,0,0,1
It will provide three months paid family and medical leave for the working families of this country.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"I think, Secretary Clinton, $1.61 a week is a pretty good invest.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Senator, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me bring in Governor O'Malley...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, I have been -- I have been fighting for paid...",0,0,0,0,0,0
You've heard...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... family leave for a very long time...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"David, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a way to pay for it that actually makes the wealthiest pay for it...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then (inaudible)...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... not everybody else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Every (inaudible) Democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rosa DeLauro, got ears (ph) to legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to bring in Governor O'Malley on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We heard the promise from Secretary Clinton because people want to know about their taxes, will they go up.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"She has now promised here tonight not to raise them on families making $250,000 or less.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Can you make that same promise if you're elected?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I've never made a promise like that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But unlike either of these two fine people, I've actually balanced a budget every single year.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I was one -- I was the only -- one of only seven states that had a AAA bond rating.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"By the time I left, the average tax burden on Maryland families was the same as when I started.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But I did pass a more progressive income tax and asked the highest-earning people to pay another 14 percent.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"David, look, this is the big -- I agree, by the way, that we should have paid family leave.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I agree with Senator Sanders on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And just like Social Security and unlike the Republicans, I think we should actually expand Social Security and increase average monthly benefits.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But look, there's one big entitlement we can no longer afford as a country, and that is the entitlement that the super wealthy among us, those earning more than a million dollars, feel that they're entitled to pay lower income tax rates and a far lower preferred income tax rate when it comes to capital gains.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"If we were to raise the marginal rate to 45 percent for people earning more than a million dollars and if we tax capital gains essentially the same we do earnings from hard work and sweat and toil, you could generate $800 billion over the next ten years and that would do so much good for affordable college, debt-free college, cutting youth unemployment in half, investing in our cities again.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So the things I have done in office are the things that actually invest in growing our economy and making wages go up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's the issue that we need to tackle as Americans, and we can do it and we know how.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor O'Malley, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A spirited debate on taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But you also have many in law enforcement who now say there has been a so-called Ferguson effect, police holding back because they're afraid of backlash.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"In fact, the FBI director is calling it a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So, if elected president, how would you bridge the divide between the two?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, David, I think this is one of the most important challenges facing not just our next president but our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular, in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I feel very strongly that we have to reform our criminal justice system and we have to find ways to try to bring law enforcement together again with the communities that they are sworn to protect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Trust has been totally lost in a lot of places.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"At the same time, we know that in many parts of our country police officers are bridging those divides and they're acting heroically.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The young officer who was killed responding to the Planned Parenthood murders.,0,1,1,1,0,0
The officer who told the victims of the San Bernardino killings that he would take a bullet before them.,0,0,1,1,0,1
So I think that we need to build on the work of the policing commissioner that President Obama impaneled.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who feel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not only deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but more opportunities, more jobs, better education so that we can begin to rebuild that very valuable asset known as trust.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor O'Malley, how would you bridge the divide?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is no issue in American public policy that I have worked on more day in and day out than this painful issue of policing, of law enforcement, criminal justice and race in America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I ran in 1999, David, for mayor of Baltimore, our city by that year had become the most addicted, violent, and abandoned in America.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But we came together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I brought people together over some very deep racial divides.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we were able to put our city on the path for the biggest reduction in crime of any major city in America over the next ten years.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"As governor, we continued to work together.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We reduced violent crime to 30-year lows.,0,1,0,1,0,1
But get this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We also reduced incarceration rates to 20-year lows.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"So it is possible actually, to find the things that actually work, that we did, increasing drug treatment, using big data to better protect the lives of young people, cut juvenile crime in half, and it's also possible to improve how we police our police.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But there wasn't a single day as mayor of Baltimore that I wasn't asked whether I was delivering on the promise I made to police the police.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"We reported excessive force, discourtesy, use of lethal force.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"In fact, drove down to three of the four lowest years on record police use of lethal force.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments more open, more transparent, and more accountable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just as we require every major department, every county to report its major crimes, we should require police departments to report their discourtesy, brutality, excessive force.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"There's so much work that can be done, so much we've learned to do better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to do it now as a nation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is our time and our opportunity to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Senator Sanders, when you hear the FBI director calling it a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement, does that concern you as well when you --",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, this whole issue concerns me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I agree with much of what the secretary and the governor have said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's be clear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Today in America we have more people in jail than any other country on earth, 2.2 million people.",0,1,0,1,0,1
Predominantly African-American and Hispanic.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We are spending $80 billion a year locking up our fellow Americans.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"I think, and this is not easy, but I think we need to make wage a major effort, to come together as a country and end institutional racism.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice system.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, what does that mean?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, for a start it means that police officers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African-Americans.",0,0,1,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"It means that we have to rethink the so-called war on drugs which has destroyed the lives of millions of people, which is why I have taken marijuana out of the Controlled Substance Act.",0,1,1,1,0,1
So that it will not be a federal crime.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is why we need to make...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
That is why we need to make police -- and I speak as a former mayor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was a mayor for eight years, worked very closely with a great police department.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And what we did is try to move that department toward community policing, so that the police officers become part of the community and not, as we see, in some cities an oppressive force.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to end minimal sentencing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need, basically, to pledge that we're going to invest in this country, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We want to turn now to an issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This next issue has destroyed so many families across the country, and in particular right here in New Hampshire, heroin.",0,1,0,1,0,0
And there's a stunning new figure out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A recent poll -- 48 percent here, in this state alone, say they know someone who has abused heroin.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We're going to turn tonight to Dan Tuohy of the New Hampshire Union Leader who has this question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"New Hampshire has been hard hit by the heroin epidemic, and we're on track to have twice as many overdose deaths this year as in 2013.",0,1,0,1,0,1
What specifically would you do to address this crisis?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, I'm going to take this to you first because you've seen what's happened with heroin right on the border in your own state.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, this is a tragedy for New Hampshire.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It is a tragedy for my state of Vermont.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is a tragedy all over this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The number of heroin deaths are growing very, very significantly.",0,1,1,1,0,1
What do we do?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, for a start, this may seem like a radical idea, but I think we have got to tell the medical profession and doctors who are prescribing opiates and the pharmaceutical industry that they have got to start getting their act together, we cannot have this huge number of opiates out there throughout this country, where young people are taking them, getting hooked, and then going to heroin.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Second of all, and the reason I believe in a health care for all program, we need to understand that addiction is a disease, not a criminal activity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And that means -- and that means radically changing the way we deal with mental health and addiction issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When somebody is addicted and seeking help, they should not have to wait three, four months in order to get that help.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They should be able to walk in the door tomorrow and get a variety of treatments that work for them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So those are some of the areas that I think we've got to move on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, on my very first visit to New Hampshire in this campaign, I was in Keene, and I was asked what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And all over New Hampshire, I met grandmothers who are raising children because they lost the father or the mother to an overdose.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I met young people who are desperately trying to get clean and have nowhere to go, because there are not enough facilities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So this is a major epidemic, and it has hit New Hampshire and Vermont particularly hard.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"I've had had two town halls, one in Keene, one in Laconia, dedicated exclusively to talking about what we can do.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I've heard some great ideas about how law enforcement is changing its behavior, how the recovery community is reaching out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I was proud to get the endorsement of Mayor Walsh of Boston, who has made his struggle with alcoholism a real clarion call for action in this arena.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I've laid out a five-point plan about what we can do together.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would like the federal government to offer $10 billion over ten years to work with states, and I really applaud Governor Hassan for taking up this challenge and working with the legislature here to come up with a plan.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We need to do more on the prescribing end of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are too many opioids being prescribed, and that leads directly now to heroin addiction.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"And we need to change the way we do law enforcement, and of course, we need more programs and facilities, so when somebody is ready to get help, there's a place for them to go.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And every law enforcement should carry the antidote to overdose, Naloxone, so that they can save lives that are on the brink of expiring.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Secretary, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you know, I actually know a great deal about this issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I have a dear friend, played music with him for years, remember when his -- when he came home with his baby girl, and now she's no longer with us, because of addiction and overdose.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The last time in New Hampshire, I had to take a break shortly after landing and call home and comfort a friend whose mother had died of an overdose.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Drugs have taken far too many of our citizens.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It's a huge public health challenge.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In our own city, I mentioned before, we had become the most addicted city in America.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But together, every single year, I expanded drug treatment funding within our city and then I expanded it in our state, and we were saving lives every single year doing the things that work, intervening earlier, understanding the continuum of care that's required until we got hit like every other state in the state -- in the United States, especially in New Hampshire and in the northeast with this opioid addiction, the over-prescribing.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"I agree, we need better -- we need to rein in the over- prescribing, but I have put forward on my -- in my plan a $12 billion federal investment.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We have to invest in the local partnerships, and the best place to intervene, the best indicator of when a person is actually on the verge of killing themselves because of an addiction, is at the hospital.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That very first time they show up with a near miss, we should be intervening there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what I said to my own public health people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What would we do if this were ebola?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How would we act?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So many more Americans have been killed by the combination of heroin and these highly addictive pain pills, and yet, we refuse to act.",0,1,1,1,0,1
There are thing that can be done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go on to my website.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My plan is there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's one of 15 strategic goals I've set out to make our country a better place by cutting these sort of deaths in half in the next five years.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Governor O'Malley, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Martha?,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, I want to circle back to something that your opponents here have brought up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Libya is falling apart.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"The country is a haven for ISIS and jihadists with an estimated 2,000 ISIS fighters there today.",0,0,1,1,0,1
You advocated for that 2011 intervention and called it smart power at its best.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And yet, even President Obama said the U.S. should have done more to fill the leadership vacuum left behind.",0,0,0,1,0,0
How much responsibility do you bear for the chaos that followed elections?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first, let's remember why we became part of a coalition to stop Gadhafi from committing massacres against his people.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"The United States was asked to support the Europeans and the Arab partners that we had and we did a lot of due diligence about whether we should or not, and eventually, yes, I recommended and the president decided that we would support the action to protect civilians on the ground and that led to the overthrow of Gadhafi.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"I think that what Libya then did by having a full free election, which elected moderates, was an indication of their crying need and desire to get on the right path.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, the whole region has been rendered unstable, in part because of the aftermath of the Arab Spring, in part because of the very effective outreach and propagandizing that ISIS and other terrorist groups do.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"But what we're seeing happening in Libya right now is that there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that exist among Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS from Sirte, the home town of Gadhafi, and to begin to try to create a national government.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"You know, this is not easy work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We did a lot to help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We did as much as we could because the Libyans themselves had very strong feelings about what they wished to accept.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we're always looking for ways about what more we can do to try to give people a chance to be successful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, I want to go back.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That -- government lacked institutions and experience.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It had been a family business for 40 years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"On the security side, we offered only a modest training effort and a very limited arms buy-back program.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Let me ask you the question again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How much responsibility do you bear for the chaos that followed those elections?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Martha, we offered a lot more than they were willing to take.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We offered a lot more.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"We also got rid of their chemical weapons, which was a big help, and we also went after a lot of the shoulder-fired missiles to round them up.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"You know, we can't -- if we're not going to send American troops, which there was never any idea of doing that, then to try to send trainers, to try to send experts, is something we offered, Europeans offered, the U.N. offered, and there wasn't a lot of responsiveness at first.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"I think a lot of the Libyans who had been forced out of their country by Gadhafi who came back to try to be part of a new government, believed they knew what to do and it turned out that they were no match for some of the militaristic forces inside that country.",0,0,1,0,0,1
But I'm not giving up on Libya and I don't think anybody should.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've been at this a couple of years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But were mistakes made?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, there's always a retrospective to say what mistakes were made.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I know that we offered a lot of help and I know it was difficult for the Libyans to accept help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What we could have done if they had said yes would have been a lot more than what we were able to have done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, the secretary is right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a terribly complicated issue.,0,0,1,0,0,0
There are no simple solutions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But where we have a disagreement is that I think if you look at the history of regime changes, you go back to Mossaddegh (ph) in Iran, you go back to Salvador Allende who we overthrew in Chile, you go back to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq, you go back to where we are today in Syria with a dictator named Assad.",0,0,1,0,0,1
The truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like America to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator.,0,0,1,0,0,1
So I think secretary Clinton and I have a fundamental disagreement.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm not quite the fan of regime change that I believe she is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Martha -- I would just repeat that --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I would just repeat that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait a minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it's only fair to put on the record, Senator Sanders voted in the Senate for a resolution calling for ending the Gadhafi regime and asking that the U.N. be brought in, either a congressional vote or a U.N. Security Council vote.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We got a U.N. Security council vote.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, I understand that this is very difficult.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm not standing here today and saying that Libya is as far along as Tunisia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We saw what happened in Egypt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I cautioned about a quick overthrow of Mubarak, and we now are back with basically an army dictatorship.",0,0,1,0,0,0
This is a part of the world where the United States has tried to play two different approaches.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"One, work with the tough men, the dictators, for our own benefit and promote democracy.",0,0,1,0,0,0
That's a hard road to walk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think it's the right road for us to try to travel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And Martha...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Quick Governor O'Malley.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... and in this case, we probably let our lust for regime toppling get ahead of the practical considerations for stability in that region.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I believe that one of the big failings in that region is a lack of human intelligence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have not made the investments that we need to make to understand and to have relationships with future leaders that are coming up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what Chris Stevens was trying to do.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But without the tools, without the support that was needed to that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And now what we have is a whole stretch now, of the coast of Libya, 100 miles, 150 miles, that has now become potentially the next safe haven for ISIL.",0,0,0,1,0,1
They go back and forth between Syria and this region.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to stop contributing to the creation of vacuums that allow safe havens to develop.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to move on here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor O'Malley, thank you very much for that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're going to make a very sharp turn as we wrap things up here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, first ladies, as you well know, have used their position to work on important causes like literacy and drug abuse.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But they also supervise the menus, the flowers, the holiday ornaments and White House decor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know you think you know where I'm going here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have said that Bill Clinton is a great host and loves giving tours but may opt out of picking flower arrangements if you're elected.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Bill Clinton aside, is it time to change the role of a president's spouse?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the role has been defined by each person who's held it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I am very grateful for all my predecessors and my successors because each of them not only did what she could to support her husband and our country but often chose to work on important issues that were of particular concern.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obviously, Mrs. Obama has been a terrific leader when it comes to young people's health, particularly nutrition and exercise.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think has had a big impact.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So whoever is part of the family of a president has an extraordinary privilege of not only having a front row seat on history but making her or maybe his contribution.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And with respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice, and in particular, how we're going to get the economy working again for everybody, which he knows a little bit about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Democrats discuss presidential spouses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Candidates Hillary Clinton, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders talk about the roles their spouses would play in helping run the Oval Office (ABC News).",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do want to follow up here for each of you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And a similar line of questioning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, your wife Jane shares an office at your campaign headquarters in Burlington.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've seen the pictures, the desks right next to each other.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Would she have a desk close by in the west wing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Given the fact that she's a lot smarter than me, yes, she would.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And let me, by the way, take this moment to congratulate Hillary Clinton, who I thought not only did an outstanding job as our first lady, but redefined what that role could be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I thank you very much for that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"My wife, Jane, has been -- way back when before I knew her, a foster parent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Many, many kids came into her home and received the kind of love that they desperately needed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And she turned around many lives.,0,1,0,0,0,0
She is the best parent and grandmother that I know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She has devoted her life, when I was mayor of the city of Burlington, actually when I first met her, we started a youth office, which started a after-school programs for kids, started a child care center, started a youth newspaper.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We got the kids involved in a whole lot of issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She led that effort.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I think, at a time when so many of our kids are desperately looking for constructive activity, where too many of our kids are hanging around on street corners, potentially getting into trouble, I think we need a forceful advocate for the children, for teenagers, for the little children, to deal with the dysfunctional child care system, and I think my wife would do a great job in helping me accomplish those goals.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that would be totally up to her.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, Katie has never been a person who let her husband's professional choices get in the way of following her dreams.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think she got that from her mother, actually.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"The -- and I readily admit that she is a far more accomplished lawyer than I was ever able to become, before I took my detour.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She is a district court judge in Maryland.,0,0,0,0,0,1
She puts in a full day there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've raised four terrific kids.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And yet, when she was first lady of the state, not only would she go to work every day and sit there through a lot of sad and gut-wrenching cases, but then she'd put in additional time being an advocate against domestic violence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Maryland made great strides on that because of her advocacy, and her understanding of how the court process works.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She was an advocate against bullying and implementing anti-bullying things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So Katie O'Malley will do whatever Katie O'Malley wants to do, regardless of her husband's success in getting elected president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor O'Malley, thank you, (inaudible).",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll be back with much more from New Hampshire.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Democratic debate continues right after this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Welcome back tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's been an evening of lively discussion among the candidates and it's time for closing statements.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We began in alphabetical order, so we'll reverse the order at the end and begin with you, Senator Sanders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, thank you very much for hosting this debate, and let me applaud my colleagues up here.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0
One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They're voting out of enthusiasm.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Let's begin with jobs and the economy, which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election.",0,0,0,0,0,1
There have been some real differences expressed in - on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"One of Mr. Trump's, the front runner's, signature issues is ending what he calls ""disastrous trade deals"" in order to bring jobs back to America.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Governor Kasich, I'd like to start with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You've been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Critics say these deals are great for corporate America's bottom line, but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs.",0,1,1,1,0,1
How do you respond to the criticism that you've been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade.,0,0,0,0,0,1
One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"But my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, ""Oh, America was right,"" and people are out of work.",0,0,1,0,0,1
The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up.",0,0,0,0,0,1
People will buy less.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Other people will be out of work.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And we don't want to see that happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Trade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I understand their plight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you've brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Why should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because nobody knows the system better than me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know the H1B.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know the H2B.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody knows it better than me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm a businessman.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These are laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These are regulations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These are rules.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're allowed to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries - the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete.",0,1,1,1,0,1
So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm the one that knows how to change it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you're, quote, ""generally very much in favor of free trade.""",0,0,0,1,0,1
"More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I support free trade deals that are good for America.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We're 5 percent of the world's population.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The problem is we're a low-tariff country.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
There are good trade deals and there are bad ones.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It's allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry.,0,1,0,1,0,1
We have a surplus with Colombia.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"On the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Cruz, you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Why should these voters who don't like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Actually that's incorrect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are two different agreements.,0,0,0,0,0,1
There's TPA and TPP.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But we're getting killed in international trade right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas.,0,0,1,0,0,1
We're driving jobs overseas.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And you've got to understand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"So the question is, what's the solution?",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's easy to talk about the problems.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But do you have a solution to fix it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think the solution is several things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America.",0,1,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Let's go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Stephen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers.",0,1,0,1,0,1
Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements.,0,0,0,1,0,1
You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Doesn't this program take jobs away from Americans?,0,0,1,0,0,0
If it's being abused the way Disney did.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"Under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans, but that you've tried to hire Americans.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again.",0,0,1,0,0,1
The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India.",0,1,1,1,0,1
That company then hoards up all of these visas.,0,1,0,1,0,0
They hire workers.,0,1,0,1,0,0
You hire - Disney or some other company hires this company.,0,0,0,0,0,1
What they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"It is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio, real quick follow-up on this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"You've - in the - in the context of illegal immigration, you've called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Correct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you've talked about are solved.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well first, I think - well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"If there's an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that's in violation of the law.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"And what I'm explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not - what they are doing is they are eliminating the job.",0,0,1,1,0,1
They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company.,0,0,0,1,0,1
They are making the argument that we didn't replace you.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead.,0,1,0,1,0,1
And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad.,0,0,0,1,0,1
It's a loophole they've figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way.,0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, ""lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers"".",0,0,1,1,0,1
He's calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Wouldn't that help workers in the U.S.?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have immigration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we clearly have to control our borders.,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's not that we don't know how to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's that we're lacking the political will.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this.,0,1,1,1,0,0
The Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor.,0,1,1,1,0,1

He wants competitive schools.,0,0,0,1,0,0

"But I'm going to have Ben very involved with education, something that's an expertise of his.",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"So when you say ""education by Washington, D.C.,"" what do you mean?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're right, Jake.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it has been taken over by the federal government.,1,1,0,1,0,1
It was originally supposed to be that way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And certainly sounds better that way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington, and they are not interested in what's happening in Miami or in Florida, in many cases.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Now in some cases they would be.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"OK, I've been working on this for many, many years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, Jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to start connecting them to the real world.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"So, Senator Cruz, let me bring you in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You object to Common Core.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor Kasich says it's local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards.,0,0,0,1,0,0
What's wrong with that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Common Core is a disaster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if I am elected president, in the first days as president, I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it's easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"Now, the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and I intend to do that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Beyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And give every child - African American, Hispanic - every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits, and they're very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Let me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So, what should the new retirement age be?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And how much will those benefits be cut?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, let me say that you're right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we don't have to make any changes for them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Any politician that goes around saying, ""We don't have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,"" they're not being honest with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If I were still in the Senate, I'd be one of the youngest people there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Medicare Advantage does that now.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"These are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, the question was specific though.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm sorry I didn't answer that part.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So the thing is that my - my generation, someone my age would retire at 68.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And so my children would retire at 70.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I would retire at 68.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It would be a graduating scale over a period of time.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But again I'm talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're years away from retirement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For people that are on it now, we don't have to change it at all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we don't do anything, we will have a debt crisis.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It's not a question of if.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is a question of when.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That's - all of it will be eaten up by that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's a debt crisis.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis.,0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you don't want to raise the retirement age, and you also don't want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I've watched them very intensely, even though it's a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They're leaving it the way it is.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"In fact, they want to increase it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They want to actually give more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's what we're up against.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And whether we like it or not, that is what we're up against.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And it's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not increase the age and to leave it as is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have 22 years, you have a long time to go.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It's not long in terms of what we're talking about, but it's still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters.",1,0,0,1,0,1
If that ever happened in China.,0,0,1,0,0,0
you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a - it's a national tragedy.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"We're at zero, we're not doing anything.",1,0,0,0,0,0
We've lost our jobs.,0,1,0,0,0,0
We've lost everything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're losing everything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country.",0,1,0,1,0,1
I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you're talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent.",0,1,1,1,0,1
So how would you find that other $147 million?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because they don't cover most of the subjects.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're the policemen of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We take care of the entire world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to have a stronger military, much stronger.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our military is depleted.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"But we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We take - every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships.",0,0,0,0,1,0
We get virtually nothing.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"We have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between North and South Korea.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We have so many places.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them.",0,1,1,1,0,1
We are going to be in a different world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to negotiate real deals now, and we're going to bring the wealth back to our country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We owe $19 trillion.,0,1,0,1,0,1
We're going to bring wealth back to our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio, will that be enough to save Social Security?",0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I - and I think you've outlined why.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The numbers don't add up.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"You know, when I ran for the Senate in 2010, I came out and said we're going to have to make changes to Social Security, and everyone said that's the end of your campaign.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"In Florida, you can't talk about that, but people know that it's the truth here in Florida.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Fraud is not enough.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Certainly, let's wipe out the fraud, but as you said, it won't add up.",0,0,1,0,0,0
You already gave those numbers.,0,0,0,1,0,0
The second point is on foreign aid.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I hear that all the time as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget.",0,0,1,1,0,1
The numbers don't add up.,0,0,0,1,0,1
The bottom line is we can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I'm going to get at fraud and abuse.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up.,0,0,1,1,0,1
And here's the thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Not to mention a crisis in Social Security and Medicare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Both parties have taken far too long to deal with it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It is one of the major issues confronting America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's barely been asked in any of these debates.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And we'd better deal with or we're going to have to explain to our children why they inherited this disaster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio says your numbers don't add up.",0,0,1,1,0,1
What's your response?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Rubio says that your numbers don't add up.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"What's your response, Mr. Trump?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I don't know if he's saying that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Look, I'm just saying very simply we have a country that I've never seen anything like it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've been going over budgets and looking at budgets.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't bid things out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We don't bid out, as an example, the drug industry, pharmaceutical industry.",0,1,1,0,0,1
They don't go out to bid.,0,1,0,0,0,0
They just pay almost as if you walk into a drug store.,0,0,0,1,0,1
That's what they're paying.,0,0,0,1,0,0

Let's take a broader look at the Republican Party now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, one of the concerns your opponents have expressed throughout the course of this campaign is the notion that in their estimation you hold views that are at direct odds with Republican Party tradition.",0,0,1,1,0,0
How are you looking to fundamentally change the Republican Party as its potential leader?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What should the Republican Party stand for in 2016?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I don't really think that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that I hold views that are very similar to many of the people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are more inclusive.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it's, again, the biggest story.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am different in one primary respect, and that's trade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"The jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"You look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So that's that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"The devaluations of their currencies by China and Japan and many, many other countries, and we don't do it because we don't play the game.",0,0,1,1,0,1
and the only way we're going to be able to do it is we're going to have to do taxes unless they behave.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"If you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"And if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up.",0,1,1,1,0,1
It has gone down.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And I think that's why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I'm saying.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Senator Cruz...,0,0,0,0,0,0

... Donald Trump has so far won 35 percent of the vote.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Those people are signing up to his vision of the Republican Party.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What do you think is wrong with that vision?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Donald is right, for example, he was just talking about international trade.",0,0,1,0,0,1
He's right about the problems.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But his solutions don't work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Now he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I don't know where he'll be tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'll tell you what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we've seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, Smoot- Hawley led to the Great Depression.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to Walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"But not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the American people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"A much better solution that works is the tax plan I've laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for Americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Fix the problem and that's what's missing from what Donald says.,0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, we'll give you a chance to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The 45 percent tax is a threat.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"It was not a tax, it was a threat.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It will be a tax if they don't behave.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Take China as an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They can't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
China won't let them.,0,1,1,0,0,0
We talk about free trade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's not tree free trade, it's stupid trade.",0,0,1,0,0,1
China dumps everything that they have over here.,0,1,1,1,0,0
"No tax, no nothing, no problems, no curfews (ph), no anything.",0,1,0,0,0,1
We can't get into China.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"I have the best people, manufacturers, they can't get in.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"When they get in, they have to pay a tremendous tax.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"The 45 percent is a threat that if they don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell.,0,1,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Cruz?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jake, let me be clear what Donald just said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He said that that 45 percent tax is a threat.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"And mind you, you are paying the tax.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It's not China that pays the tax.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"It's you, the working men and women.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So ask yourself at home,0,0,0,0,0,0
How is this helping you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can't pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, ""I'm going to jack - I'm going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
That hurts you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's why we've got to get beyond rhetoric of China bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in America.,0,0,1,0,0,1
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jake, I have to say - honestly, it's just the opposite.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What will happen if they don't behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Instead of in China, we'll build them here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And people will buy products from here, rather than buying it through China where we're being ripped off.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And we have a $505 billion trade deficit right now.,1,1,1,1,0,1
So we'll build our factories here and we'll make our own products.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the way it should be done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the way we've been doing it for the last long period of time is our country - our country is in serious, serious trouble.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"It's a bubble and it's going to explode, believe me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to take a very quick break.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Do you want to clarify the comment at all?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you know, I've been watching the debate today.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they're talking about radical Islamic terrorism or radical Islam.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"There's something going on that maybe you don't know about, maybe a lot of other people don't know about, but there's tremendous hatred.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"Senator Rubio, your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, said in response to Mr. Trump's comment last night, I'm sorry - Senator Jeff Flake, I apologize.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in response to that comment, Republicans are better than this.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Do you agree?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me say, I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says cause he says what people wish they could say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The problem is, presidents can't just say anything they want.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has consequences, here and around the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And so let me give you one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Two days ago, I met this extraordinary couple who were on furlough because they are missionaries in Bangladesh.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's a very tough place to be a missionary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's Muslim.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And their safety and security very much relies upon friendly Muslims that live along side them, that may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America, leading political figures are saying that America doesn't like Muslims.",0,0,1,1,0,1
So this is a real impact.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's no doubt that radical Islam is a danger in the world.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you're going to see crescent moons there.",0,0,0,0,0,1
If you go anywhere in the world you're going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims.,0,0,0,0,0,1

And they love America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as far as I know, no one on this stage has served in uniform in the United States military.",0,1,0,1,0,1
Anyone out there that has the uniform of the United States on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves America.,0,0,0,0,0,0

There have been a lot of problems.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now you can say what you want, and you can be politically correct if you want.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to be so politically correct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I like to solve problems.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Women are treated horribly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You do know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The question was asked, what do you think?",0,0,0,0,0,0

We do work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There is - Islam has a major problem on its hands.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"It has a significant percentage of its adherents, particular in the Sunni faith but also in the Shia, who have been radicalized.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And are willing to fly planes into a building and kill innocent people.,0,0,1,0,0,0
There is no doubt about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face, we are going to have to work together with other - with Muslims, who do not - who are not radicals.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have to work with the Jordanian kingdom.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We're going to have to work with the Saudis.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And when that happens, that means that every veteran will get work, because they're our golden employees.",0,0,0,0,0,0
No veteran ought to be without healthcare; no veteran ought to be homeless; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the United States of America.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Thank you, Governor Kasich.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's turn to another issue of real importance here in Florida.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just over a week from now, President Obama will visit Cuba, the first time in 88 years that a sitting U.S. president will set foot in Cuba.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Two of you on this stage have parents who were born in Cuba and moved to the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Let's go back to my colleague Dana Bash.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio, Donald Trump agrees with President Obama in his decision to reengage diplomatically in Cuba.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The majority of Americans seem to agree with that as well.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So why are President Obama, Donald Trump and the majority of Americans wrong?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I would love the relationship between Cuba and the United States to change.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it will require Cuba to change, at least its government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Today, it has not.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"The fact of the matter is that after these changes were made - after these changes were made, there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the Castro regime.",0,1,1,1,0,1
It will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They'll put a puppet figure forward as their new president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And nothing will change for the Cuban people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The only thing that's changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And we asked nothing in return.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Compare that to the changes that were required in Burma.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And by no means is Burma a perfect country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But at least when there was a democratic opening to Burma, they were required to make some democratic openings.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"When there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body.",0,0,1,1,0,1
He asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"And Cuba and its regime remains an anti-American communist dictatorship, helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"It's harboring fugitives of American justice, including people stealing our Medicare money and moving back to Cuba, all in exchange for nothing.",0,1,1,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you said the concept of opening Cuba is fine.",0,0,0,1,0,0
You said the concept of opening Cuba is fine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why do you agree with President Obama and disagree with what Senator Rubio just said?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I don't really agree with President Obama.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think I'm somewhere in the middle.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now, Cuba is making - as usual with our country, we don't make good deal.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We don't have our right people negotiating, we have people that don't have a clue.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"As an example, I heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the United States, and nobody's talking about it and they'll end up signing a deal and then we'll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion.",0,1,1,1,0,1
All that stuff has to be agreed to now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't want to get sued after the deal is made.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"So I don't agree with President Obama, I do agree something should be - should take place.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"After 50 years, it's enough time, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that's going to happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This was just a little story but it was a big story to me because I said oh, here we go, we make a deal, then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"So I want to do something, but it's got to be done intelligently.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to make good deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But just to be clear, Mr. Trump, are you saying that if you were president, you would continue the diplomatic relations or would you reverse them?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would want to make a good deal, I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cuba's favor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, everything, every single aspect of this deal is in Cuba's favor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It the same way as the Iran deal.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We never walked - we never - all we do is keep giving.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We give and give and give.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Mr. Trump, just to be clear, there is an embassy that you would have to decide whether it would be open or whether you would close it.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Which would it be?,0,0,0,0,0,0
In Havana.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, first of all, the embassy is the former consulate.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It's the same building.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So it could just go back to being called a consulate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't have to close it that way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Second of all, I don't know where Cuba is going to use, but if they sue us in a court in Miami, they're going to lose.",0,1,1,0,0,1
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Third, on the issue of a good deal, I know what the good deal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'll tell you what the good deal now, it's already codified.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Here's a good deal - Cuba has free elections, Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, Cuba has freedom of the press, Cuba kicks out the Russians from Lourdes (ph) and kicks out the Chinese listening station in Berupal (ph) Cuba stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions, Cuba takes all of those fugitives of America justice, including that cop killer from New Jersey, and send her back to the United States and to jail where she belongs.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And you know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then we can have a relationship with Cuba.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's a good deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator Rubio.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Cruz, if you become president, would you reverse course and once again break diplomatic relations with Cuba?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I would.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you know, I think this exchange actually highlights a real choice for Republican primary voters.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When it comes to foreign policy, do you want to continue on the same basic trajectory as the last seven years of the Obama foreign policy?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When it comes to these deals, Cuba and Iran, they were negotiated by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.",0,1,0,1,0,1
There's a real difference between us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald supported Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And what he said right now is that he agrees in principle with what they're doing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals, they should be more effective.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have a fundamental disagreement and I think most Republicans and most Americans do, that we shouldn't be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to Cuba, to go to Iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us.",0,1,1,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you Senator Cruz.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, if Ted was listening, he would have heard me say something very similar.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it's got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"As far as Iran is concerned, I would have never made that deal.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"That is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country.",0,1,0,0,0,1
It is a disaster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So for Ted to say I agree with this deal, I mean, it's a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I've ever seen negotiated.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So don't try to put it on me like it's wonderful, like I love it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Cruz, your response?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, look.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that Donald supported John Kerry in 2004 over George W. Bush, and he supported Hillary Clinton, gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"And indeed, once she was secretary of State, he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of State in industry.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And, you know, the point on the Iran deal, his answer to everything is if only if someone smarter were in government, things would be better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't just need smarter people in government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need leaders that are protecting American interests.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when it comes to Iran, Donald has said he would leave the agreement in place and try to renegotiate it, giving the Ayatollah Khomeini over $100 billion.",0,1,0,1,0,1
That reflects you do not understand the radical Islam terrorist that is the Ayatollah that wants to murder us.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We need a commander in chief that understands our enemies...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(BELL RINGS),0,0,0,0,0,0
... understands and doesn't give them billions of dollars to threaten our safety and security.,0,1,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I was against the giving of the money at all cost.,0,0,1,0,0,1
I said don't negotiate at all until you get the prisoners back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
If the prisoners don't come back early - three years ago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of the longest negotiations I've ever seen, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If they don't come back early, I was saying don't negotiate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They come back early.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What you do is you take it back and you say, either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions.",0,0,1,1,0,0
What we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Cause that deal is a disaster.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Ted, the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very, very poor negotiators.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"But that money, the $150 billion, is largely gone and already spent everywhere but the United States.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Thank you Mr. Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's refocus this back on Cuba.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Kasich, a pair of entrepreneurs from Alabama and North Carolina have just received approval to build the first U.S. factory in Cuba, making tractor for small farms.",0,1,0,1,0,1
This is a direct result of President Obama's policy in Cuba that we've been talking about.,0,0,0,0,0,1
If you were elected would you encourage more U.S. companies to do business like that in Cuba?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I wouldn't.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Listen, I think the problem with the administration, if you talk to our friends around the world, they say what is America doing?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, you don't support us, we can't figure out where you are.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You won't arm the freedom fighters in Ukraine, we let the Russians trump up some excuse in the business of Russian-speaking people.",0,0,1,0,0,0
You had a red line in Syria.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You walked away from it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You refused to fund the Syrian rebels, you undercut Egypt and we ended up with the Muslim brotherhood for awhile.",0,0,1,1,0,0
And then we turn our back on Netanyahu when he comes to Congress to talk about his concerns of the Iranian deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I know in human nature sometimes there's a sense that you make better with your enemies than you do with your friends.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you know what happens when you do that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You make a terrible mistake.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You need to support your friends, you need to hold your enemies out here...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... and you need to negotiate tough deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The fact is, they need to understand who we are.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Chinese understand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They don't own the South China Sea.,0,1,1,1,0,1
They have to stop hacking everything we have in this country or we'll take out their systems.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We will arm the Ukrainians so they have lethal defensive aid.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We will destroy ISIS and Mr. Putin, you better understand, you're either with us or you're against us.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We're not rattling a sword.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You're not our enemy but we're not going to put up with this nonsense any longer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And a strong America is what the entire world is begging for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Where has America gone is what many of our allies say around the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(BELL RINGS),0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I'm president, they're going to know exactly where we are because we're coming back.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you governor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you governor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"While we're discussing the issues of importance to Floridians, I reached out to the Republican mayor of Miami, Tomas Regalado, to find out what he wanted to hear from you this evening.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mayor Regalado told me, quote, ""Climate change means rising ocean levels, which in south Florida means flooding downtown and in our neighborhoods. It's an every day reality in our city. Will you, as president acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change and as president, will you pledge to do something about it?""",0,0,0,0,0,1
Unquote.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio, the Miami mayor has endorsed you.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Will you honor his request for a pledge and acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change and pledge to do something about it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing.",1,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
There's never been a time when the climate has not changed.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"I think the fundamental question for a policy maker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So on the issue of flooding in Miami, it's caused by two things.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Number one, south Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I have long supported mitigation efforts.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there's no such thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the contrary, there is laws they want us to pass.",0,0,1,0,0,0
There are laws they want to us pass that would be devastating for our economy or these programs like what the president has put in with the Clean Power Act or all these sorts of things that he's forcing down our throats on the war on coal.,0,1,1,0,0,1
Let me tell you who is going to pay the price of that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Americans are going to pay the price of that.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the American consumer, the single parent, the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The businesses who are going to leave America because it's more expensive to do business here than anywhere else.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And you know what passing those laws would have - what impact it would have on the environment?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Zero, because China is still going to be polluting and India is still going to be polluting at historic levels.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"So, I am in favor of a clean environment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
My children live in South Florida.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My family is being raised here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want this to be a safe and clean place, but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"So just to clarify, Senator Rubio, Mayor Regalado when he talks about the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change, the Republican mayor of Miami, he's saying the scientific consensus is that man does contribute to climate change.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"When you talk to him, because he is the mayor of Miami and he has endorsed you, do you tell him that he's wrong?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would say to him that there is no law that they want us to pass that would have any impact on that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"If we pass - if you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Sea level would still rise.,1,1,0,0,0,1
All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"One, because America is not a planet.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And number two, because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut.",1,0,1,1,0,1
Here's what he will immediately - and Mayor Regalado is a great mayor and a good friend - but here's what he's going to immediately going to start hearing from.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He will immediately start hearing from families in South Florida who are barely making it by, and now their electric bill went up $20 or $30 a month because we just made it more expensive to generate power.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That cost will be passed on to working families.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I am not going to destroy the U.S. economy for a law that will do nothing for our environent.,0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Kasich, what would you say to the mayor of Miami?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I - I do believe we contribute to climate change, but I don't think it has to be a, you know, either you're for some environmental stringent rules or, you know, you're not going to have any jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The fact is, you can have both.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"In our state, we've reduced emissions by 30 percent.",0,1,0,1,0,1
But let me tell you also what we're trying to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We want all the sources of energy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We want to dig coal, but we want to clean it when we burn it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We believe in natural gas.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We believe in nuclear power.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you know what else I believe in?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I happen to believe in solar energy, wind energy, efficiency, renewables matter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, it doesn't mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment, because we don't know how much humans actually contribute.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But it is important we develop renewables.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Battery technology can unleash an entirely different world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Senator Cruz, I want to talk a little bit right now about how you gentlemen see the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Does it matter to you what the rest of the world thinks of the United States?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course it does.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we've seen for seven years a president that has made the presidency and has made, sadly, his administration a laughing stock in the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Then he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the United States of America.,1,1,0,0,0,0
Our friends and allies quickly learned America could not be counted on.,0,0,0,0,0,0

How do you respond...,0,0,0,0,0,0
That doesn't mean I was endorsing that.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I was not endorsing it.,0,1,1,0,0,0
