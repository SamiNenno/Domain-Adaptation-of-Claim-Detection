Welcome to all of you who are joining us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re here with the three remaining Republican candidates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the audience tonight Republican and some independents, all of whom say they are voting in next week’s Republican primary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some have already made their decisions on a candidate, others still undecided.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They came up with the questions you’ll hear tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We reviewed them to make sure the questions don’t overlap.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m going to ask a few questions as well, but tonight this town hall is a chance for voters to hear at length from the candidates.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, let’s get right to it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Joining us right now, the U.S.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator from Texas.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please welcome Ted Cruz.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Welcome.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, good to be with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Congratulations on a big endorsement from the governor of the state, Scott Walker.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Obviously a great thing for your campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to hear a lot of questions tonight from the voters on the issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to just start by talking to you about a couple of issues of the day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As you know, you talked a little bit today, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski (ph), charged today with Simple Battery.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"If he was your campaign manager, would you ask him to resign?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, it shouldn’t be complicated that members of the campaign staff should not be physically assaulting the press.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I mean, that shouldn’t be a complicated decision.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He says he’s innocent of all the charges.,0,0,0,1,1,0
Well…,0,0,0,0,0,0
…  Do you believe it was assault?,0,0,0,1,0,0
He has just been charged.,0,0,1,1,1,1
I know that the reporter alleged that she was physically assaulted.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"That I will say, it’s consistent with the pattern of the Trump campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think it says something about the campaign itself?,0,0,0,0,0,0
About the leadership?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The culture of the campaign has been a campaign built on attacks, on insults, and I think there is no place in politics for insults, for personal attacks, for going to the gutter, and there should be no place for physical violence either.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to ask you about the path ahead for you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
you need 85 percent of the remaining delegates to secure the nomination.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Not impossible, but highly improbable.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Will you admit tonight that a contested convention is your best bet to get the nomination?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not remotely because…,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think you can get 85 percent?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Absolutely, and our path going forward is to get 1,237.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Most of the races coming up are either winner-take-all, or winner-take-most.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, you’ve only gotten 30 percent of the delegates so far.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We’re half over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well…,0,0,0,0,0,0
…  How do you go from 30 percent to 85 percent?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’ll tell you, the way you do that — it’s the situation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If two guys are hiking in the woods, and a bear start chasing, and you know the old joke that the fellow sits down and starts to put on his running shoes?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the guy turns to his friend and says, “What are you doing?",0,0,0,0,0,0
You can’t outrun the bear.”,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, the guy says, “I don’t have to outrun the bear, I just have to outrun you.”",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That principal is the same thing going forward, if we continue to beat Donald Trump — you know, we just had a few days ago in Utah a massive victory against Donald Trump and we got all of the delegates in Utah.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"If we continue to beat Donald Trump going forward most of the states are winner-take-all or winner-take-most, and we get North of 80 percent of the delegates simply by beating Donald Trump going forward.",0,0,0,0,1,1
But Donald Trump is still way out in front of you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He won Louisiana.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"You got more delegates out of Louisiana, which he is obviously upset about, but I mean, 85 percent in the remaining races, that’s more than you’ve ever gotten anywhere.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Look, but you don’t have to win 85 percent, Anderson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The way it works, you have to win the races going forward but when you win, you get most or all the delegates.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And here’s the dynamic that has played out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A year ago there were 17 candidates.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"It was a fantastic, diverse, dynamic field.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The field has narrowed now.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And what Donald benefits from is division because Donald has had pretty consistently a floor of about 20 to 25 percent.,0,0,0,0,1,1
But he has got a hard ceiling of about 35 to 40 percent that he has a real hard time breaking.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And so when there are two or three or four other candidates and they divide the vote, he can win state after state with 30, 35 percent, even 40 percent.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Head to head, Donald has an incredibly difficult time breaking 50 percent.",0,0,0,0,1,0
The Kasich campaign has made an effort to reach out to your campaign to strike some sort of a pact in order to defeat Donald Trump.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Wouldn’t that make sense?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Apparently all the reports are so far you’ve not responded.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"Well, it makes no sense at all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
John Kasich has no path to win it.,0,0,1,1,0,0
We are competing to win.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re not competing to stop Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re competing to win the nomination.,0,0,0,0,0,0
John Kasich went 0 for 27.,0,1,1,0,1,0
He lost 27 states in a row.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"He admits though it’s going to go to a contested convention, that’s where he says he can win.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I understand, except that it’s against the rules for John Kasich to be on the ballot.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"The rules provide that in order to be even on the ballot, if no one has 1,237, you have to have won at least 8 states.",0,1,0,0,1,1
"Now, there are only two candidates who are going to meet that threshold, Donald Trump and me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so our preferred option is win 1,237 delegates before the convention.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We are working hard to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I’ll mention Wisconsin is going to be critical in that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the second option, which is entirely possible, we could get to a convention where nobody has 1,237 delegates, and we come in with a ton of delegates, Donald Trump comes in with a ton of delegates.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"And if that happens, then it becomes a battle for the delegates, but the only two names on the ballot are going to be Donald Trump and me.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"On the rules, those are the only two people that can be voted on.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And I think in that situation, we’re in a very strong position to earn the 1,237 votes from the delegates who are elected by the people.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I want to talk about some policy here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the wake of the horrible attacks that we saw in Brussels, you proposed securing our borders, crushing ISIS, stopping refugees.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"But you also suggested that law enforcement “patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.” John Kasich said about that proposal: “So what we want to do is start policing Muslim neighborhoods, create more divisions, start policing neighborhoods in here La Crosse?",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is politics trying to appeal to people’s base instincts and fears.”,0,0,0,1,0,0
Is that what you’re doing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, what I believe we should do is we need a commander-in-chief who is actually focused on keeping this country safe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we saw…",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What does it mean, though, “patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods”?",0,0,0,0,0,0
How do you decide what neighborhoods — what’s a Muslim neighborhood?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me answer your question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We had a terror attack in Brussels last week.,0,0,1,1,0,1
It was a horrific attack.,0,0,0,1,0,0
President Obama could barely be bothered to stop his baseball game with communist dictators to say anything about it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when he did, he followed this bizarre pattern that he has followed for year after year after year where he refuses to say the words “radical Islamic” terrorism.",1,0,1,1,1,0
"Instead what he does, what he did after the Paris terror attack, what he did after San Bernardino, is he goes on television and he lectures Americans about Islamophobia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Enough is enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How about a president that actually stands up and defends this country?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need a commander-in-chief…,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"So what does that mean, patrol Muslim neighborhoods?",0,0,0,0,0,0
What it means is that we target the enemy.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, there is a difference between Islam and Islamism.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Islamism is a political and theocratic philosophy that commands its adherents to wage violent jihad, to murder or to forcibly convert all infidels.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"And by infidels, they mean every one of the rest of us.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Islamism is our enemy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when President Obama and Hillary Clinton and the modern Democratic Party play this politically correct game of denying it, it means they don’t fight it effectively.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So, for example, let’s talk about the consequences of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Obama and Hillary both advocate bringing tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Right, so you want to stop that, but you did talk about patrolling Muslim neighborhoods.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Sure, absolutely.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And a lot of folks — you kept saying that worked in New York, but political correctness made the police stop that.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
New York Police have pushed back on that.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Chief Bratton said that’s just complete bunk.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And I want to read you what, in fact — I mean, the guy who ran that program that you say was such a big success says it didn’t lead to any prosecutions, there were no leads from it.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Listen, you are right that after I called for increased vigilance protecting us that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and New York’s Mayor Bill de Blasio all attacked me.",0,0,0,1,1,0
I wear that as a badge of pride.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will not apologize to anyone…,0,0,0,0,0,0
"… Bill Bratton, worked for Rudy Giuliani…",0,0,0,0,0,0
I understand that the Commissioner who works for Bill de Blasio has a political imperative.,0,0,0,0,0,0
de Blasio is a left-wing radical.,0,0,0,1,0,0
The commander who oversaw the very program that you claim was as success in New York testified under oath that it didn’t lead to any investigations in the six years.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Anderson, in New York, this was a successful program….",0,0,0,0,0,0
…  In what way?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was set up under Mayor Michael Bloomberg to monitor and to work cooperatively with the Muslim community to prevent radicalization, and to stop radical Islamic terrorism plots before it occurs…",0,0,0,0,1,0
…  Can you name one case…,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are a number of cases.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It identified a bookstore that was a locus for radicalization and allowed law enforcement to after that bookstore, and what happened was when Mayor Bill de Blasio got elected he gave in to political correctness and shut the unit down.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Listen, if you want to stop radical Islamic terrorism, the answer isn’t to go hang out in random neighborhoods.",0,0,0,1,0,0
It is instead to focus on communities where radicalization is a risk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, I’ll tell you what Europe has done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Europe has followed the path that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to put us on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That the tragedies, these terror attacks in Europe are a result of failed immigration policies where they’ve allowed vast numbers of Islamic terrorists to come into Europe, and they’re in communities that are isolated.",0,0,1,1,1,1
They’re called “No-Go” communities where the law enforcement doesn’t engage in those communities.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"One in Brussels, Molenbeek, has been a particular incubator for radical Islamic terrorism.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Many of these terrorist plots trace back to Molenbeek.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"My plan is very simple, America should not make the mistakes of Europe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We should not disengage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We should have law enforcement actively engage to stop radicalization before it stops — and, I recognize that the media and the Democrats hate it when someone actually describes who the enemy is.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I’ll tell ya’, as President, every single day I will wake up fighting radical Islamic terrorism and working to defeat it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Turning back to the campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s obviously been a very rough and tumble week between you and Donald Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A salacious story about you was published in “National Enquirer”.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You say Donald Trump, the people around him, were responsible for planting that story.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Do you have any proof of that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There’s the story, on its face, quoted on the record, Roger Stone.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Former advisor to…,0,0,0,0,0,0
…  Roger Stone has been Donald Trump’s Chief Political adviser.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"He planned and ran his presidential campaign, and he’s been his hatchet man.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He spent 40 years as a hatchet man.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, not only that, the head of the “National Enquirer”, a guy named David Pecker, is good friends with Donald Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But you don’t know it for a fact that Donald Trump planted that story?,0,0,0,1,0,0
Of course I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When his good friend — you know, the “National Enquirer”, in its history, has never endorsed a presidential candidate until Donald Trump?",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And, now, David Pecker — look, Donald Trump suggested David Pecker, the head of the “National Enquirer”, should take over “Time” Magazine.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Who in their right mind should suggest the head of the “National Enquirer” should take over “Time” magazine?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You’ve been very tough recently, but early on the campaign it seemed like you made a political calculation not to go after him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just last week on a radio program, you said that essentially those candidates who did go after him early on were road kill, you needed to build your base.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Back in December you tweeted, “The establishment’s only hope, Trump and me in a cage match, sorry to disappoint, Donald Trump is terrific.”",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That was after he’d already made fun of Carly Fiorina’s face, after he’d gone after Megyn Kelly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"At that point in December, did you really believe Donald Trump was terrific?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, what I knew was that the media was engaged in a love fest.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Giving Donald Trump $2 billion dollars in premium (ph)…,0,0,1,1,1,1
…  Sounds like you were engaged in a love fest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let’s be clear, how many hours of free media do CNN, and FOX, and every other station — you let him call in, and for a year — $2 billion dollars of free media…",1,0,1,1,1,1
"…  Well, I got to say, we’ve asked you for interviews pretty much every day, and you’ve declined every offer on my program…",0,0,0,1,1,1
"… Well, Anderson….",0,0,0,0,0,0
"…  So, you can come on any time…",0,0,0,0,0,0
…  I want to point out I’ve been inviting Donald Trump for several days to come and make this a debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He’s coming later, and he’s terrified to make it a debate because he doesn’t want to actually stand and have his record challenged.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But, when you called him terrific back in December, did you really believe that, or was that political calculation?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me make a point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There has been a distinction that I have followed throughout, which is that I keep the focus on issues and substance, so I’m happy to draw distinction with Donald Trump on the issues, whether it is economic policy — that he doesn’t have a policy to bring jobs back to America, whether it is national security where is advocating for a far too weak foreign policy that leaves us vulnerable.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"What I’m not interested in doing is what Donald’s pattern has been, which is the personal attacks.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"It’s going to the gutter, it’s attacking family members.",0,0,0,1,0,0
None of that has any place in politics.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We ought to be discussing tax policy, we ought to be discussing national security.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We ought to be discussing substance…,0,0,0,0,0,0
…  Let’s do that now…,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
…  Not engaging in mudslinging…,0,0,0,0,0,0
… Let’s go to our first member of the audience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is Thomas Dougherty (ph).,0,0,0,0,0,1
He’s a student from Brookfield (ph) who says he’s still making up his mind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So you could pick up a vote here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thomas, welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hey, Thomas.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hi, Senator Cruz.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"My question for you is, how and why does your religion play a part in your political decision-making?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Don’t you think it should be more of a moral belief and not something that can interfere with your decision-making when you’re making decisions for all religions in the United States?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Thomas, thank you for that question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Listen, with Me, as with many people in America, my faith is an integral part of who I am.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m a Christian, and I’m not embarrassed to say that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m not going to hide that and treat it like it’s something you can’t admit publicly and acknowledge.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s an important part of who you are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I also think those in politics have an obligation not to wear their faith on their sleeve.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There have been far too many politicians that run around behaving like they’re holier than thou.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And I’ll tell you, my attitude as a voter when some politician stands up and says, I’m running because God told me to vote — to run, my reaction as a voter is, great, when God tells me to vote for you, we’ll be on the same page.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so, listen, I’m not asking you to vote for me because of my personal faith with Jesus Christ.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m asking you to vote for me because I’ve spent a lifetime fighting to defend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, fighting to defend the American free enterprise system, and we need a leader who will stand up every day and protect the rights of everyone, whether they’re Christians  or Jews or Muslims or anyone else.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The bill of rights protects all Americans.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It protects atheists.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"That’s the beauty of the bill of rights, is that we have the freedom to seek out god, to worship and to live according to our faith and our conscience, and I think the Constitution and Bill of Rights is a unifying principle that can bring us together across faiths, across races, across ethnicity.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And we need to come together behind the unifying principles that built America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you for your question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want you to meet — this is Tim Matson (ph).,0,0,0,0,0,0
"His son, Jordan, traveled to Jordan in 2014, fought alongside Kurdish forces that were taking on ISIS.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Tim says he is undecided.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Tim, welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, when Jordan left for Syria, I was furious with him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I couldn’t understand how he could do this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But then I followed his steps on the internet, and I saw the mass murders and beheadings, sometimes of young children, and I understood.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now I know we can’t be police of the world, but there’s lines that have been crossed that no civilized nation should ignore.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have a nation that’s often said, never again, but there again, here we are.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So as commander in chief, will you send an overwhelming force with unrestricted use of power to obliterate ISIS and send a message to those who want to do evil upon the innocents of their fate (ph) if they do this?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, Tim, thank you for that question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And thank you for your son, Jordan, serving, and thank you for his sacrifice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, the question of when to commit U.S. armed forces to combat is the most serious decision any president can make.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I believe the decision to use military force should be keyed to the vital national security interest of this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Far too often we’ve seen in the last seven years where President Obama has not focused on our national security interests.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, for example, we saw in Libya, Moammar Gadhafi, the dictator there, was a bad man.",0,0,1,1,0,1
He had a horrible human rights record.,0,0,1,1,0,1
He had been a state sponsor of terrorists.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"But Gadhafi in his latter years had actually shaped up his conduct pretty dramatically in response to U.S. strength and had become an active participant working with America stopping radical Islamic terrorists — tracking them down, apprehending them, handing them over to us.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"And what President Obama and Hillary Clinton did is they ended up joining with and leading many world forces in toppling Gadhafi, ultimately killing Gadhafi.",0,0,0,0,1,0
And the consequence in Libya is that country was handed over to radical Islamic terrorists.,0,0,0,1,1,1
It’s become a war zone of battling war lords.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And…,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The question is about U.S. troops, though, U.S. forces on the ground to defeat ISIS.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I understand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I’m answering the question, Anderson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was an enormous mistake.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And the reason they made the mistake is they weren’t focused on U.S. national security interests.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"They were in the interests of promoting democracy, and toppling a government that ends up handing it over to radical Islamic terrorists is a much worse outcome.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"We saw a similar thing in Egypt, where Obama and Hillary both cheered the toppling of Hosni Mubarak, the head of Egypt.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Egypt was handed over to the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Morsi.",0,0,0,0,1,1
The Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization.,0,0,0,1,1,1
That was profoundly harmful for U.S. national security interests.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Thankfully president el-Sisi is now in charge of Egypt.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now with regard to Syria, Assad is a monster.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I agree with you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He’s a horrible man.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own citizens.,0,0,1,1,1,1
He has murdered women.,0,0,1,1,1,0
He has murdered children.,0,0,1,1,1,0
He has used chemical weapons against them.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"But the problem is, if we simply topple Assad, the most likely outcome is that ISIS takes over Syria.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And handing Syria over to ISIS, to radical Islamic terrorists who are waging war with us is a mistake.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"So your question of what we should do, our focus, I believe, in Syria should not be on toppling Assad.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our focus should be on utterly and completely destroying ISIS, because ISIS is our enemy and ISIS has declared war on America and they pose a direct threat to our national security interests.",0,0,1,1,1,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"In order to topple ISIS, would you be — I mean, his question is sending an overwhelming ground force.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Would you be willing to send U.S. troops on the ground?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not just Special Forces as is currently being done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I will do whatever is necessary militarily to defeat ISIS.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, defeating ISIS is going to have a lot of components.",0,0,0,0,0,0
One of the most important components is overwhelming air power.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"You’ve talked about carpet bombing and just recently you said “carpet bomb them into oblivion.” Lieutenant General Charles Brown Jr., who is the commander of U.S. Air Forces, Central Command,  said carpet bombing is not effective for the operation that we’re actually executing because we’re using precision-guided munitions on a regular basis and, in fact, carpet bombing civilian areas is a violation of the Geneva Conventions.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Nobody has talked about targeting civilian areas.,0,0,0,0,1,1
What I have suggested we should do is use overwhelming air power.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And let me — let’s talk some specifics and some facts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What does carpet bombing mean?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m trying to answer your question, Anderson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK.  Just for a fact, ISIS is in many civilian areas.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Let’s talk specific facts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The first Persian Gulf War, a little over 25 years ago, we were launching roughly 1,100 air attacks a day.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We were using overwhelming airpower.,0,0,0,1,1,0
It’s one of the great strengths of the tremendous American military is our air superiority is second to none.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Right now, today, Obama is launching between 15 and 30 air attacks a day.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Right, but…",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Compare the — but hold on, let me make my point, please, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you compare those two numbers, 1,100 air attacks a day, we did that for 37 days, and then our troops went in and in a day-and-a-half mopped up what was left of the Iraqi army.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Eleven hundred air attacks a day does crushing debilitating damage.,0,0,1,1,0,1
Fifteen to 30 a day is photo-op foreign policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I’ve talked to commanders who actually did the air campaign who said, look, it’s easy when you’re trying to take out — not easy, but it’s one thing when you are trying take out a government’s military, you can bomb their military-industrial complex, you can bomb factories, you can bomb their centers of command and control, you can bomb barracks.",0,0,0,0,0,1
ISIS is a completely different kind of enemy.,0,0,0,1,0,1
But you can use all of those tools.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So you can take out their command and control headquarters.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can take out their communication.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You can take out their means of transportation, ingress and egress.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You can take out their oil fields.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can take out their oil refining capacity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can take out their infrastructure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can target their troops and their troop movements.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we’re not doing that right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Overwhelming airpower is the first step, now it’s not the only step, but overwhelming airpower is the first step.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The next step is arming the Kurds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Kurds, the Peshmerga, fighting forces of the Kurds are very, very effective fighters.",0,0,0,1,1,0
They’re longtime allies of America.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They’re fighting ISIS right now.,0,0,0,1,1,0
ISIS is using U.S. military equipment that they seized in Iraq.,0,0,1,1,1,1
The Kurds are using outmoded equipment and the Obama administration refuses to arm them because of political reasons.,0,0,0,1,1,1
That doesn’t make sense.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We ought to be arming the Kurds and let them kill ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And then beyond that the question of Special Forces and ground troops.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We should do whatever is necessary to win, but I’ll tell you what I won’t do is I will not send our troops into combat the way Barack Obama is doing with rules of engagement so strict that they cannot fight, they cannot win, and they cannot defeat the enemy.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"If we’re going to use our troops, we’re going to defeat the enemy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to go to our next questioner.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is Shannon O’Connell.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She works in health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She’s an independent voter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She says she is still undecided.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Shannon, welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hi, Shannon.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My question is more personal in nature.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What would you regard as your greatest personal failure and what did you learn from it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, those are always — whether in political campaign or a job interview, those are always tricky questions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, any time you go for a job interview, you sit down and you’re like, OK, what’s your greatest weakness?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, like, the classic answer people give at a job interview, you know, my greatest weakness is I just work too hard.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m just such a disciplined employee, I just put my work in front of everything else.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, there are pros and cons to it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What I will say is I’m a pretty driven guy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That has pros and cons.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have always been a very driven guy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"… I’m just such a disciplined employee, I just put my work in front of everything else.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, there are pros and cons to it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What I will say is I’m a pretty driven guy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That has pros and cons.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have always been a very driven guy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe passionately in free-market principles and the Constitution.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My whole life — I mean, when I was a teenager, I studied and memorized a shortened mnemonic (ph) version of the Constitution and traveled around as part of a non-profit organization in Houston speaking about the Constitution, speaking about free-market principles.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, you know, a lot of that, I think the reason that I’m so driven on this front has to do with my family background.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"My father was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba, and when my dad came to America, he had nothing, and it really is — it’s an amazing thing when you grow up in the house with someone who’s fled oppression, because I remember when I was a little kid, we’d be watching TV, and there was an urgency to politics.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It wasn’t, oh, that’s interesting, a couple of candidates.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"It was, having principled men and women in office is how you protect yourself from tyranny.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I’ll confess, growing up in a Cuban-American household, you’re raised where there are two families — there are two parties.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The Republicans and the Communists.,0,0,0,1,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
And anyone who is Cuban-American will understand I’m not kidding really with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I was really saddened to see Barack Obama go and pal around with the Castros and pose under a Che Guevera picture.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, it drove that point home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as a kid, that gives you an urgency.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so at times, listen, I’m hard charging.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That means I’ve stepped on some toes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That means I’ve been focused very hard on fighting those fights, and maybe I should have pulled back in some circumstances.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So it is a strength and a weakness.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will say this, I am someone who what you see is what you get.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what I’m going to do in office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s what I’ve done every day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s what I believe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s what I’ve spent my life fighting for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think we’re at a time where we need a president who we know what he will do, and we know we can trust them to follow through on what they’re saying.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you for your question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is William Wake (ph).,0,0,0,0,0,0
He’s got one of the toughest jobs I think there is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He’s a middle school social studies teacher.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He says he’s leaning toward voting for you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
William?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Cruz…,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Follow your instincts, William.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"My students will often ask me, you know, they’ll say, have you seen or heard what the candidates are saying?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And oftentimes it’s not about substance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It’s about, you know, what name we’ve been calling each other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I guess my question is, is it a good example to set for our youth of America, and should we stay on substance instead of calls each other names?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, William, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you for the difference you make teaching kids and teaching in middle school.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, middle school is obviously just a really pivotal age.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I worry about that question, what lesson to our kids take watching this?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Heidi and I, our girls are 5 and 7.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they’re watching presidential candidates insulting each other, yelling, cursing, attacking family members.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I mean, it’s gotten really ugly, and just when you don’t think it can get any uglier, it gets uglier.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that has no place in politics, and my view — I have no ability to control what another candidate does.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But what I can control is my approach.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’ll tell you the promise that I made to the people who joined our campaign from the beginning, the supporters who were with us from the beginning.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, listen, I can’t promise we’re going to win, I think we will, but I can promise you two things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One, we’re going to work every day with a joyful spirit, we’re going to work every day and put everything weave into this campaign., and number two, we’re going to do so with integrity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re not going to go into the gutter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re not going to attack people personally.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re not going to malign their character.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to focus on issues and substance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now in the course of the campaign, there have been a bunch of candidates engaging in personal insults.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I’ve worked very, very hard to stay out of that and say, I’m not going into the gutter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you attack me personally, I’m not going to respond in kind.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, if you want to talk about your tax plan, I’ll compare my tax plan to your tax plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That should be the bread and butter of politics.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it is my hope that at the end of the day that that is the approach that prevails.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it’s what the people of Wisconsin want.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it’s what the people of America want.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Over here we have Jason Vorpel (ph).,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He’s a dairy farmer from Random Lake, Wisconsin.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"He says he’s voting for you, Senator Cruz — Jason.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Jason.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am a dairy farmer here in Wisconsin, and dairy farming in my family goes back to the 1800s when my great-great grandparents starting farming with six cows.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Today we have 2,800 cows.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Wow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it’s a 24-hour operation.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We offer a competitive wage and offer full benefits to all our employees.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Most farms in the dairy industry cannot find American-born workers to milk the cows and take care of them.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"The only ones willing to do this hard work are Latino immigrants who, if we didn’t have them for eight hours, there would be a crisis across the country in our industry.",0,0,0,0,1,1
What is the short-term solution to keep our current labor force intact?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what is the long-term solution moving forward?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, thank you for sharing your experience as a dairy farmer, and, you know, there are farmers across this country who are really hurting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And farmers are hurting from a lot of things.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They’re hurting from a federal government whose policies have been making it harder and harder for farmers to survive.,0,0,0,1,0,1
They’re hurting from an EPA who is imposing massive burdens on farms.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"For example, the Waters of the United States Rule where the EPA has tried to define a puddle or a drainage ditch on your farm to be navigable waters and thus subject to massive environmental regulations.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And I think we need a president, we need an administration that takes the burdens off farmers so that it is easier to do your job which is incredibly important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, when it comes to labor, I understand the need to have labor and that it can be hard to have agricultural labor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I’ll tell you, though, one of the consequences of our immigration system right now, when we’ve got 12 million people who are here illegally, that has an effect of driving down wages for Americans across this country.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"There was a very interesting article, it was about, oh, a month, maybe six weeks ago in The Wall Street Journal, it was focusing on Arizona.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You’ll recall several years ago Arizona put in place really tough laws on illegal immigration.,0,0,0,1,1,1
And they were criticized loudly for putting those laws in place.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"And it was interesting, this Wall Street Journal article, because it talked about what happened in the wake of that law, which is a great many of the illegal immigrants left.",0,0,0,1,1,1
They left the state and went elsewhere.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And it actually quoted a farmer, and that’s the reason I’m bringing up this example, it quoted a farmer, a fellow in Arizona who was growing peppers.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And he complained, he said, listen, all people that we had picking peppers, they left.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"And he said, I didn’t know what to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn’t  know that we were going to be able to pick our peppers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what it described that he did is he actually went and invented a new tool to help pick the peppers.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And then he went down to the local community college and he ended up hiring Americans coming out of the community college.,0,0,1,0,0,1
He had to pay them more.,0,0,1,0,1,0
He paid them about $15 an hour.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"But he continues picking his peppers except he’s doing so in a situation where what has happened in Arizona, the public expenditures have plummeted.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Arizona is spending hundreds of millions of dollars less on prisons, on education, on hospitals, for those here illegally.",0,0,1,1,1,1
That means that’s hundreds of millions of dollars available to take care of U.S. citizens.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And also unemployment has gone down and median wages for Americans have gone up in the construction industry, carpenters.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We’re seeing wages going up.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And I think the view — our immigration laws should benefit American workers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That should be the focus of immigration laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so what I intend to do as president is, number one, we’re going to secure the border.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to end illegal immigration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We know how to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what’s missing is the political will to get it done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The difference is I will get it done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But beyond that, when it comes to legal immigration, listen, I think on immigration the principles are really simple.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Legal, good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Illegal, bad.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It’s amazing how many — how many folks in politics, how many folks in the media have trouble understanding that.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I’m reminded, you guys remember former Congressman Sonny Bono from “Sonny & Cher”?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Years ago Sonny Bono was asked, what’s your view on illegal immigration?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said, well, it’s illegal, isn’t it?",0,0,0,1,1,1
We’re going to solve this problem by securing the border and ending illegal immigration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And once we do that, that’s going to drive up wages for Americans across this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in the agriculture world, I think the first option should be trying to find American workers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Now that may mean wages come up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It may mean that we have to use more tools.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ve seen in Arizona that has happened.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And beyond that, our legal immigration system, if there are needs in the labor force and American workers not available to do it, that’s where legal immigration should come in.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But it should be in a situation where you’re vetting the people rather than just having people come in that we don’t know who they are, and we don’t know their criminal history, we don’t know their background.",0,0,0,1,0,0
It should be through the legal system targeted in a way that protects American workers.,0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to have more with Senator Cruz in just a moment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to take a short break.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Also ahead tonight in Milwaukee, John Kasich and Donald Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"We’re here at the Riverside Theater in downtown Milwaukee, taking voter questions for Senator Ted Cruz.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"John Kasich, Donald Trump coming up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But more voter questions now for Senator Cruz.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to start, though — more than six months ago, you pledged to support the Republican nominee.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"When things started getting rough with Donald Trump, you said you were going to stick with that pledge because you’d given your word.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I saw in an interview with my colleague, Sunlen Serfaty – I think it was just yesterday.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You’re said you’re not in a habit of supporting people who attack your wife and attack your family.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do you still stand by the pledge to support whoever the nominee, even if it’s Donald Trump?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Anderson, as you mentioned, what I said is true.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m not in the habit of supporting someone who attacks my wife and attacks my family.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that is going beyond the line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think our wives, I think our kids should be off limits.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They don’t belong in the attacks.,0,0,1,1,1,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, listen, I’m not an easy person to tick off, but when you go after my wife, when you go after my daughters, that does it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think — I want this race to stay focused on policy and issues and solutions to the real problems facing America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s where I’m going to stay focused.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if other candidates don’t, I think that’s beyond the pale.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So I just have to follow-up, if Donald Trump is the GOP nominee, would you support him?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me tell you my solution to that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald is not going to be the GOP nominee.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We’re going to beat him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I would be remiss if I didn’t follow-up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s my greatest failing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was the question earlier for you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"My greatest failing is sometimes I don’t follow up, so not to give into that, I mean, I got to ask, I will assume by you saying  you would not support him, that the answer is you would not support him if he is the nominee?",0,0,0,1,0,0
I gave you my answer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Listen, I think nominating Donald Trump would be an absolute train wreck.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it would hand the general election to Hillary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Poll after poll after poll shows Donald Trump losing 10, 11, 12 points or more.",0,0,0,1,1,1
I don’t want to see the White House given over to Hillary Clinton.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I don’t want to see us lose the Senate and House, lose the Supreme Court for a generation, lose the Bill of Rights.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"I think nominating Donald Trump is a disaster, and so the answer to that is not to scream and yell and cry and attack him, the answer to that is to beat him at the ballot box.",0,0,0,1,0,0
That’s what we’re working every day to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s what we’re campaigning every day here in Wisconsin to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is Benjamin Miller.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He’s a student at University of Wisconsin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He says he’s also voting for you next week.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Benjamin, welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Good evening, senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Benjamin, welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Both Paris and now Brussels have suffered blindside attacks by Islamic terrorists.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Although I fear a terrorist attack on the United States, I have a greater fear of the government taking away my constitutional freedoms and privacy in the name of security.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As president, how will you ensure that America is not blindly attacked, while also maintaining the privacy of the American people?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Benjamin, thank you for that question, and it’s a very important question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, there are some in politics who say it’s an either/or choice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We can either protect America or protect our civil liberties.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t accept that choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it is possible to walk and chew gum at the same time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it is possible — and the difference — something the Obama administration is not very good at — they’re not very good at distinguishing between bad guys and good guys.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So over and over again, the Obama administration’s solution, for example, when it comes to surveillance, was to monitor the phone calls or the e-mails of millions of law-abiding citizens, but because of their political correctness, because they won’t focus on and identify radical Islamic terrorists, they don’t actually target the bad guys.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"It’s why it’s so important — and you know, it’s interesting, Benjamin, people in the media, sometimes they ask, why does it matter whether Obama will say the words “radical Islamic terrorism?”  It matters because if you don’t identify the problem, you don’t devote — you don’t direct law enforcement and national security resources to stopping it.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I’ll give a specific example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My home state of Florida, Fort Hood, Nidal Hassan committed a horrific terrorist attack there.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Now, the  Obama administration knew before the attack that Nidal Hassan communicated with Anwar Al Awlaki, a known radical Islamic cleric.",0,0,0,1,1,1
They knew that Nidal Hassan had asked about the permissibility of waging jihad and murdering his fellow soldiers.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And yet for whatever reason, political correctness or what have you, they didn’t do anything.",0,0,0,1,0,0

"Let me start with a simple question, but maybe a complicated answer.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How do you win?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Clinton has basically declared herself the nominee, the math is certainly very much in her favor.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Explain to me how you're the nominee in July in your head.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fair question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think there are three paths to victory.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, I want to go into the convention with more pledged delegates than Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's going to be an uphill fight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because for 270 or so delegates, and we’ve got 46 percent of the pledged delegates.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"What I want to do, and I think we can, is win California here, and win under the big vote, do very, very well in the other five states.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Senator, in your answer there, you're basically contradicting yourself on the issue of superdelegates in this way: you're saying you want them to respect the vote in their state, then at the same time, you say, ""But oh, by the way, for those of you that are a superdelegate in a state that Clinton won, why don't you think about the general election?""",0,0,0,1,0,1

We have to talk about the bigger issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And this is what do the people really feel.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The politicians are not keeping their promises, and politicians don't solve the problems.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And this is why you see in our poll numbers that 69 percent of the people say, ""The politicians have to work together.""",0,0,0,0,1,1
That is the most important thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Democrats, of course, still locked in their primary battle.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Republicans starting to get behind their nominee.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Meaning, Bernie Sanders supporters aren't coming home to the Democrats?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well if history's any guide, we think that's what it is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Clinton should pick up about 70 percent of the current people right now that say they're for Sanders against Trump but not yet ready to vote for Clinton.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Call them the Sanders-only voters.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll show you what they could mean.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's start with our latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We see a close race between Clinton and Trump, 46-43, that's margin of error stuff.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"While Sanders, double-digit lead against Trump, 54-39.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"It's an eight-point gap between Clinton and Sanders, so what happens if Clinton gets about 70 percent of that difference if you leave Trump's number as is.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Well, Clinton's lead would jump five points to 51-43.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Same phenomenon in other polls.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"CBS/New York Times, they have Clinton starting with a six-point lead over Trump, they of course had Sanders up double digits as well, 51-38.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"But if you shift the support from Sanders, Clinton would pick up another three points, and the lead would increase to nine, 50-41.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Finally, we'll show you what happens in the Fox News poll, where Clinton actually trailed Trump by three points, 45-42, Sanders led Trump in their poll, 46-42.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Well, you do the same thing, 70 percent of those Sanders-only voters, Clinton would poll even, to 45-45.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"The point is, Sanders is hurting Clinton right now.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"By the way, in 2008, Barack Obama picked up, you guessed it, three points against John McCain in the first NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll after Hillary Clinton dropped out.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Look, the polls between Clinton and Trump are tight right now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not a surprise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it gives you an idea that if Democrats do rally around their nominee, what the race may look like just before the conventions begin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll see if that actually happens though.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sanders supporters don't seem ready to move just yet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll be back in a moment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me bring the panel back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, the biggest political story of the month may be taking place right now in Orlando, the Libertarian Party Convention.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Don't laugh, I know, because their place on the ballot, they could be ""none of the above,"" if that's possible.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And in fact, we noted, we actually put a battleground map together of what would happen if you have a third-party candidacy like the Libertarians who can get 10 percent.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"So here's the initial battleground map, here the states that we know will be in play no matter what, those are in purple there, ten states in there.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If the Libertarians can get ten, we think these three red states, Arizona, Missouri, and Indiana, suddenly come into play perhaps for Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then we've got two blue states to put in Minnesota and Maine, under the same scenario that those are states that suddenly get put into play for Trump.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Jerry, do you think the Libertarians are going to make a splash this year?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think they could.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As you know, in our polling, Wall Street Journal/NBC News, or NBC News/Wall Street Journal as you call it, we found that there were so many respondents asked about a choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump who were responding, ""I won't vote in that race,"" that we had to create a new answer.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"If those people find someplace else to go, even if it's only to make a statement, it could be a significant enough number to tip some states.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that matters.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Kellyanne, are you nervous about the Libertarians hurting Trump?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Yes, because I think Hillary Clinton can get to 43, 44 percent before she gets out of bed in the morning, but getting her to 51 percent in a two-person race seems to be roiling her.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So yes, if they grab some votes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But this convention, based on the public reports, I mean, Bill Welds as vice president running mates has had a hard time,"" he's confusing Libertarian with liberal Republicans.",0,0,0,1,0,1

He could.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I was on Capitol Hill this week, he talked to some members of the House and Republican senators.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they were inching close to the idea of maybe supporting the Libertarian ticket.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But then they watched these candidates, they watched this convention, and they realized it's an imperfect vessel.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And this is a problem for many of these never-Trump Republicans.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They’re considering Libertarian but they just don't fit into that culture.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Neera, where do you think this sort of neither, the none-of-the-above vote goes?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Does it go to greens and Libertarians and sort of split?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do they not show up?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Does turnout actually go down, not up?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think actually a lot of the negativity of this race is designed to lower turnout.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think that's actually Trump's strategy, to be so negative about everything that he actually lowers Democratic turnout.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"But I think, look, going into this race, it's a crazy year.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So if it's not Johnson and somebody else, I think that still could attract some Republicans, even though you would think that some of these statements would disqualify them.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You know, we shouldn't forget, there's another place the none-of-the-above vote can go, and that's to the Green party.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that some of the Sanders voters could drift there, just again, to make a statement.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's a potential problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, we have a history there with Democrats, which is Ralph Nader.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And a lot of people feel like Ralph Nader actually is turning the election towards--that Republicans don't have.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Because you look at Trump as a non-interventionist on foreign policy, and some of those Ron Paul, Rand Paul supporters have drifted toward Trump because they see the main Republican party as too hawkish.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Actually, Kellyanne, I could make an argument he’s more -- Trump would be more comfortable in the Libertarian party than he would in the Republican.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, but that's because the Libertarians are comfortable with Trump as their nominee.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think they will be.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's get right to it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The first topic is the Supreme Court.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have two minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you very much, Chris.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?",0,0,0,0,0,1
What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What kind of rights will Americans have?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.",0,0,0,1,1,1
I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.,1,0,0,1,0,0
"But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I look forward to having that opportunity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Secretary Clinton, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, same question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Where do you want to see the court take the country?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.",0,0,0,1,1,0
And she was forced to apologize.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And apologize she did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.",1,0,0,1,0,1
"But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They will have a conservative bent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They will be protecting the Second Amendment.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I believe that's very, very important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And those are the people that I will appoint.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, ""The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.""",0,0,0,1,1,1
"And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision.,0,0,0,0,0,1
What's wrong with that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,1,0
I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I represented upstate New York.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It goes back to the founding of our country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.",1,1,0,0,1,1
"I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.",0,0,0,1,0,0
There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You mentioned the Heller decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.",0,0,0,1,1,1
So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me bring Mr. Trump in here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got.",0,0,0,0,1,1
How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.",0,0,1,1,0,0
I watched.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And Justice Scalia was so involved.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it was a well-crafted decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry.",0,0,1,1,0,0
And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Were you extremely upset?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.",0,0,0,0,1,0
The gun lobby's on his side.,0,0,0,0,1,0
They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines.",0,0,0,1,1,1
You support a national right to carry law.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Why, sir?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.",0,1,1,1,1,0
I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.,0,0,1,0,1,1
So I'm very honored by all of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you're pro-life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion?",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm asking you specifically.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Would you like to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is about what's happening right now in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.,0,0,0,0,1,0
He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.,0,1,1,1,1,0
I will defend Planned Parenthood.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton…,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have come too far to have that turned back now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions.",1,1,1,1,1,1
And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, your reaction?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think it's terrible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.",0,1,1,0,1,0
"Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.",0,1,1,0,0,0
And that's not acceptable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that is not what happens in these cases.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I do not believe the government should be making it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will stand up for that right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Nobody has that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's move on to the subject of immigration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you want to build a wall.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you go first in this segment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have two minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.",0,0,1,1,1,0
We need strong borders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.",0,0,1,1,1,1
You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They're coming in illegally.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Drugs are pouring in through the border.,0,0,0,1,1,1
We have no country if we have no border.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary wants to give amnesty.,1,0,1,0,1,0
She wants to have open borders.,1,0,1,0,1,0
"The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.",0,0,1,0,1,1
First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It means their job is tougher.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But they know what's going on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They know it better than anybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They want strong borders.,0,0,0,0,1,0
They feel we have to have strong borders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was up in New Hampshire the other day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.",0,0,0,1,0,0
All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.,1,0,0,1,1,1
It's just pouring and destroying their youth.,1,0,0,1,0,0
It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to have strong borders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to keep the drugs out of our country.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We need strong borders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, I want to build the wall.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need the wall.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We stop the drugs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We shore up the border.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Same question to you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you're right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to rip families apart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to be sending parents away from children.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We have 11 million undocumented people.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.",0,0,0,0,1,1
He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.,1,0,1,1,1,1
"Now, here's what that means.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.",0,0,1,1,0,0
I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I have been for border security for years.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I voted for border security in the United States Senate.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Didn't even raise it.,0,0,1,0,1,0
He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.,0,0,1,1,1,1
So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to follow up...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Chris, I think it's...",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think I should respond to that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Very nice man.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Believe me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.",0,1,1,0,1,1
It's a disaster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.,1,0,1,1,1,0
Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.",0,0,1,1,0,1
But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"Well, let me -- wait, wait, sir, let me...",0,0,0,0,0,0
We are a country of laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We either have -- and by the way...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, wait.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to hear from...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well -- well, but she said one thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I voted for border security, and there are...",0,0,0,0,1,0
And the wall.,0,0,1,0,0,0
There are some limited places where that was appropriate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And Donald knows a lot about this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported.""",0,1,1,1,1,1
"I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.",0,0,1,1,0,0
Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0
President Obama has moved millions of people out.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.",0,0,1,0,1,1
They've been deported.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.",0,0,0,0,0,0
As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're a country of laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We either have a border or we don't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it's very unfair.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have millions of people that did it the right way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're on line.,0,0,0,0,1,0
They're waiting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.",0,1,0,1,1,1
"You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I want to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.,0,1,1,0,1,1
"Secretary Clinton, I want to...",0,0,0,0,0,0
We will not have open borders.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That is...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me -- Secretary...",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is a rank mischaracterization.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And this used to be a bipartisan issue.,0,0,0,1,1,0
Ronald Reagan was the last president...,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Secretary Clinton, excuse me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote.",0,0,0,1,1,1
My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.,0,1,0,0,0,1
So that's the question...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Please quiet, everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Is that your dream, open borders?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined.",0,1,0,0,1,1
"And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that would be a great benefit to us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Those are the questions we need answered.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Well?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?",0,0,0,0,1,0
How did we get on to Putin?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hold on -- hold on, wait.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hold on, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because we -- this is going to end up getting out of control.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's try to keep it quiet so -- for the candidates and for the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So just to finish on the borders...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes?,0,0,0,0,0,0
She wants open borders.,0,0,1,0,1,0
People are going to pour into our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People are going to come in from Syria.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.",1,0,1,1,1,1
They have no idea where they come from.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.",0,0,1,0,1,0
Now we can talk about Putin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't know Putin.,1,0,1,0,1,0
He said nice things about me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we got along well, that would be good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He has no respect for her.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He has no respect for our president.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And she's playing chicken.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, Putin...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wait, but...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"from everything I see, has no respect for this person.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
No puppet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
No puppet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's pretty clear...,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're the puppet!,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's pretty clear you won't admit...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, you're the puppet.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.",1,1,0,1,1,0
So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.",1,1,1,1,1,1
I find that deeply disturbing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's time you take a stand...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.",0,1,1,1,0,0
I am not quoting myself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She has no idea.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I am quoting 17...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary, you have no idea.",0,0,0,1,0,0
17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...,0,0,0,1,0,0
And our country has no idea.,0,0,1,1,0,0
agencies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, I doubt it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I doubt it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I find that just absolutely...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.,0,0,1,0,1,0
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
He's outsmarted her every step of the way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do get to ask some questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, that's fine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I would like to ask you this direct question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?",0,0,0,1,0,0
By Russia or anybody else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You condemn their interference?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course I condemn.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course I -- I don't know Putin.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I have no idea.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm not asking -- I'm asking do you condemn?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I never met Putin.,0,0,1,0,1,0
This is not my best friend.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whether it's Syria, you name it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Missiles.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"They create warheads, and we can't.",0,0,1,1,0,1
The Russians can't believe it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
She has been outsmarted by Putin.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They've taken over.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We've spent $6 trillion.,0,0,0,0,1,1
They've taken over the Middle East.,0,0,1,0,0,1
She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"We're a long way away from immigration, but I'm going to let you finish this topic.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You got about 45 seconds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And she always will be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He's...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wrong.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.",1,1,1,0,1,0
"He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.",0,1,1,1,1,0
But here's the deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.",0,0,0,1,0,1
There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.",0,0,0,0,1,0
I have 200 generals...,0,0,0,0,1,0
Very quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We are spending a fortune doing it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They have the bargain of the century.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.",0,1,1,1,0,1
We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.,0,0,1,1,1,1
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways.",0,0,0,1,0,0
This is just another lie.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...",0,0,0,0,0,0
There's no quote.,0,1,1,0,0,0
You're not going to find a quote from me.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks.",0,1,0,0,1,0
That kind...,0,0,0,0,0,0
And defend yourselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
of language -- well...,0,0,0,0,0,0
And defend yourselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn't say nuclear.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And defend yourself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Donald wants to tear up our alliances.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to -- no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to drill down into this a little bit more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I want us to do more to help small business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.,0,0,1,0,1,1
So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.,0,1,1,0,1,1
"By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.",0,1,1,1,1,1
Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.",1,0,1,1,1,1
So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Secretary, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.",1,0,1,0,1,0
Her tax plan is a disaster.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And she can say all she wants about college tuition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm a big proponent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.",0,1,1,1,1,0
"But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We protect Saudi Arabia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why aren't they paying?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?,0,0,0,1,0,0
Because they weren't paying.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They have to pay up.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"We're protecting people, they have to pay up.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I'm a big fan of NATO.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But they have to pay up.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Believe me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.",0,0,0,1,1,1
But I think it's really an important issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.",0,0,0,0,0,0

She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.,1,1,0,0,0,0

I have a feeling how they came.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe it was her campaign that did it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?,0,0,0,0,0,0

He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.",1,0,1,1,1,0
Wrong.,1,0,1,0,0,0

So it's not one thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.",0,0,1,1,0,0
That is not who America is.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm not looking at anything now.,0,0,0,0,0,0

What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.,0,0,1,1,1,1
There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.,1,0,1,1,1,1
Should have gotten it.,0,0,0,0,0,0

OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So that is not the way our democracy works.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've been around for 240 years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We've had free and fair elections.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after?",0,0,0,1,0,0
And that's something that whichever of you ends up -- whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.",0,0,0,0,1,0

"I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.",0,0,0,1,0,0
The goal here is to take back Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to be a hard fight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've got no illusions about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.",0,0,0,1,1,1

"That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Mr. Trump, same question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will -- would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We had Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul.",0,0,1,0,1,0
Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.,0,0,0,0,1,0
The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul.",0,0,1,1,1,1

We announce we're going after Mosul.,0,0,0,0,1,0

The element of surprise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They want to look good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.",0,0,0,1,1,0
That's why we have the great migration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But she wanted to look good for the election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So they're going in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But who's going to get Mosul, really?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll take Mosul eventually.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Much, much tougher.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Much more dangerous.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Going to be more deaths that they thought.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They say, what do we need this for?",0,0,0,0,0,0
So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.",0,0,0,0,1,1
So we're now going to take Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Iran.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sir, your two minutes are up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.",1,0,1,1,1,1
I said it was a mistake.,1,0,0,1,0,0
I've said that years ago.,1,0,0,0,0,0
He has consistently denied what is...,1,0,0,1,1,0
Wrong.,0,0,1,0,0,0
a very clear fact that...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wrong.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"before the invasion, he supported it.",0,1,1,0,1,0
"And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Google ""Donald Trump Iraq.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.,0,1,0,1,1,1
Wrong.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, why does that matter?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mosul is a Sunni city.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Mosul is on the border of Syria.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" and we brought him to justice.",0,0,1,0,1,0
We need to go after the leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.,0,0,0,1,1,1
They've been digging underground.,0,0,1,1,0,1
They've been prepared to defend.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to be tough fighting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is what we have to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.",0,0,0,1,0,0

Take a look at it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered.",0,0,0,1,1,1
That's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they are being slaughtered...,0,0,0,1,1,1
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
because of bad decisions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I may just finish here, and you also said that -- that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"In fact, they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo.",0,0,1,1,1,1

"Well, Aleppo is a disaster.",0,0,0,0,0,0

It is so sad when you see what's happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Lots of luck, Hillary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thanks a lot for doing a great job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you have talked about -- and in the last debate and again today -- that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there.",0,0,0,1,1,1
President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you're going to get into a war -- his words -- with Syria and Russia.",0,0,0,1,1,1

I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This would not be done just on the first day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This would take a lot of negotiation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's made these claims repeatedly.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.",0,0,1,0,1,1

"And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Folks, I want to get into our final segment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I just have to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Real quick.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And right now, they're in 32 countries.",0,0,0,0,1,1
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We should have -- wait one second.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria.",0,0,0,0,0,0

They are outplayed.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Now, she wasn't there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I assume she had nothing to do with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran.",0,0,1,1,0,0
Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton -- no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That's the highest since just after World War II.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you go first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.",0,0,0,0,1,1
But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To do that, we're taking back jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It's very sad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We used to be there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've given it up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've become very, very sloppy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But we don't use those people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We use political hacks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So we have to use our great people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ""Make America Great Again,"" I wonder when he thought America was great.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I do not add a penny to the national debt.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"In fact, I think just the opposite.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's where growth will come from.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Could I just respond?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I disagreed with him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We should have been much tougher on trade even then.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've been waiting for years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody does it right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0

All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?",0,0,0,0,0,1
I'm cutting taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to grow the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not going to help in the entitlements.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Bad health care at the most expensive price.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I will not cut benefits.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.,0,0,1,1,1,1
That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.",0,0,0,0,1,1

"Nine months ago, our campaign began.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when it began, we had no political organization, no money, and not much name recognition outside of the state of Vermont.",0,0,1,1,1,1
A lot has happened in nine months.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And what has happened is, I think, the American people have responded to a series of basic truths, and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt, which is undermining American democracy, which allows Wall Street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And that's an economy where ordinary Americans are working longer hours for low wagers.,0,0,0,1,1,1
They are worried to death about the future of their kids.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent.,0,1,0,0,1,1
"And then in addition to that, the American people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"They see more people in jail in the United States of America than any other country on earth, 2.2 million.",0,0,1,1,1,1
We're spending $80 billion a year locking up fellow Americans.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"They see kids getting arrested for marijuana, getting in prison, getting a criminal record, while they see executives on Wall Street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all.",0,0,1,1,1,1
No criminal records for them.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"I think what our campaign is indicating is that the American people are tired of establishment politics, tired of establishment economics.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"They want a political revolution in which millions of Americans stand up, come together, not let the Trumps of the world divide us, and say, you know what, in this great country, we need a government that represents all of us, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.",0,0,0,0,0,1

Americans haven't had a raise in 15 years.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"There aren't enough good-paying jobs, especially for young people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And yes, the economy is rigged in favor of those at the top.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We both agree that we have to get unaccountable money out of our political system and that we have to do much more to ensure that Wall Street never wrecks main street again.,0,0,0,1,0,1

I think America can only live up to its potential when we make sure that every American has a chance to live up to his or her potential.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That will be my mission as president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think together we will make progress.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And, welcome back to this PBS Newshour debate, Democratic debate, here in Milwaukee.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's get right to the questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, to you first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Coming off the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, there are many voters who are taking a closer look at you, and your ideas, and they're asking how big a role do you foresee for the federal government?",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's already spending 21% of the entire U.S. economy.,0,0,1,0,1,1
How much larger would government be in the lives of Americans under a Sanders presidency?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, to put that in a context, Judy, I think we have to understand that in the last 30 years in this country there has been a massive transfer of wealth going from the hands of working families into the top one-tenth of 1% whose percentage of wealth has doubled.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"In other words, the very rich are getting richer, almost everybody is going — getting poorer.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"What I believe is the United States, in fact, should join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee healthcare to all people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Our Medicare for all single-payer proposal will save the average middle class family $5,000 a year.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I do believe that in the year 2016 we have to look in terms of public education as colleges as part of public education making public colleges and universities tuition free.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I believe that when real unemployment is close to 10%, and when our infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, Flint, Michigan comes to mind.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Our waste water plants, our rail, our airports, in many places are disintegrating.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Yeah, we can create 13 million jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure at a cost of a trillion dollars.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But, my question is how big would government be?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Would there be any limit on the size of the role of government...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... Of course there will be a limit, but when today you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality, when the middle class is disappearing, you have the highest rate of child poverty of almost any major country on Earth.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Yes, in my view, the government of a democratic society has a moral responsibility to play a vital role in making sure all of our people have a decent standard of living.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Judy, I think that the best analysis that I've seen based on Senator Sanders plans is that it would probably increase the size of the federal government by about 40%, but what is most concerning to me is that in looking at the plans — let's take healthcare for example.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Last week in a CNN town hall, the Senator told a questioner that the questioner would spend about $500 dollars in taxes to get about $5,000 dollars in healthcare.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Every progressive economist who has analyzed that says that the numbers don't add up, and that's a promise that cannot be kept, and it's really important now that we are getting into the rest of the country that both of us are held to account for explaining what we are proposing because, especially with healthcare, this is not about math.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"This is about people's lives, and we should level with the American people about what we can do to make sure they get quality affordable healthcare.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let us level with the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton has been going around the country saying Bernie Sanders wants to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, people are going to lose their MedicAid, they're going to lose their CHIP program.",0,0,1,1,1,1
I have fought my entire life to make sure that healthcare is a right for all people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're not going to dismantle everything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, here is the truth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Twenty-nine million people have no health insurance today in America.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"We pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.",1,0,1,0,1,1
One out of five Americans can't even afford the prescriptions their doctors are writing.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Millions of people have high deductibles and co-payments.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"What I said, and let me repeat it, I don't know what economists Secretary Clinton is talking to, but what I have said, and let me repeat it, that yes, the middle — the family right in the middle of the economy would pay $500 dollars more in taxes, and get a reduction in their healthcare costs of $5,000 dollars.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"In my view healthcare is a right of all people, not a privilege, and I will fight for that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
I can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And I took on the drug companies and I took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage.,0,0,0,0,1,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
And why I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment — namely the Affordable Care Act — is because I know how hard it was to get that done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are at 90 percent coverage.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We have to get the remaining 10.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down, especially prescription drug costs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think the American people deserve to know specifically how this would work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If it's Medicare for all, then you no longer have the Affordable Care Act, because the Affordable Care Act, as you know very well, is based on the insurance system, based on exchanges, based on a subsidy system.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"The Children's Health Insurance Program, which I helped to create, which covers 8 million kids, is also a different kind of program.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So if you're having Medicare for all, single-payer, you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And based on every analysis that I can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal, the numbers don't add up, and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Final thought, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is absolutely inaccurate.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Look, here is the reality, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There is one major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to all people.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"There is one major country — the United States — which ends up spending almost three times per capita what they do in the U.K. guaranteeing health care to all people, 50 percent more than they do in France guaranteeing health care to all people, far more than our Canadian neighbors, who guarantee health care to all people.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Please do not tell me that in this country, if — and here's the if — we have the courage to take on the drug companies, and have the courage to take on the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers, if we do that, yes, we can guarantee health care to all people in a much more cost effective way.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, let me just — let me just say, once again...",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"...that, having been in the trenches fighting for this, I believe strongly we have to guarantee health care.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe we are on the path to doing that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The last thing we need is to throw our country into a contentious debate about health care again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we are not England.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are not France.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We inherited a system that was set up during World War II; 170 million Americans get health insurance right now through their employers.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"So what we have tried to do and what President Obama succeeded in doing was to build on the health care system we have, get us to 90 percent coverage.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We have to get the other 10 percent of the way to 100.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I far prefer that and the chances we have to be successful there than trying to start all over again, gridlocking our system, and trying to get from zero to 100 percent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to move along.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to move along.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you might — you also have proposed fairly expansive ideas about government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You may remember this pledge from a State of the Union Address at which I believe you were present, in which these words were said: ""The era of big government is over.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
You may remember that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When asked your feelings about the federal government this week, 61 percent of New Hampshire Democrats told exit pollsters that they are angry or at least dissatisfied.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Given what you and Senator Sanders are proposing, an expanding government in almost every area of our lives, is it fair for Americans who fear government to fear you?",0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it is absolutely fair and necessary for Americans to vet both of our proposals, to ask the really hard questions about, what is it we think we can accomplish, why do we believe that, and what would be the results for the average American family?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In my case, whether it's health care, or getting us to debt-free tuition, or moving us toward paid family leave, I have been very specific about where I would raise the money, how much it would cost, and how I would move this agenda forward.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've tried to be as specific to answer questions so that my proposals can be vetted, because I feel like we have to level with people for the very reason, Gwen, that you are mentioning.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There is a great deal of skepticism about the federal government.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I'm aware of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It comes from the right, from the left, from people on all sides of the political spectrum.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we have a special obligation to make clear what we stand for, which is why I think we should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further, I think, alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I haven't heard either of you put a price tag on your — you say...,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ crosstalk ],0,0,0,0,0,0
I will put a price tag.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My price tag is about $100 billion a year.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And again, paid for.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And what I have said is I will not throw us further into debt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe I can get the money that I need by taxing the wealthy, by closing loopholes, the things that we are way overdue for doing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think once I'm in the White House we will have enough political capital to be able to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I am conscious of the fact that we have to also be very clear, especially with young people, about what kind of government is going to do what for them and what it will cost.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Secretary Clinton, you're not in the White House yet.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And let us be clear that every proposal that I have introduced has been paid for.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"For example, all right, who in America denies that we have an infrastructure that is crumbling?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, who denies that?",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Who denies that real unemployment today, including those who have given up looking for work and are working part-time is close to 10 percent?",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Who denies that African-American youth unemployment, real, is over 50 percent.",0,0,1,1,1,1
We need to create jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So yes, I will do away with the outrageous loopholes that allow profitable multinational corporations to stash billions of dollars in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda and in a given year pay zero, zero in federal income tax.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Yes, I'm going to do away with that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We will use those proceeds, a hundred billion a year, to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Yes, I believe that as a result of the illegal behavior on Wall Street, that they are a Wall Street that drove this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession — Great Depression.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Yes, I do believe that now after the American people bailed Wall Street out, yes, they should pay a Wall Street speculation tax so that we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We bailed them out.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Now it is their time to help the middle class.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I think, again, both of us share the goal of trying to make college affordable for all young Americans.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have set forth a compact that would do just that for debt-free tuition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We differ, however, on a couple of key points.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of them being that if you don't have some agreement within the system from states and from families and from students, it's hard to get to where we need to go.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And Senator Sanders's plan really rests on making sure that governors like Scott Walker contribute $23 billion on the first day to make college free.,0,0,0,0,1,1
I am a little skeptical about your governor actually caring enough about higher education to make any kind of commitment like that.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Next, we're going to...",0,0,0,0,0,0
A brief response.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Very brief, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Here is where we are with public education.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A 100, 150 years ago incredibly brave Americans said, you know what, working class kids, low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Like rich kids, they deserve to get a free education.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade.,0,0,0,0,1,0
The world has changed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is 2016.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In many ways, a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50, 60 years ago.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So, yes, I do believe that when we talk about public education in America, today, in a rapidly changing world, we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That should be a right of all Americans regardless of the income of their families.,0,0,0,0,0,1
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, your campaign — you and your campaign have made a clear appeal to women voters.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have talked repeatedly about the fact, we know you would be, if elected, the first woman president.",0,0,0,0,1,0
But in New Hampshire 55 percent of the women voters supported and voted for Senator Sanders.,0,0,0,0,1,1
What are women missing about you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first, Judy, I have spent my entire adult life working toward making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices, even if that choice is not to vote for me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that it's most important that we unleash the full potential of women and girls in our society.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I feel very strongly that I have an agenda, I have a record that really does respond to a lot of the specific needs that the women in our country face.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I'm going to keep making that case.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to keep making sure that everything I've done, everything that I stand for is going to be well known.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I have no argument with anyone making up her mind about who to support.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just hope that by the end of this campaign there will be a lot more supporting me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what I'm working towards.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"As you know, just quickly, as you know, your strong supporter, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said the other day that there's a special place in Hell for women who don't support other women.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Do you agree with what she said?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, look, I think that she's been saying that for as long as I've known her, which is about 25 years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it doesn't change my view that we need to empower everyone, women and men, to make the best decisions in their minds that they can make.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what I've always stood for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when it comes to the issues that are really on the front lines as to whether we're going to have equal pay, paid family leave, some opportunity for, you know, women to go as far as their hard work and talent take them, I think that we still have some barriers to knock down, which is why that's at the core of my campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I would note, just for a historic aside, somebody told me earlier today we've had like 200 presidential primary debates, and this is the first time there have been a majority of women on the stage.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So, you know, we'll take our progress wherever we can find it.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Look, we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women, from men, straight, gay, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans.",0,0,0,0,1,0
We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am very proud, if my memory is not correct — I think I am — that I have a lifetime — and I've been in Congress a few years — a lifetime 100 percent pro-choice voting record.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of Vermont from very significant majorities of women.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I'm very proud that I support legislation that is currently in the Congress, got support of almost all progressive Democrats in the House and Senate, which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And we will join the rest of the other — the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, do you worry at all that you will be the instrument of thwarting history, as Senator Clinton keeps claiming, that she might be the first woman president?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you know, I think, from a historical point of view, somebody with my background, somebody with my views, somebody who has spent his entire life taking on the big money interests, I think a Sanders victory would be of some historical accomplishment, as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"You know, I have said — I have said many times, you know, I'm not asking people to support me because I'm a woman.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And I appreciate greatly Senator Sanders' voting record.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I was very proud to get the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, because I've been a leader on these issues.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have gone time and time again to take on the vested interests who would keep women's health care decisions the province of the government instead of women ourselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm very proud that NARAL endorsed me because when it comes to it we need a leader on women's issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Somebody who, yes, votes right, but much more than that, leads the efforts to protect the hard-fought gains that women have made, that, make no mistake about it, are under tremendous attack, not just by the Republican presidential candidates but by a whole national effort to try to set back women's rights.",0,0,0,0,1,1

"Let me concur with the secretary, no question women's rights are under fierce attack all over this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will tell you something that really galls me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will not shock anybody to suggest that in politics there is occasionally a little bit of hypocrisy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just a little bit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All over this country we have Republican candidates for president saying we hate the government.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Government is the enemy.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We're going to cut Social Security to help you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to cut Medicare and Medicaid, federal aid to education to help you, because the government is so terrible.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But, by the way, when it comes to a woman having to make a very personal choice, ah, in that case, my Republican colleagues love the government and want the government to make that choice for every woman in America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what hypocrisy is.",0,0,0,1,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you both.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We turn now to the first of several questions from our partners at Facebook.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They were selected from a curated group of people we've been following of undecided voters.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The first comes from Claudia Looze, a 54-year-old woman who works as a program manager at a public affairs cable network in Madison, Wisconsin.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And she writes: ""Wisconsin is number one in African-American male incarceration, according to a University of Wisconsin study.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"They found that Wisconsin's incarceration rate for black men, which is at 13 percent, was nearly double the country's rate.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"What can we do across the nation to address this?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is one of the great tragedies in our country today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It has to be dealt with.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Today a male African-American baby born today stands a one-in-four chance of ending up in jail.,0,0,0,0,1,1
That is beyond unspeakable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
What we have to do is end over-policing in African-American neighborhoods.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The reality is that both the African-American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates.,0,0,0,0,1,1
The reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations.,0,1,0,0,1,1
The truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"We need fundamental police reform, clearly, clearly, when we talk about a criminal justice system.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people, often African-Americans, shot by police officers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will, in fact, be held accountable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I completely agree with Senator Sanders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The first speech I gave in this campaign back in April was about criminal justice reform and ending the era of mass incarceration.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"The statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling, because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African-Americans in our nation, twice the national average.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And we know of the tragic, terrible event that lead to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee, a young man unarmed, who should still be with us.",0,0,0,0,0,1
His family certainly believes that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so do I.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we have work to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There have been some good recommendations about what needs to happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
President Obama's policing commission came out with some.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I have fully endorsed those.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But we have to restore policing that will actually protect the communities that police officers are sworn to protect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, then we have to go after sentencing, and that's one of the problems here in Wisconsin because so much of what happened in the criminal justice system doesn't happen at the federal level, it happens at the state and local level.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"But, I would also add this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are other racial discrepancies.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Really systemic racism in this state, as in others, education, in employment, in the kinds of factors that too often lead from a position where young people, particularly young men, are pushed out of school early, are denied employment opportunities.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So, when we talk about criminal justice reform, and ending the era of mass incarceration, we also have to talk about jobs, education, housing, and other ways of helping communities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
Nothing that Secretary Clinton said do I disagree with.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"This mandatory sentencing, a very bad idea.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It takes away discretion from judges.,0,0,0,1,1,0
We have got to demilitarize local police departments so they do not look like occupying armies.,0,0,0,0,0,1
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
We have got to make sure that local police departments look like the communities they serve in their diversity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, where we are failing abysmally is in the very high rate of recidivism we see.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"People are being released from jail without the education, without the job training, without the resources that they need to get their lives together, then they end up — we're shocked that they end up back in jail again.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"So, we have a lot of work to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, here is a pledge I've made throughout this campaign, and it's really not a very radical pledge.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we have more people in jail, disproportionately African American and Latino, than China does, a communist authoritarian society four times our size.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Here's my promise, at the end of my first term as president we will not have more people in jail than any other country.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We will invest in education, and jobs for our kids, not incarceration and more jails.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, I was talking recently with a 23 year old black woman who voted for President Obama because she said she thought relations between the races would get better under his leadership, and his example.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Hardly anyone believes that they have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why do you think race relations would be better under a Clinton presidency?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What would you do that the nation's first African American has not been able to?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm just not sure I agree completely with that assessment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think under President Obama we have seen a lot of advances, the Affordable Care Act has helped more African Americans than any other group to get insurance, to be taken care of, but we also know a lot more than we did.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"We have a lot more social media, we have everybody with a cellphone.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, we are seeing the dark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our society.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I think President Obama has set a great example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think he has addressed a lot of these issues that have been quite difficult, but he has gone forward.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, what we have to do is to build on an honest conversation about where we go next.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We now have much more information about what must be done to fix our criminal justice system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We now have some good models about how better to provide employment, housing and education.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think what President Obama did was to exemplify the importance of this issue as our first African American president, and to address it both from the President's office, and through his advocacy, such as working with young men, and Mrs. Obama's work with young women.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, we can't rest.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have work to do, and we now know a lot more than we ever did before.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, it's going to be my responsibility to make sure we move forward to solve these problems that are now out in the open.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody can deny them.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"To use the Justice Department, as we just saw, they have said they are going to sue Ferguson, that entered into a consent agreement, and then tried to back out.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"So, we're going to enforce the law, we're going to change policing practices, we're going to change incarceration practices, but we're also going to emphasize education, jobs, and housing.",0,0,0,0,0,1

Senator Sanders?,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think, Judy, what has to be appreciated is that, as a result of the disastrous and illegal behavior on Wall Street, millions of lives were hurt.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"People lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings.",0,0,1,0,1,0
Turns out that the African-American community and the Latino community were hit especially hard.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"As I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse.",1,0,1,1,1,1
"So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration — which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother — clearly, we are looking at institutional racism.",0,0,1,1,1,1
We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.",0,0,0,1,1,1
So race relation was be better under a Sanders presidency than they've been?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Absolutely, because what we will do is say, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think when you give low-income kids — African-American, white, Latino kids — the opportunities to get their lives together, they are not going to end up in jail.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They're going to end up in the productive economy, which is where we want them.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me turn this on its head, because when we talk about race in this country, we always talk about African-Americans, people of color.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I want to talk about white people, OK?",0,0,0,0,0,0
White people?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ laughter ],0,0,0,0,0,0
So many people will be surprised to find out that we are sitting in one of the most racially polarized metropolitan areas in the country.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"By the middle of this century, the nation is going to be majority nonwhite.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Our public schools are already there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If working-class, white Americans are about to be outnumbered, are already underemployed in many cases, and one study found they are dying sooner, don't they have a reason to be resentful, Senator — Secretary Clinton?",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Look, I am deeply concerned about what's happening in every community in America, and that includes white communities, where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism, addiction, earlier deaths.",0,0,0,1,1,1
People with a high school education or less are not even living as long as their parents lived.,0,0,0,0,1,1
This is a remarkable and horrifying fact.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And that's why I've come forward with, for example, a plan to revitalize coal country, the coalfield communities that have been so hard hit by the changing economy, by the reduction in the use of coal.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, coal miners and their families who helped turn on the lights and power our factories for generations are now wondering, has our country forgotten us?",0,0,0,0,0,1
Do people not care about all of our sacrifice?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'm going to do everything I can to address distressed communities, whether they are communities of color, whether they are white communities, whether they are in any part of our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I particularly appreciate the proposal that Congressman Jim Clyburn has — the 10-20-30 proposal — to try to spend more federal dollars in communities with persistent generational poverty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you look at the numbers, there are actually as many, if not more white communities that are truly being left behind and left out.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"So, yes, I do think it would be a terrible oversight not to try to address the very real problems that white Americans — particularly those without a lot of education whose jobs have — you know, no longer provided them or even no longer present in their communities, because we have to focus where the real hurt is.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And that's why, as president, I will look at communities that need special help and try to deliver that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator — Senator, I want you to respond to that, but I also want you to — am I wrong?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Is it even right to be describing this as a matter of race?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, you can, because African-Americans and Latinos not only face the general economic crises of low wages, and high unemployment, and poor educational opportunities, but they face other problems, as well.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So, yes, we can talk about it as a racial issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it is a general economic issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And here's what the economic issue is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The wages that high school graduates receive today are significantly less, whether you are white or black, than they used to be.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Why is that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because of a series of disastrous trade policies which have allowed corporate America through NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, Secretary Clinton and I disagree on those issues.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"But view is those trade policies have enabled corporate America to shut down in this country, throw millions of people out on the street.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Now no one thinks that working in the factory is the greatest job in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But you know what, you can make a middle class wage, you have decent health care, decent benefits.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You once had a pension.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Those jobs, in many cases, are now gone.",0,0,1,0,1,1
They're off to China.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now you are a worker, white worker, black worker, who had a decent job, that manufacturing job is gone.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What have you got now?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You are working at McDonald's?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is why there is massive despair all over this country.,0,0,0,1,0,0
People have worked their entire lives.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They're making a half, two-thirds what they used to make.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Their kids are having a hard time finding any work at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's why this study, which shows that if you can believe it today, for white working class people between 45 and 54, life expectancy is actually going down.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Suicide, alcoholism, drugs, that's why we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country, and not just a handful of billionaires who have enormous economic and political power.",0,0,0,1,0,1

Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, one of the causes of anxiety for working class Americans is connected to immigrants.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"President Obama, as you know, has issued executive actions to permit some 5 million undocumented immigrants who are living now in the United States to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation to get work permits.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Would you go further than that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if so, how specifically would you do it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Should an undocumented family watching this debate tonight, say, in Nevada, rest easy, not fear of further deportations under a Sanders presidency?",0,0,0,0,0,0
The answer is yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got 11 million undocumented people in this country.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"I have talked to some of the young kids with tears rolling down their cheeks, are scared to death that today they may or their parents may be deported.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe that we have got to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something that I strongly supported.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that we have got to move toward a path toward citizenship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I agree with President Obama who used executive orders to protect families because the Congress, the House was unable or refused to act.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And in fact I would go further.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What would motivate me and what would be the guiding light for me in terms of immigration reform, Judy, is to bring families together, not divide them up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And let me say this also.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Somebody who is very fond of the president, agrees with him most of the time, I disagree with his recent deportation policies.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And I would not support those.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Bottom line is a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people, if Congress doesn't do the right thing, we use the executive orders of the president.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
I strongly support the president's executive actions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope the Supreme Court upholds them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think there is constitutional and legal authority for the president to have done what he did.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I am against the raids.,0,1,1,0,1,0
"I'm against the kind of inhumane treatment that is now being visited upon families, waking them up in the middle of the night, rounding them up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We should be deporting criminals, not hardworking immigrant families who do the very best they can and often are keeping economies going in many places in our country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I'm a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Have been ever since I was in the Senate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was one of the original sponsors of the DREAM Act.,0,0,0,0,1,1
I voted for comprehensive immigration reform in 2007.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Senator Sanders voted against it at that time.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Because I think we have to get to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as president I would expand enormous energy, literally call every member of Congress that I thought I could persuade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hopefully after the 2016 election, some of the Republicans will come to their senses and realize we are not going to deport 11 or 12 million people in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And they will work with me to get comprehensive immigration reform.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, I do have a disagreement here.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"If my memory is correct, I think when we saw children coming from these horrendous, horrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries, people who are fleeing drug violence and cartel violence, I thought it was a good idea to allow those children to stay in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"That was not, as I understand it, the secretary's position.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"In terms of 2007 immigration reform, yeah, I did vote against it.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"I voted against it because the Southern Poverty Law Center, among other groups, said that the guest-worker programs that were embedded in this agreement were akin to slavery.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Akin to slavery, where people came into this country to do guest work were abused, were exploited, and if they stood up for their rights, they'd be thrown out of this country.",0,0,1,1,0,1
So it wasn't just me who opposed it.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"It was LULAC, one of the large Latino organizations in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It was the AFL-CIO.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was some of the most progressive members of the United States Congress who opposed it for that reason.,0,0,1,1,1,1
But we are where we are right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And where we are right now is we have got to stand up to the Trumps of the world who are trying to divide us up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What we have to do right now is bring our people together and understand that we must provide a path towards citizenship for 11 million undocumented people.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Two quick responses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One, with respect to the Central American children, I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately, but we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I've also called for the end of family detention, for the end of privately-run detention centers, along with private prisons, which I think are really against the common good and the rule of law.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"And with respect to the 2007 bill, this was Ted Kennedy's bill.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And I think Ted Kennedy had a very clear idea about what needed to be done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I was proud to stand with him and support it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me just respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I worked with Ted Kennedy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He was the chairman of my committee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I loved Ted Kennedy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But on this issue, when you have one of the large Latino organizations in America saying vote no, and you have the AFL-CIO saying vote no, and you have leading progressive Democrats, in fact, voting no, I don't apologize for that vote.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"But in terms of the children, I don't know to whom you're sending a message.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Who are you sending a message to?,0,0,0,0,0,0
These are children who are leaving countries and neighborhoods where their lives are at stake.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was the fact.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I don't think we use them to send a message.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we welcome them into this country and do the best we can to help them get their lives together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that just wasn't — that just wasn't the fact, Senator.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"The fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message, because we knew that so many of these children were being abused, being treated terribly while they tried to get to our border.",0,0,0,0,1,1
So we have a disagreement on this.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I think now what I've called for is counsel for every child so that no child has to face any kind of process without someone who speaks and advocates for that child so that the right decision hopefully can be made.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you would allow me now to move on, we've been talking about children.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to talk about seniors.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"OK. You know, you judge a nation not by the number of millionaires and billionaires it has, but by how you treat, we treat, the most vulnerable and fragile people in our nation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And by those standards, we're not doing particularly well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have the highest rate of childhood poverty among almost any major country on Earth.,0,1,1,0,1,1
"And in terms of seniors, there are millions of seniors — and I've talked to them in my state of Vermont and all over this country — who are trying to get by on $11,000, $12,000, $13,000 a year Social Security.",0,0,0,0,1,1

"And when we — and when we do that, we don't do what the Republicans want, which is to cut Social Security.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We do what the American people want, to expand Social Security by $1,300 a year for people under $16,000, and we extend the life of Social Security for 58 years.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Yes, the wealthiest people, the top 1.5 percent, will pay more in taxes.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"But a great nation like ours should not be in a position where elderly people are cutting their pills in half, where they don't have decent nutrition, where they can't heat their homes in the wintertime.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That is not what America should be about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If elected president, I will do everything I can to expand Social Security benefits, not just for seniors, but for disabled veterans, as well.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
I think — I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We could overthrow Assad tomorrow if we wanted to.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And in fact, Kissinger's actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world.",0,1,1,1,1,1
So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy, and we have yet to know who that is.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, it ain't Henry Kissinger.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's for sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's fine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's fine.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"You know, I listen to a wide variety of voices that have expertise in various areas.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it is fair to say, whatever the complaints that you want to make about him are, that with respect to China, one of the most challenging relationships we have, his opening up China and his ongoing relationships with the leaders of China is an incredibly useful relationship for the United States of America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"So if we want to pick and choose — and I certainly do — people I listen to, people I don't listen to, people I listen to for certain areas, then I think we have to be fair and look at the entire world, because it's a big, complicated world out there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, yes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"I find — I mean, it's just a very different, you know, historical perspective here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Kissinger was one of those people during the Vietnam era who talked about the domino theory.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Not everybody remembers that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The domino theory, you know, if Vietnam goes, China, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's what he talked about, the great threat of China.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then, after the war, this is the guy who, in fact, yes, you're right, he opened up relations with China, and now pushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he's urging companies to shut down and move to China.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Not my kind of guy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, let me — let me move on to another country with which the U.S. has a complicated relationship, Senator Sanders, and that's Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the one hand, we're aware that Russia is a country that the United States needs to cooperate with.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Just tonight, Secretary of State John Kerry has announced what appears to be an agreement with the Russians to lead — that could lead toward a ceasefire in Syria, would be the first cessation of conflict in that country, in that civil war in five years, but it comes at a very high price, because not only have all — have we seen the deaths, the removal of so many people, millions of people, we now see the Russians in the last few weeks have bombed in a way that benefits President Assad, has not gone after ISIS.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"So my question to you is, when it comes to dealing with Russia, are you prepared — how hard are you prepared to be?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you prepared to institute further economic sanctions?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Would you be prepared to move militarily if Russia moves on Eastern Europe?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It seems to me that Russia recently has gotten the better of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, this is what I would say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is a complicated relationship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I congratulate Secretary of State John Kerry and the president for working on this agreement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As you've indicated, what is happening in Syria, the number of people, the hundreds of thousands of people who have been killed — men, women, 20,000 children, the people who are forced to flee their own country — their own country — it is unspeakable.",0,0,1,1,1,1
It is a real horror.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, what I think is that right now we have got to do our best in developing positive relations with Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But let's be clear: Russia's aggressive actions in the Crimea and in Ukraine have brought about a situation where President Obama and NATO — correctly, I believe — are saying, you know what, we're going to have to beef up our troop level in that part of the world to tell Putin that his aggressiveness is not going to go unmatched, that he is not going to get away with aggressive action.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I happen to believe that Putin is doing what he is doing because his economy is increasingly in shambles and he's trying to rally his people in support of him.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But bottom line is: The president is right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to put more money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to work with NATO to protect Eastern Europe against any kind of Russian aggression.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, with respect to Syria, I really do appreciate the efforts that Secretary Kerry has made.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The agreement on humanitarian relief now needs to be implemented, because there are enclaves that are literally filled with starving people throughout Syria.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"The agreement on a cease-fire, though, is something that has to be implemented more quickly than the schedule that the Russians agreed to.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, the Russians wanted to buy time.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Are they buying time to continue their bombardment on behalf of the Assad regime to further decimate what's left of the opposition, which would be a grave disservice to any kind of eventual cease-fire?",0,0,0,1,0,0
So I know Secretary Kerry is working extremely hard to try to move that cease-fire up as quickly as possible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I would add this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, the Security Council finally got around to adopting a resolution.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"At the core of that resolution is an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva, which set forth a cease-fire and moving toward a political resolution, trying to bring the parties at stake in Syria together.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"This is incredibly complicated, because we've got Iran as a big player, in addition to Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We have Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and others who have very important interests in their view.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is one of the areas I've disagreed with Senator Sanders on, who has called for Iranian troops trying to end civil war in Syria, which I think would be a grave mistake.",0,0,0,1,1,0
Putting Iranian troops right on the border of the Golan right next to Israel would be a nonstarter for me.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia to work together, as he has suggested in the past, is equally a nonstarter.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"So let's support what Secretary Kerry and the president are doing, but let's hope that we can accelerate the cease-fire, because I fear that the Russians will continue their bombing, try to do everything they can to destroy what's left of the opposition.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And remember, the Russians have not gone after ISIS or any of the other terrorist groups.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"So as we get a cease-fire and maybe some humanitarian corridors, that still leaves the terrorist groups on the doorstep of others in Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and the like.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So we've got some real work to do, and let's try to make sure we actually implement what has been agreed to with the Russians.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just — just say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For a start, the secretary and I disagree — and I think the president does not agree with her — in terms of the concept of a no-fly zone in Syria.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"I think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there, as I mentioned a moment ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I applaud Secretary Kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's hope that it holds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But furthermore, what we have got to do, I'm sorry, yes, I do believe that we have got to do everything that we can, and it will not happen tomorrow.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I do hope that in years to come, just as occurred with Cuba, 10, 20 years ago, people would say, reach normalized relations with Cuba.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, I hope we can end the trade embargo with Cuba as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with Iran, maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world, yes, that is something I want to achieve.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive, to be principled, but to have the goal of trying to improve relations.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's how you make peace in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You sit down and you work with people, you make demands of people, in this case demanding Iran stop the support of international terrorism.",0,0,0,1,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I respectfully disagree.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we have achieved a great deal with the Iranian nuclear agreement to put a lid on the Iranian nuclear weapons program.,0,0,0,0,1,1
That has to be enforced absolutely with consequences for Iran at the slightest deviation from their requirements under the agreement.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I do not think we should promise or even look toward normalizing relations because we have a lot of other business to get done with Iran.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, they have to stop being the main state sponsor of terrorism.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Yes, they have to stop trying to destabilize the Middle East, causing even more chaos.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Yes, they've got to get out of Syria.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They've got to quit sponsoring Hezbollah and Hamas.,0,0,1,1,0,0
They have got to quit trying to ship rockets into Gaza that can be used against Israel.,0,0,1,1,0,1
We have a lot of work to do with Iran before we ever say that they could move toward normalized relations with us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a lot of work to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a lot of work to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I recall when Secretary Clinton ran against then-Senator Obama, she was critical of him for suggesting that maybe you want to talk to Iran, that you want to talk to our enemies.",0,0,0,1,1,0
I have no illusion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course you are right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Iran is sponsoring terrorism in many parts of the world, destabilizing areas.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Everybody knows that.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I said no.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"And in fact, in Obama administration, we did not meet with anybody without conditions.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"No, I think the idea was that president — then-Senator Obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents.",0,0,0,1,0,0
It's easier to talk to your friends.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's harder to talk to your enemies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we should do both.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me move on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have both mentioned the humanitarian tragedies which have been an outgrowth in part of what has happened in Syria and in Libya.,0,0,0,0,0,1
More than a million refugees entered Europe in 2015.,0,1,1,0,1,1
"Another 76,000 just last month, that is about 2,000 arrivals every day.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Nearly 400 people have been lost at sea so far this year, crossing the Mediterranean.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And there are reports that 10,000 children are missing.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"If we are leaders in this world, where should the U.S. be on this?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What should the United States be doing, Secretary Clinton?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I was pleased that NATO announced just this week that they're going to start doing patrols in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean, to try to interdict the smugglers, to try to prevent the kind of tragedies that we have seen all too often, also to try to prevent more refugees from coming to the European Union.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And it's especially significant that they are working with both Turkey and Greece in order to do this.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"With respect to the United States, I think our role in NATO, our support for the E.U., as well as our willingness to take refugees so long as they are thoroughly vetted and that we have confidence from intelligence and other sources that they can come to our country, we should be doing our part.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we should back up the recent donors conference to make sure we have made our contribution to try to deal with the enormous cost that these refugees are posing to Turkey and to members of the E.U.,0,0,0,0,0,1
in particular.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a humanitarian catastrophe.,0,0,0,1,0,0
There is no other description of it.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"So we do as the United States have to support our friends, our allies in Europe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to stand with them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to provide financial support to them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to provide the NATO support to back up the mission that is going on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have to take properly vetted refugees ourselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to go on a congressional delegation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I went to one of these Turkish refugee camps right on the border of Syria.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And what a sad sight that was: Men, women, children forced out of their homes.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And Turkey, by the way, did a very decent thing, providing what was reasonable housing and conditions for those people.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"It seems to me that given our history as a nation that has been a beacon of hope for the oppressed, for the downtrodden, that I very strongly disagree with those Republican candidates who say, you know what, we've got to turn our backs on women and children who left their home with nothing, nothing at all.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That is not what America is supposed to be about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I believe that working with Europe — and, by the way, you know, we've got some very wealthy countries there in that part of the world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You got Kuwait and you got Qatar and you got Saudi Arabia.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They have a responsibility, as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think this is a worldwide — that the entire world needs to come together to deal with this horrific refugee crisis we're seeing from Syria and Afghanistan, as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And we have a final question from our Facebook family.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it goes to Senator Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It comes from Robert Andrews.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"He's a 40-year-old stay-at-home dad in Dover, Massachusetts.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"He says, ""The world has seen many great leaders in the course of human history.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Can you name two leaders — one American and one foreign — who would influence your foreign policy decisions?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And why do you see them as — why are they influential?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the American people were unemployed, country was in incredible despair.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And he stood before the American people and he said, ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,"" a profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible depression.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And then what he did is redefine the role of government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, you had Herbert Hoover before that saying, no, we got to only worry about the deficit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So what if mass unemployment exists?,0,0,0,0,0,0
So what if children are going hungry?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not the role of the government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when FDR said, ""Yeah, it is,"" that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs, to build homes, to feed people, to protect the farmers, we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And kind of — that's what I see our campaign is about right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In this particular moment of serious crises, saying to the American people don't give up on the political process.",0,0,0,0,0,0
don't listen to the Trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"If we reengage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people, we can make public colleges and universities tuition-free.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In the same light, as the foreign leader, Winston Churchill's politics were not my politics.",0,0,0,1,0,0
He was kind of a conservative guy in many respects.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But nobody can deny that as a wartime leader, he rallied the British people when they stood virtually alone against the Nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Those are two leaders that I admire very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
I certainly agree with FDR for all the reasons Senator Sanders said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I agree about the role that he played both in war and in peace on the economy and defeating fascism around the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would choose Nelson Mandela for his generosity of heart, his understanding of the need for reconciliation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to — I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership, because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test.",0,0,0,1,1,0
And this is not the first time that he has criticized President Obama.,0,0,0,0,1,0
In the past he has called him weak.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He has called him a disappointment.,1,0,1,0,0,0
He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyers' remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And I just couldn't agree — disagree more with those kinds of comments.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, from my perspective, maybe because I understand what President Obama inherited, not only the worst financial crisis but the antipathy of the Republicans in Congress, I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for being a president...[",0,0,1,1,0,0

And it is a — the kind of criticism that we've heard from Senator Sanders about our president I expect from Republicans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We had a $1.4 trillion deficit.,0,1,1,1,1,1
And the world's financial system is on the verge of collapse.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"As a result of his efforts and the efforts of Joe Biden against unprecedented, I was there in the Senate, unprecedented Republican obstructionism, we have made enormous progress.",0,0,0,0,1,0

Last I heard we lived in a democratic society.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Last I heard, a United States senator had the right to disagree with the president, including a president who has done such an extraordinary job.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So I have voiced criticisms.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Maybe you haven't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think to suggest that I have voiced criticism, this blurb that you talk about, you know what the blurb said?",0,0,0,1,0,0
The blurb said that the next president of the United States has got to be aggressive in bringing people into the political process.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what I said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is what I believe.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have worked for his re-election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
His first election and his re-election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do senators have the right to disagree with the president?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Have you ever disagreed with a president?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I suspect you may have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Senator, what I am concerned about, is not disagreement on issues, saying that this is what I would rather do, I don't agree with the president on that, calling the president weak, calling him a disappointment, calling several times that he should have a primary opponent when he ran for re-election in 2012, you know, I think that goes further than saying we have our disagreements.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"As a senator, yes, I was a senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I understand we can disagree on the path forward.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"There is no president, in my view, not Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, who has the capability or the power to take on Wall Street, large campaign donors, the corporate media, the big money interests in this country alone.",0,0,0,1,0,0
This campaign is not just about electing a president.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I am not a single-issue candidate, and I do not believe we live in a single-issue country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back, whether it's poison in the water of the children of Flint, or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country, or whether it is any other American today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, by sexism, by discrimination against the LGBT community, against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers, that's what I want to take on.",0,0,0,0,0,1

It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the reason that's important and the reason it's important to me is because we need, I'm a Democrat so if you're a Republican, you're going to disagree but we need to take the senate back because we need to confirm the Supreme Court justice because that fifth vote on the Supreme Court can overturn Citizens United and get this obscene, ridiculous amount of money out so I never have to do a fundraiser again.",0,0,0,1,0,1

"Again to have these conversations, I hope he stays in for the entire election and if he were to win the nomination, I will do whatever I can including if asked a fundraiser like this again to try to give him or her, Hillary, I hope she wins a Senate because honestly we see what happens when a President tries to get their Supreme Court justice confirmed without the Senate.",0,0,0,0,0,0

We are not a country that is afraid and I refuse to accept that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why do you think fear has been working at least in the Republican party?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because fear's always worked one way or another.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Kathleen?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, going back to the financing of political campaigns, everybody loves to talk about how much we dislike Citizens United, you'll find people on both sides, Republicans dislike it too, at least a lot of them do.",0,0,0,1,0,1

Is that ever anything that gets serious consideration and would it be possible?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I mean, certainly, Democrats have supported public financing of campaigns, I know I do, and many of my colleagues do.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And we do need to, you know, have an effort that both sides come together, and try to make that reform.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But Republicans have no interest in changing the campaign finance system.,0,0,0,1,0,1
They support the hundreds of millions of dollars of outside undue influence swooping in and weighing heavily on the outcome of any election contest.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It's obscene and we need to elect majorities in Congress so Democrats can make a difference in changing it.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Hugh, last question.",0,0,0,0,0,0

That is a question that I'm not even going near.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think that's going to happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Thank you, Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's what I want to talk about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump is different.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have seen him insult women.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.",1,0,1,0,1,1
So this is who Donald Trump is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we want to get to some questions from online...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Am I allowed to respond to that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I assume I am.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, you can respond to that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's just words, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's just words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.",1,0,0,1,1,1
"I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to help the African-Americans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I am going to help the inner cities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.,0,0,0,0,1,1
She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump -- I want to get to audience questions and online questions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?",0,0,0,1,0,0
You're going to have -- you're going to get to respond right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sounds fair.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This tape is generating intense interest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In just 48 hours, it's become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, ""Trump says the campaign has changed him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When did that happen?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you have two minutes for this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was locker room talk, as I told you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That was locker room talk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not proud of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And certainly, I'm not proud of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that was something that happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Mine are words, and his was action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
His was what he's done to women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.",0,1,1,1,0,0
Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.,0,0,1,1,1,0
Four of them here tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.",1,1,0,0,1,0
"Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So don't tell me about words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it is things that people say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.",0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Can we please hold the applause?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican.""",0,0,1,0,1,1
He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.,0,0,1,1,1,0
And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.",1,1,1,0,0,1
So you really owe him an apology.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Number two, Michelle Obama.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, you talk about friend?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.",0,0,1,1,1,0
And I'll tell you what.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?",0,0,0,1,0,0
People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.,0,0,1,1,1,1
And it's a disgrace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to let you talk about e-mails.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"Oh, really?",0,0,0,0,0,0
In the first debate...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And really, the audience needs to calm down here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Because you'd be in jail.,0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please do not applaud.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're just wasting time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You've said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, ""extremely careless.""",0,0,0,1,1,0
"The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails.",0,0,1,1,1,1
You don't call that extremely careless?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not making any excuses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was a mistake.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And I am very sorry about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all -- anyone who says otherwise has no basis -- that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.",0,1,1,1,1,1
I take classified materials very seriously and always have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden.",0,0,0,0,1,0
So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"OK, we're going to move on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.,0,0,1,1,0,1
Right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, it's amazing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm watching Hillary go over facts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That wasn't before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was after.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She got it from the United States Congress.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.",0,0,0,1,0,0
What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We have to move on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You did that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait a minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One second.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We want to give the audience a chance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Secretary Clinton, you can respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Then we have to move on to an audience question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, it's just not true.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And so please, go to...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, you didn't delete them?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Allow her to respond, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was personal e-mails, not official.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Oh, 33,000?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so...",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Oh, yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What about the other 15,000?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Please allow her to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She didn't talk while you talked.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, that's true, I didn't.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because you have nothing to say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Get off this question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK, Donald.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's at least focus...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's see what happens...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Allow her to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
on some of the issues that people care about tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's get to their questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has a question about health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ken?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why aren't you bringing...,0,0,0,0,0,0
We brought up the e-mails.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, it hasn't.",0,0,1,0,1,0
It hasn't.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And it hasn't been finished at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ken Karpowicz has a question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's nice to -- one on three.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Premiums have gone up.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Deductibles have gone up.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Copays have gone up.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Prescriptions have gone up.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And the coverage has gone down.,0,0,0,0,1,0
What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If he wants to start, he can start.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, go ahead, Donald.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Premiums have gotten too high.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.",0,0,1,0,1,1
But that in and of itself was a good thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.",0,1,0,0,1,1
So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we've got to get costs down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And then we would have to start all over again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.",1,0,1,0,1,1
That's the highest we've ever been in our country.,1,0,1,0,1,0
"Secretary Clinton, your time is up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Obamacare is a disaster.,0,0,0,1,0,0
You know it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We all know it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.,0,0,1,0,1,0
It's only getting worse.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In '17, it implodes by itself.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.",0,0,0,1,1,0
We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Obamacare will never work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's very bad, very bad health insurance.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Far too expensive.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.",0,0,1,1,1,1

"I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.",0,0,0,1,0,0

That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.,0,0,0,1,1,1

Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's called extreme vetting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.,1,0,1,1,1,1
"People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.",1,0,1,0,1,0

We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We know you want tougher vetting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not a perfect system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And we need to do our part.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.",0,0,0,0,1,0
How do you do that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.,0,0,0,0,0,1
How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?,0,0,0,0,0,0

Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.",0,0,0,1,1,0
But -- and I say that about a lot of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I wish you would have done this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She never changed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And she never will change.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She never will change.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.,0,0,0,0,1,1
But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We're cutting taxes for the middle class.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.",0,1,0,1,1,0
You can look at me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's raising your taxes really high.,0,1,1,0,1,0
And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes.,0,1,1,0,1,0
That in itself is a big difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to be thriving again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have no growth in this country.,0,0,1,0,1,1
There's no growth.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.",0,0,1,1,1,1
We're down at 1 percent.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"And that's, like, no growth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're going lower, in my opinion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.,0,1,1,0,1,0
"Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But I'll tell you what he's going to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Now, here's what I want to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.",0,0,0,1,1,0
I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's called the Buffett rule.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.",0,0,0,1,1,1
I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to invest in hard-working families.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.",0,1,1,0,1,1
And we need to reverse that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to give you -- Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I just wanted to tell our viewers what she's referring to.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign.",0,0,0,0,1,1
The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"You've said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"You have not answered, though, a simple question.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?,0,0,0,1,0,0
Of course I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.",0,0,0,0,1,0
I know many of her donors.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Her donors took massive tax write-offs.,0,0,1,1,1,1
So have you (inaudible) personal federal income tax?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.",0,0,1,1,1,1
I absolutely used it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So we won't make them famous.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So can you -- can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I love depreciation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, she's given it to us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I say it all the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She talks about health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't she do something about it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
She talks about taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't she do something about it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With her, it's all talk and no action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In the past...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.",0,0,0,1,0,0
She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Congratulations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Great job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary -- I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, here we go again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.",0,0,0,0,1,0
But that's not the point here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't you do it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't you do it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Allow her to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because I was a senator with a Republican president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, really?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will be the president and we will get it done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's exactly right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you were not an effective senator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please allow her to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She didn't interrupt you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Look, he has now said repeatedly, ""30 years this and 30 years that.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm very glad to do so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.",1,0,0,0,1,1
Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.,0,0,0,0,1,1
I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to move on to Syria.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Both of you have mentioned that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She said a lot of things that were false.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, we can -- no, Mr. Trump, we're going to go on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is about the audience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because she has been a disaster as a senator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A disaster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, we're going to move on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world's attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.",0,0,1,1,1,1
So this next question comes through social media through Facebook.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Isn't it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.,0,0,1,1,1,1
They're interested in keeping Assad in power.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've stood up to Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I did as secretary of state.,0,0,0,0,1,0
That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.,0,1,0,0,1,1
It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.,0,0,1,1,1,1
So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...",1,0,1,0,0,0
"No, I wasn't.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I was gone.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you were in contact -- excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You were...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Obama draws the line in the sand.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It was laughed at all over the world what happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Not good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Russia is new in terms of nuclear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are old.,1,0,0,0,0,0
We're tired.,1,0,0,0,0,0
We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.,1,0,0,0,0,0
A very bad thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad.",0,0,0,1,1,0
She talks in favor of the rebels.,0,0,0,0,1,0
She doesn't even know who the rebels are.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.",0,0,0,0,1,0
And you know what happens?,0,0,0,0,0,0
They end up being worse than the people.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Gadhafi's out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a mess.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.",1,1,1,1,1,1
I'm sure you probably have heard that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was a disaster.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We sign a peace treaty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Everyone's all excited.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.",1,0,1,1,1,1
But look at that deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Iran now and Russia are now against us.,0,0,0,1,1,0
So she wants to fight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She wants to fight for rebels.,0,0,0,0,1,0
There's only one problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't even know who the rebels are.,0,0,0,1,0,0
So what's the purpose?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And one thing I have to say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Your two minutes is up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.",0,0,0,1,1,0
Russia is killing ISIS.,0,0,1,1,1,0
And Iran is killing ISIS.,0,0,1,1,1,0
And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
If you were president...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I want to remind you what your running mate said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.",0,0,0,1,1,1
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I disagree.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You disagree with your running mate?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you have to knock out ISIS.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.",0,0,0,1,1,1
We have people that want to fight both at the same time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But Syria is no longer Syria.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I believe we have to get ISIS.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.,0,0,0,1,0,0
She had a chance to do something with Syria.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They had a chance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that was the line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And she didn't.,0,0,0,0,1,0
What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.",0,0,0,1,0,0
What do you think will happen if it falls?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that it basically has fallen.,0,0,1,0,0,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It basically has fallen.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Let me tell you something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You take a look at Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.",0,0,0,1,1,0
Why can't they do it quietly?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?",0,0,0,1,0,0
People leave.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?",0,0,0,1,0,0
How stupid is our country?,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are sometimes reasons the military does that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Psychological warfare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can't think of any.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can't think of any.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm pretty good at it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It might be to help get civilians out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have General Flynn.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.",0,0,1,0,1,1
I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We talk about it all the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?",0,0,0,1,0,0
How -- why would these people stay there?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've been reading now...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Tell me what your strategy is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They're gone.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.",0,0,0,0,1,1
All I say is this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I'm going to go to Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo.",0,0,0,1,1,0
You talk about diplomatic efforts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Those have failed.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Cease-fires have failed.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?,0,0,0,1,0,0
I would not use American ground forces in Syria.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I think that would be a very serious mistake.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I don't think that is a smart strategy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...",0,0,0,0,1,0
But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Everything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"No, he doesn't.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would go after Baghdadi.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So I think that could help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would also consider arming the Kurds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to move on...,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what's funny?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You had many answers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's really -- it's really very interesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got a question over here from James Carter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Carter?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?",0,0,0,0,0,0
That question begins for Mr. Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.",0,0,1,1,1,0
I will be a president for all of our people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.",0,1,1,0,1,1
Not in this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It stripped us of manufacturing jobs.,0,1,1,0,1,0
We lost our jobs.,0,0,1,0,1,0
We lost our money.,0,0,1,1,1,0
We lost our plants.,0,0,1,0,1,0
It is a disaster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.",1,0,1,0,1,0
She called it the gold standard.,1,1,1,0,1,0
"And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.",0,1,1,1,1,0
They actually said that she lied.,0,0,0,0,1,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And she lied.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But she's lied about a lot of things.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's been talking about it for years.,0,0,0,0,0,0

She doesn't get it done.,0,0,0,0,0,0

The same exact thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They talk, they don't get it done.",0,0,0,1,0,0
You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.,0,0,0,0,1,1
African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.,0,0,1,0,1,1
The education is a disaster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jobs are essentially nonexistent.,0,0,0,0,0,1

It can't get any worse.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Nothing's going to ever happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's just going to be talk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She's not doing any me favors.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you, she's all talk.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It doesn't get done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look at upstate New York.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Your two minutes is up.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I want to give you a minute to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a divided nation.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We have a very divided nation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You look at Charlotte.,0,0,0,0,0,0

She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You said, if a leader doesn't have it, quote, ""he or she won't be one for very long.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape.",0,1,0,1,0,0
Is that the discipline of a good leader?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, there wasn't check out a sex tape.",1,0,1,1,1,0
It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You mentioned sex tape.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Guess what?,0,0,0,0,0,0

Guess what happened?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.,0,1,1,0,1,1

It's a very effective way of communication.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?",0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm shocked to hear that.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, it's not only my opinion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Everybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
African-American incomes went up 33 percent.,0,0,1,0,1,1

He stuck with me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have worked and I admire President Obama.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.,0,0,1,0,1,1
That was a terrible time for our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to move along.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nine million people lost their jobs.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Secretary Clinton, we have to...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Five million homes were lost.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Secretary Clinton, we're moving.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.,0,0,0,1,1,1
We are back on the right track.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're almost out of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have another...,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have the slowest growth since 1929.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We're moving to an audience question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much both of you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
We have another audience question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Good evening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you're right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is one of the most important issues in this election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Donald doesn't agree with that.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.,0,0,0,1,1,0
I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.",0,0,1,1,1,1
I think that was a dereliction of duty.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're out of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have a vacancy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that this is so important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So important to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.",0,0,0,1,1,0
What I ask is this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Pretty much self-funding money.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office.",0,0,1,1,1,1
She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?",0,0,1,1,0,0
"It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Why aren't you putting some money in?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have a lot of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.",0,0,0,0,1,0
So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm just curious.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to get on to one more question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The question was about the Supreme Court.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have -- we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ken?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Mr. Trump, two minutes?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Under absolutely siege.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.,0,0,0,1,1,1
We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we need much more than wind and solar.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you look at our miners.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.,0,1,1,1,1,0
There is a thing called clean coal.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.",0,0,1,0,0,1
So good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.,0,0,0,0,1,1
I will bring our energy companies back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They'll be able to compete.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They'll make money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They'll pay off our national debt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But we are putting our energy companies out of business.,0,0,1,0,1,0
We have to bring back our workers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.",0,0,1,1,1,1
We have to guard our energy companies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to make it possible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's a disgrace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Your time is up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's an absolute disgrace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And actually -- well, that was very interesting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.",0,0,1,1,1,1
That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.",0,1,0,0,1,0
We are not dependent upon the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.,0,0,1,0,1,1
So the price of oil has been way down.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?",0,0,1,1,0,1
"We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And I think that's an important transition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to remain energy-independent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.",0,0,0,0,0,1

I don't want to walk away from them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we've got to do something for them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the price of coal is down worldwide.,0,0,1,0,1,1
So we have to look at this comprehensively.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Your time is up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's exactly what I have proposed.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Time is up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have time for one more...,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Look, I respect his children.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I consider that a compliment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will say this about Hillary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She doesn't quit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She doesn't give up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I respect that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I tell it like it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's a fighter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I consider that to be a very good trait.,0,0,0,0,0,0

And neither party has seen this yet.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"These candidates are both running for the Democratic nomination, but they are very different from each other when it comes to what matters most and how they would go about the job of being president.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Our job tonight is to draw out those differences so you, the voters, can understand them and be fully informed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we do hope that the candidates will take this opportunity to show us the distinctions—show us the differences between them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the whole reason that we're here tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're not here for talking points.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're to learn about the difference between the candidates.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Millions of Americans are giving up on the political process.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And they're giving up on the political process because they understand the economy is rigged.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They are working longer hours for low wages.,0,1,0,1,1,1
"They're worried about the future of their kids, and yet almost all new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent.",1,1,0,0,1,1
Not what America is supposed to be about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not the fairness that we grew up believing that America was about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then sustaining that rigged economy is a corrupt campaign finance system undermining American democracy, where billionaire, Wall Street, corporate America can contribute unlimited sums of money into super PACs and into candidates.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Our job, together, is to end a rigged economy, create an economy that works for all, and absolutely overturn Citizens United.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One person, one vote.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what American democracy is about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm happy to be here in New Hampshire for this debate, as we move toward the primary on Tuesday.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe that America has the opportunity to once again live by our values, live up to our values in the 21st century, but I think that America can only do that if Americans can succeed.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And there are lots of reasons why Americans today are feeling left out and left behind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, of course, the economy has not been working for most Americans.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Yes, of course, we have special interests that are unfortunately doing too much to rig the game.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But there's also the continuing challenges of racism, of sexism, of discrimination against the LGBT community, of the way that we treat people as opposed to how we want to be treated.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that we can get back on the right track.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to imagine a country where people's wages reflect their hard work, where we have healthcare for everyone, and where every child gets to live up to his or her potential.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I'm fighting for people who cannot wait for those changes, and I'm not making promises that I cannot keep.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's get started.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, last night you cited the Concord Monitor when you said of Senator Sanders that, quote, ""It's very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable.""",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So please tell us why you think if he's elected president on a platform of promising things like free public college and universal healthcare, that he cannot achieve those things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me start by saying that Senator Sanders and I share some very big progressive goals.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've been fighting for universal healthcare for many years, and we're now on the path to achieving it.",0,0,0,0,1,0
I don't want us to start over again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that would be a great mistake, to once again plunge our country into a contentious debate about whether we should have and what kind of system we should have for healthcare.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to build on the progress we've made; got from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent coverage.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And I don't want to rip away the security that people finally have; 18 million people now have healthcare; preexisting conditions are no longer a bar.,0,0,0,0,1,1
So we have a difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I also believe in affordable college, but I don't believe in free college, because every expert that I have talked to says, look, how will you ever control the costs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"What I want to do is make sure middle class kids, not Donald Trump's kids, get to be able to afford college.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to get the economy going again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's not just enough about what we're against, as important as that is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have a plan to create new jobs, manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy jobs that will make us the 21st century clean energy super power.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I also want to make sure small businesses can start and grow again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And of course, I believe in raising the minimum wage and equal pay for work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the numbers just don't add up, from what Senator Sanders has been proposing.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"That's why all of the independent experts, all of the editorial boards that have vetted both of us have concluded that it is just not achievable.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Let's go down a path where we can actually tell people what we will do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A progressive is someone who makes progress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what I intend to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, so just explain how you spent nearly two decades in Congress and haven't gotten any of these things passed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why do you think as president you'll be able to achieve big, big new programs like this?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I haven't quite run for president before.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ laughter and applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's deal with some of the comments that Secretary Clinton made.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, you know, sometimes there's a lot of drama here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have known Secretary Clinton for 25 years and respect her very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here is the issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Every major country on earth, whether it's the U.K., whether it's France, whether it's Canada, has managed to provide healthcare to all people as a right and they are spending significantly less per capita on health care than we are.",0,0,1,0,1,1
So I do not accept the belief that the United States of America can't do that.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I do not accept the belief that the United States of America and our government can't stand up to the ripoffs of the pharmaceutical industry which charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Number two, in the economy today, everybody understands that we need a well educated workforce.",0,0,0,0,0,1
This is 2016.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we talk about public education, it can no longer be K through 12th grade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do believe that public colleges and universities should be tuition free.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, how do we pay for that?",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's an expensive proposition.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I do believe that we should substantially lower student debt in this country, which is crushing millions of people.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We pay for it, in my view, by a tax on Wall Street speculation.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The middle class bailed out Wall Street in their time of need.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Now, it is Wall Street's time to help the middle class.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
If I could just follow up on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care, the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I want to improve it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I want to build on it, get the costs down, get prescription drug costs down.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders wants us to start all over again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This was a major achievement of President Obama, of our country.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It is helping people right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Let's make the Affordable Care Act work for everybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
... this is a good discussion here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And let me just say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As Secretary Clinton may know, I am on the Health Education Labor Committee.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That committee wrote the Affordable Care Act.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The idea I would dismantle health care in America while we're waiting to pass a Medicare for all is just not accurate.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The Affordable Care Act has clearly, as Secretary Clinton made the point, done a lot of good things, but, what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance, we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"So I do believe that in the future, not by dismantling what we have here—I helped write that bill—but by moving forward, rallying the American people, I do believe we should have health care for all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, thank you both.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Rachel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders is campaigning against you now, at this point in the campaign, basically arguing that you are not progressive enough to be the Democratic nominee.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"He has said that if you voted for the Iraq war, if you are in favor of the death penalty, if you wobbled on things like the Keystone Pipeline or TPP, if you said single payer health care could never happen, then you're too far to the right of the Democratic Party to be the party's standard bearer.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Given those policy positions, why should liberal Democrats support you and not Senator Sanders?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Well because I am a progressive who gets things done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the root of that word, progressive, is progress.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I've heard Senator Sanders comments, and it's really caused me to wonder who's left in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under his definition, President Obama is not progressive because he took donations from Wall Street; Vice President Biden is not progressive because she supported Keystone; Senator Shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for DOMA.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"You know, we have differences and, honestly, I think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if we're going to get into labels, I don't think it was particularly progressive to vote against the Brady Bill five times.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I don't think it was progressive to vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we could go back and forth like this, but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we've done and what we will do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why I am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress, get more jobs with rising incomes, get us to universal health care coverage, get us to universal pre-k, paid family leave and the other elements of what I think will build a strong economy, that will ensure Americans keep making progress.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's what I'm offering and that's what I will do as president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, have you established a list of what it means to be a progressive that is unrealistic?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, not at all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's the reality of American economic life today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The reality is that we have one of lowest voter turnouts of any major country on earth because so many people have given up on the political process.,0,0,0,1,1,1
The reality is that there has been trillions of dollars of wealth going from the middle class in the last 30 years to the top 1/10th of 1 percent.,0,1,0,0,1,1
The reality is we that have a corrupt campaign finance system which separates the American people's needs and desires from what Congress is doing.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"So to my mind, what we have got to do is wage a political revolution where millions of people have given up on the political process, stand up and fight back, demand the government that represents us and not just a handful of campaign contribution—contributors.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now all of the ideas that I'm talking about, they are not radical ideas.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Making public colleges and universities tuition free, that exists in countries all over the world, used to exist in the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, and creating 13 million jobs by doing away with tax loopholes that large corporations now enjoy by putting their money into the Cayman Islands and other tax havens.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That is not a radical idea.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"What we need to do is to stand up to the big money interests, and the campaign contributors.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we do that, we can, in fact, transform America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you Senator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd like to follow up on a comment that Secretary Clinton said, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
President Obama has not called for abolishing the death penalty.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"President Obama is for the big Asian trade deal known as TPP, and just yesterday you said you can't be both a moderate or a progressive, but you can't be both.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Is President Obama, in your judgment, based on these policies positions, a progressive?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just pick up on this point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This whole discussion began because I commented, not making overall evaluation about the Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"She was in Ohio, I think, in September or November and she got up and said something like, I have been—I'm paraphrasing, I have been criticized because people think I'm a moderate.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, I am a moderate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's where this came from.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It wasn't me paraphrasing her.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is what she said, and all that I said was there's nothing wrong with being a moderate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, you can't be a moderate, you can't a progressive.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In terms of President Obama, I think if we remember where this country was seven years ago, 800,000 jobs being lost every month, $1.4 trillion dollar deficit.",0,0,1,1,1,1
The world's financial system on the verge of collapse.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"I think that President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate have done a fantastic job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are in much better shape than we were seven years ago, although my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten where we were seven years ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's the fact, but, we still have a very long way to go.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do I think President Obama is a progressive?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I disagree with him on a number of issues including the trade agreement.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"But, yes, I think he has done an excellent job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Chuck...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"...Secretary Clinton, go ahead...",0,0,0,0,0,0
...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I could, you know, in the very first debate I was asked am I a moderate or a progressive and I said I'm a progressive who likes to get things done.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The American people can judge.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Six largest financial institutions in America today have assets of roughly $10 trillion; equivalent to 58 percent of the GDP of the United States of America.,0,0,1,0,1,1
That is a lot of money.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"They issue two thirds of the credit cards, and by the way they're ripping off a whole lot of people with high interest rates on the credit cards, and they write about one third of the mortgages.",0,0,1,1,1,1
That is a lot of power for six financial institutions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it is too much power.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But, let's make that bigger.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you willing to release the transcripts of all your paid speeches?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We do know through reporting that there were transcription services for all of those paid speeches.,0,0,1,0,1,1

"Yeah, I do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I agree with much of what the Secretary said, but, madam Secretary, it is not one streak.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Wall Street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's a fact.,0,0,0,0,1,0

"In a sense, in my view, the business model of Wall Street is fraud.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It's fraud.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"I believe that corruption is rampant, and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the United States government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once, if we don't start breaking them up, we're going to have to bail them out again, and I do not want to see that happen...",0,0,1,1,1,1
"... Well, Senator, no one wants to see that happen.",0,0,0,1,0,0

We have no disagreement about this.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now explain to me how that makes any sense at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So what I have said with regard to Boeing and GE and other multinationals that pay zero taxes, you know what we're going to do?",0,0,0,0,0,1
We're going to end that loophole.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They are going to pay their fair share of taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We're going to use that money to rebuild our infrastructure and create up to 13 million jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Can I work with corporations?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are there good corporations doing incredible cutting edge research and development?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely they are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we should be proud of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Is President Obama right to keep escalating the number of U.S. troops that's fighting ISIS right now?,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Well, I think what the president understands, and what he's trying to do, is that we have to support the Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with the president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've said myself, we will not send American combat troops back to either Syria or Iraq—that is off the table.",0,0,0,1,1,1

"And I think that, given the threat that ISIS poses to the region and beyond, as we have sadly seen in our own country, it is important to keep the Iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory, to work with the Sunni tribes in Anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed, to work with the Kurds to provide them the support, but they're doing the fighting.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We're doing the support and enabling.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I also think we've got to do more to stop foreign fighters, foreign funding and take ISIS on online, as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I think he hit the nail on the head.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what he said is essentially the war against ISIS is a war for the soul of Islam.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it must be Muslim troops on the ground that will destroy ISIS, with the support of a coalition of major powers—U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Russia.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So our job is to provide them the military equipment that they need; the air support they need; special forces when appropriate.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0

We cannot be the policeman of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Number one, too many innocent people, including minorities, African Americans, have been executed when they were not guilty.",0,0,1,1,1,1
That's number one.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"On the Flint lead poisoning disaster, you have both been highly critical of Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan, and how the state in Michigan both caused the lead poisoning problem, and has not acted fast enough to fix it.",0,0,0,1,1,1
You have both been outspoken on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The fact is that Michigan though has not fixed it.,0,0,0,0,1,1
There is no door to door delivery of clean water in Flint even today.,0,0,0,0,1,1

This is an emergency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Everyday that goes by that these people, particularly the children, are not tested so we can know what steps must be taken to try to remediate the effects of the poisoning that they have been living with is a day lost in a child's life.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I know from the work that I've done over so many years, lead, the toxic nature of lead can affect you brain development, your body development, your behavior.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I absolutely believe that what is being done is not sufficient.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need to be absolutely clear about everything that should be done from today to tomorrow, into the future to try to remedy the terrible burden that the people of Flint are barring.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That includes fixing their pipes, it includes guaranteeing whatever healthcare and educational embellishments they may need going forward, and I think the federal government has way where it can bill the state of Michigan.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"President Obama could be ordering, done, right now, in Flint, Michigan that are not being done that you as President would do?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the Secretary described the situation appropriately.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I don't go around asking for governor's resignations every day.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, I think I never have in my life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I did ask for the resignation of Governor Snyder because his irresponsibility...,0,0,0,1,0,0

...was so outrageous.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What we are talking about are children being poisoned.,0,0,0,1,0,0

"We don't know, no one knows for sure because they haven't done the appropriate studies, but there's no question that kids' intellectual development may have been impacted.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We don't know how many thousands.,0,0,1,0,0,1
The idea that there has not been a dramatic response is beyond comprehension.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when you have one of the, I think, significant public health crises of recent years, of course the federal government comes in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And of course the federal government says, you're not going to be poisoning little kids and impacting their entire lives.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Last point on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I suspect the secretary agrees.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One wonders if this were a white suburban community what kind of response there would have been.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Flint, Michigan, is a poor community.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It is disproportionately African-American and minority.,0,0,0,1,1,1
And what has happened there is absolutely unacceptable.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Senator, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, let me turn to the issue of trade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In the '90s you supported NAFTA.,0,1,0,0,1,0
But you opposed it when you ran for the president in 2008.,0,1,0,1,1,0
"As secretary of state, you supported TPP, and then—which, of course, is that trade agreement with a lot of Asian countries, but you now oppose it as you make your second bid for president.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"If elected, should Democrats expect that once you're in office you will then become supportive of these trade agreements again?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Chuck, I've only had responsibility for voting for trade agreements as a senator.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I voted a multinational trade agreement when I was senator, the CAFTA agreement, because I did not believe it was in the best interests of the workers of America, of our incomes, and I opposed it.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"I did hope that the TPP, negotiated by this administration, would put to rest a lot of the concerns that many people have expressed about trade agreements.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I said that I was holding out that hope that it would be the kind of trade agreement that I was looking for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I waited until it had actually been negotiated because I did want to give the benefit of the doubt to the administration.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Once I saw what the outcome was, I opposed it.",0,1,0,0,1,0
Now I have a very clear view about this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to trade with the rest of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We are 5 percent of the world's population.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We have to trade with the other 95 percent.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And trade has to be reciprocal.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's the way the global economy works.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy.,0,0,0,0,1,0
So it's not just what's in the trade agreement that I'm interested in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I did help to renegotiate the trade agreement that we inherited from President Bush with Korea.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We go the UAW on board because of changes we made.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"So there are changes that I believe would make a real difference if they could be achieved, but I do not currently support it as it is written.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Senator Sanders, I know you want to respond on this, you have never supported a trade deal since you've been in Congress.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Absolutely right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But if you do that as president...,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you do that as president, how are you not essentially letting China, who will do all of these deals around the world, how are you going to prevent China from essentially setting the rules of trade for the world?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Chuck, I believe in trade, but I do not believe in unfettered free trade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families of this country and not just large multinational corporations.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I was not only in opposition to NAFTA—and this is an area where the secretary and I have disagreements.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"I was not only in opposition to NAFTA, I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA because I understood—I don't think this is really rocket science.",0,0,0,0,1,0
We heard all of the people tell us how many great jobs would be created.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I didn't believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, it's to say to American workers, hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.",0,1,1,1,1,1
I don't want American workers to compete against people making 56 cents an hour.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"I don't want companies shutting down in America, throwing people out on the street, moving to China, and bringing their products back into this country.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So, do I believe in trade?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course, I believe in trade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the current trade agreements over the last 30 years were written by corporate America, for corporate America, resulted in the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decent-paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race to the bottom where employers say, ""Hey, you don't want to take a cut in pay?",0,1,1,1,1,1
"We're going to China.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
Workers today are working longer hours for lower wages.,1,1,0,0,1,1
Trade is one of the reasons for that.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"We're going to sneak in one more break here, and when we come back we'll squeeze as many questions as we can before we end this thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The home stretch.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The home stretch of this only Democratic debate in the final week before the primary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me start with you, Secretary Clinton, on this question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obviously, President Obama got a lot of ambitious stuff done in his first year and a half.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You're going to have to make choices.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there's a lot of heavy lifts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And he made choices.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He did healthcare and it came at the expense, arguably, of immigration reform.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Had he put immigration reform first, perhaps that gets done and healthcare doesn't.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So there are three big lifts that you've talked about: immigration, gun reform, climate change.",0,0,0,0,1,0
What do you do first?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because you know the first one is the one you have the best shot at getting done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I—I don't accept that premise, Chuck.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that we've got so much business we have to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've talked a lot tonight about what we're against—we're against income inequality.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're against the abuses of powerful interests.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're against a lot of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm for a lot of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't want to just stop bad things from happening, I want to start good things from happening.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I believe, if I'm so fortunate to get the nomination, I will begin to work immediately on putting together an agenda, beginning to talk with members of Congress and others about how we can push forward.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to have half a billion more solar panels deployed, the first four years.",0,0,0,0,0,1

I want to have enough clean energy to power every home the next four years.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I want to move forward on paid family leave, on early childhood education, I want us to do more for small businesses.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Small businesses have to create most of the jobs, and we're not creating and growing small businesses.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think, if you have a smart agenda, you pick the committees that you know have to begin to work on these various pieces—because that's the way Congress is set up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You go through different committees, and you really make a big push in the beginning.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Immigration reform, economic revitalization with manufacturing, with infrastructure—we put it out there, and we begin to work on an ambitious, big, bold agenda that will actually produce the results that I want to see for our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, but Senator Sanders...",0,0,0,1,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
...you've still got to do something first.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As you know, history said—shows what you pick first is your best shot at getting, and how you prioritize things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, let...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Immigration reform, for instance, fell by the wayside in the first term because of this.",0,0,0,0,1,1
...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am absolutely supportive of comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We got to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you miss—when you looked at the issues, you missed two of the most important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is you're not going to accomplish what has to be done for working families and the middle class unless there is campaign finance reform.,0,0,0,1,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"So long as big money interests control the United States Congress, it is gonna be very hard to do what has to be done for working families.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So let me be very clear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No nominee of mine, if I'm elected president, to the United States Supreme Court will get that nomination unless he or she is loud and clear, and says they will vote to overturn Citizens United.",0,0,0,1,0,1
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Second point—second point is that the only way we make change in terms of health care, in terms of dealing with a broken criminal justice system which, today, allows us to have more people in jail than any other country—largely African-American and Latino—the only way we create millions of jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure or have a tax system that says to the wealthy that they are going to pay their fair share, is when millions of people become involved in the political process.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"No, you just can't negotiate with Mitch McConnell.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Mitch is gonna have to look out the window and see a whole lot of people saying, ""Mitch, stop representing the billionaire class.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Secretary Clinton, Republicans, particularly in campaign years, often talk about which departments of government—which agencies of government they would get rid of if they were elected president.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"The EPA, the Department of Education, the Commerce Department, oops—is—is there a department of government that you would get rid of?",0,0,0,1,0,1
Or is there a whole new one that you would create?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The answer to both of those is no.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm interested in making what we have work better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to streamline programs that are duplicative and redundant.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I want to have a top-to-bottom review about what works and what doesn't work, and be absolutely clear we're getting rid of what doesn't work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have had the opportunity to run a big agency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better—better than anybody had run it in a long time.,0,0,0,0,1,0
So I have an idea of what it's going to take to make our government work more efficiently.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when you put together a budget, you have to make a lot of hard decisions, but I think it's not appropriate to say ""I'm going to get rid of this, get rid of that"" until you have a very good process that gives you the information about what to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to add something else, you know, because look, we have so much work to do in our country, and I think it's the greatest work that Americans will be called to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And of course, we have to have people in every community involved in it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to have the political voice, the political grassroots speaking up and speaking out about what we have to try to accomplish in Washington.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we also need to have a very clear set of goals that we are going to achieve, and we need to level with the American people about what they are, what they will cost, what will be expected of our citizenry.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I see as president having a constant dialogue with Americans here's what we're trying to get done, here's why I need your help, here's why you may think comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship isn't something you care about, but I'm telling you it will help fix the labor market, it will bring people out of the shadows—",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
—it will actually raise wages.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have to make all those connections so that you've got people with you every step of the way.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Secretary Clinton, you've made it clear when you look at Senator Sanders, you do not see a president, but do you see—",0,0,0,0,0,1
I never said that.,0,0,1,0,1,0
But do you see—do you see a vice president?,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ laughter ],0,0,0,0,0,0
Look...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Would you unite the party by trying to pick Senator Sanders as your running mate?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm certainly going to unite the party, but I'm not—I'm not getting ahead of myself.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that would be a little bit presumptuous.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I'm so fortunate as to be the nominee, the first person I will call to talk to about where we go and how we get it done will be Senator Sanders.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Senator, would you consider the secretary?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with what the secretary said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We shouldn't be getting ahead of ourselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I happen to respect the secretary very much, I hope it's mutual.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Yes, we have income inequality, we have other forms of inequality that we need to stand up against and absolutely diminish from our society.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So I have been moved by my heart ever since I was a young woman about the age of a lot of Senator Sanders' supporters worrying what I can do to make a difference for my country, and I will bring that heart with me, but I will also tell you we've got to get our heads together to come up with the best answers to solve the problems so that people can have real differences in their lives that will make them better for now and into the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"How are you, Donald?",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Good luck to you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Candidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, let's begin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're calling this opening segment ""Achieving Prosperity.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
And central to that is jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are two economic realities in America today.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want us to invest in you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want us to invest in your future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We also have to make the economy fairer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How are we going to do it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, the same question to you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have up to two minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Lester.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our jobs are fleeing the country.,0,0,1,0,1,1
They're going to Mexico.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They're going to many other countries.,0,0,1,0,1,1
You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And we have a very good fight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have a winning fight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.",1,0,0,1,1,1
"So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"With the United States, as he said, not so much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So Ford is leaving.,0,1,1,0,1,0
"You see that, their small car division leaving.",0,1,1,0,1,0
"Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.",0,1,1,0,1,0
They're all leaving.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And we can't allow it to happen anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They left -- fired 1,400 people.",0,0,1,1,1,1
They're going to Mexico.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.,0,0,1,0,0,1
We cannot let it happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Companies will come.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They will build.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They will expand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
New companies will start.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I look very, very much forward to doing it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think that trade is an important issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.",1,0,1,1,1,1
"I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.",0,0,0,1,0,0
That is not how we grow the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I understand that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.",0,1,0,0,1,1
I don't buy that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a different experience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My father was a small-businessman.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He worked really hard.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans.",0,0,0,0,1,1
How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.",0,1,0,0,0,1
Our country's in deep trouble.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"They're the best, the best ever at it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.",0,0,0,1,0,0
So we have to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to renegotiate our trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Let me give you the example of Mexico.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They have a VAT tax.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We're on a different system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"When they sell into us, there's no tax.",0,0,0,0,1,1
It's a defective agreement.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want you to be very happy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's very important to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.",0,0,0,0,0,1
She's been doing this for 30 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And why hasn't she made the agreements better?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The NAFTA agreement is defective.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me interrupt just a moment, but...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They should have been doing this for years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"We cannot do it any longer, Lester.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Back to the question, though.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?",0,0,0,0,0,0
How do you make them bring the jobs back?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The companies are leaving.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We wish you a lot of luck.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to stop them from leaving.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's a big, big factor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"He said, back in 2006, ""Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.""",1,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, it did collapse.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"That's called business, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Five million people lost their homes.,0,0,1,0,1,1
And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"Now, we have come back from that abyss.",0,0,0,0,1,0
And it has not been easy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.",0,1,1,0,1,1
Take clean energy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.,1,1,1,1,1,1
I think it's real.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I did not.,0,0,1,0,1,0
I did not.,0,0,1,0,1,0
I do not say that.,1,0,1,0,1,0
I think science is real.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do not say that.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And here's what we can do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We can have enough clean energy to power every home.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can build a new modern electric grid.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0
She talks about solar panels.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We invested in a solar company, our country.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That was a disaster.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They lost plenty of money on that one.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Our energy policies are a disaster.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.",0,0,1,1,1,1
You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.",1,0,0,0,1,1
So I will tell you this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You've been doing this for 30 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Well, actually...",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will bring -- excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will bring back jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can't bring back jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, for 30 years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I have -- well, not quite that long.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, he approved NAFTA...",0,1,0,0,1,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"million new jobs, a balanced budget...",0,0,1,0,0,0
"He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.",0,1,1,0,1,1
Incomes went up for everybody.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Will they create jobs in America?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Will they raise incomes in America?,0,0,1,0,0,0
And are they good for our national security?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Some of them I voted for.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.",1,0,0,0,1,1
And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to have a special prosecutor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We increased them to China 50 percent.,0,0,1,0,1,1
So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Very quickly...,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Well, I've been a senator, Donald...",0,0,0,0,0,0
You haven't done it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You haven't done it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have been a secretary of state...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have done a lot...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.",0,1,0,0,1,1
"Well, that's your opinion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is your opinion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.",1,0,1,1,1,1
"NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You were totally in favor of it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Nothing will ever top NAFTA.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, that is just not accurate.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.,0,0,1,0,1,1
I wrote about that in...,0,0,0,0,0,0
You called it the gold standard.,0,1,1,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
You called it the gold standard of trade deals.,1,1,1,0,0,0
You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.,1,1,0,0,0,1
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...",0,0,1,0,1,1
Not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I wrote about that in my book...,0,0,0,0,0,0
So is it President Obama's fault?,0,0,0,1,0,0
before you even announced.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is it President Obama's fault?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Look, there are differences...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because he's pushing it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.",0,0,0,0,1,1
But you have no plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"It's called ""Stronger Together.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's about all you've...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Folks, we're going to...",0,0,0,0,0,0
or at an airport near you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to move to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we have a very robust set of plans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.",0,0,1,1,1,1
You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.,0,0,1,0,1,1
You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.,0,0,1,0,1,1
You are going to drive business out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.",0,1,1,0,1,1
I'm very proud of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I'm going to cut regulations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to talk taxes...,0,0,0,0,0,0
That can't -- that can't be left to stand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...",0,0,0,1,0,1
Facts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because what I have proposed...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.",0,0,1,1,1,1
What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you just opened the next segment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, could I just finish -- I think I...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to give you a chance right here...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.",0,0,0,0,0,0
with a new 15-minute segment...,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Mr. Trump, I'm going to...",0,0,0,0,0,0
And look at her website.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's no difference than this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's telling us how to fight ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just go to her website.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.,0,0,0,1,0,0

"No, we're not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.",0,0,0,1,0,0
No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"OK, you are unpacking a lot here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I want to talk about taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans.",0,0,0,1,1,1
I'd like you to further defend that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy.",0,0,0,1,1,1
I'd like you to defend that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They're going to expand their companies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're going to do a tremendous job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's a great thing for the middle class.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a great thing for companies to expand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.",0,0,1,1,1,0
Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And here's the thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.",0,0,1,0,1,1
I happen to think it's double that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have no leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why not?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why not?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, why not?",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...",0,0,0,1,0,0
There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've looked at your tax proposals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I happen to support that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then you didn't read it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.",0,0,0,0,1,0
You've proposed an approach that has a...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Who gave it that name?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The first I've -- who gave it that name?,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
$4 billion tax benefit for your family.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And when you look at what you are proposing...,0,0,0,0,0,0
How much?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How much for my family?,0,0,0,0,0,0
it is...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Lester, how much?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Trickle-down did not work.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think top-down works in America.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, we're...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Typical politician.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All talk, no action.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Sounds good, doesn't work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Never going to happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we better be awfully careful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have a Fed that's doing political things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This Janet Yellen of the Fed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest?,0,0,0,1,0,1
I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And it'll be released.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.",0,1,1,1,1,1
You know what that is?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?",0,0,0,1,0,0
We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The IRS says an audit...,0,0,0,0,0,1
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.",0,0,1,0,1,0
I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"I said, do you get audited?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I get audited almost every year.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And in a way, I should be complaining.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I'm not even complaining.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't mind it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's almost become a way of life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I get audited by the IRS.,0,0,0,0,1,1
But other people don't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"As soon as she releases them, I will release.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I will release my tax returns.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will tell you this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"When the audit's complete, I'll do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.,0,0,0,1,0,0
So it's negotiable?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's not negotiable, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let her release the e-mails.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why did she delete 33,000...",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Well, I'll let her answer that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me just admonish the audience one more time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There was an agreement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think there may be a couple of reasons.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.",1,1,1,1,1,1
That makes me smart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.",0,0,0,1,0,1
They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And we'll guess.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Who does he owe money to?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you want to respond to that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.",0,0,0,1,0,0
That's for sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm not going to make any excuses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was more than a mistake.,0,0,0,1,0,0
That was done purposely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was not a mistake.,0,0,0,1,0,0
That was done purposely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.",0,1,1,1,1,0
"And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.",0,1,0,0,0,0
That I can tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You learn a lot from financial disclosure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you should go down and take a look at that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.",0,0,0,1,1,1
It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And the $650 isn't even on that.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But it's not $650.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It's much less than that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I could do that very quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am very underleveraged.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I have a great company.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a tremendous income.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Our airports are like from a third world country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So the worst of all things has happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.",0,0,0,1,1,1
We haven't even started.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And it's really a shame.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Our country has tremendous problems.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We're a debtor nation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're a serious debtor nation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.",0,0,0,1,1,0
We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.,0,0,0,0,1,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And the other thing I think is important...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It would be squandered, too, believe me.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"Which our country should do, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?",0,0,1,1,0,0

There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You call yourself the King of Debt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You talk about leverage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.,1,0,0,1,1,1
Wrong.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Wrong.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's let Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we need to be very clear about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I built an unbelievable company.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's an unbelievable company.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.",0,1,0,0,1,1
"And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's what I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0

And we should be able to do that for our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We move into our next segment talking about America's direction.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And let's start by talking about race.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So how do you heal the divide?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you're right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Race remains a significant challenge in our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And we've got to do several things at the same time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to restore trust between communities and the police.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.",0,0,0,0,1,0
I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.",1,0,1,1,1,1
"So we have to do two things, as I said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to restore trust.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to work with the police.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How do you heal the divide?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we need law and order.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"You walk down the street, you get shot.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Thousands of shootings.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I'm saying, where is this?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Is this a war-torn country?,0,0,1,0,0,0
What are we doing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have to stop the violence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to bring back law and order.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.",0,1,1,1,1,1
We have to bring back law and order.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It brought the crime rate way down.,0,0,0,1,1,0
But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have gangs roaming the street.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And they have guns.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And they shoot people.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And we have to be very strong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have to be very vigilant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"No, you're wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.",0,0,1,1,1,0
It was taken away from her.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.",0,0,0,1,1,1
They would have won an appeal.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.",0,0,0,0,1,1
The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.",0,0,0,1,0,0
These are felons.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.",0,0,0,1,1,1
You need more police.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You need a better community, you know, relation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't have good community relations in Chicago.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It's terrible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have property there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You need better relationships.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.",0,0,1,1,0,1
So there's some bad things going on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Some really bad things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Ugh.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.",0,1,0,1,1,0
It did not do what it needed to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I believe in community policing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Property crime is down 40 percent.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We just don't want to see it creep back up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.",1,0,1,1,1,1
So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We cannot just say law and order.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We need to have more second chance programs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.,0,0,1,0,1,1
You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.,0,0,0,1,0,0
So there are some positive ways we can work on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They admit it's an issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They've got a lot of concerns.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to respond to that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I agree with you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I think you've apologized for it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But I think it was a terrible thing to say.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we went from 2,200 to 500.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And it was terminated by current mayor.,0,0,1,0,1,1
But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.,0,0,1,0,1,0
Tremendous beyond belief.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when you say it has no impact, it really did.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"It had a very, very big impact.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.",0,1,1,0,1,1
So there is...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, you're wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You're wrong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I'm not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Murders are up.,0,1,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You check it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
New York -- New York has done an excellent job.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, one murder is too many.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This conversation is about race.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd like to just respond, if I might.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Please -- 20 seconds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd just like to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.",0,0,0,1,0,0

They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Mr. Trump, let me...",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, I -- I do think...",0,0,0,0,0,0

"You decided to stay home, and that's OK.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you, I've been all over.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Mr. Trump, I...",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And, yes, I did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you know what else I prepared for?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I prepared to be president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that's a good thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen.",0,0,0,1,1,1
You questioned his legitimacy.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Can you tell us what took you so long?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.",0,1,1,0,1,1

I got him to give the birth certificate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I'm satisfied with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will let you respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I just want to get the answer here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The birth certificate was produced in 2011.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15...",0,0,0,0,0,1

"So the question is, what changed your mind?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But nobody was caring much about it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think I did a good job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton also fought it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Look, it's true.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.",0,1,0,0,1,1
And she was involved.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I'm sorry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we're talking about racial healing in this segment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What do you say to Americans, people of color who...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it was very -- I say nothing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He should have produced it a long time before.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I say nothing.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But let me just tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you can see that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, just listen to what you heard.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But it can't be dismissed that easily.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.",1,0,1,1,1,1
He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.,0,0,1,1,1,1
So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.,0,0,0,1,1,0
And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would love to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You treated him with terrible disrespect.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It doesn't work that way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.",0,0,1,1,1,0
I don't think you can deny that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It really doesn't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.",0,0,1,1,1,1
We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.,0,0,1,0,1,1
It was very easy to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I notice you bring that up a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Maybe I'm trying to save the money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.",0,0,1,1,1,1
I'll go one step further.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's a tremendously successful club.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm so glad I did it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have been given great credit for what I did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'm very, very proud of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the way I feel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is the true way I feel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our next segment is called ""Securing America.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"So my question is, who's behind it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And how do we fight it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.",0,0,0,1,0,0
There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.",0,0,0,1,1,1
The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...",0,0,1,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"tough, long game here.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But we will defend the citizens of this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the Russians need to understand that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.,1,0,0,1,1,0
That is just unacceptable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...,0,0,0,1,1,1
Your two minutes have expired.,0,0,0,0,0,1
have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.,0,0,0,1,1,0
It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Who's behind it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And how do we fight it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"That just happened, and many more are coming.",0,0,0,0,1,0
And I'm very proud of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.,0,0,1,1,1,1
I was just endorsed by ICE.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because look at the mess that we're in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Look at the mess that we're in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.",0,0,1,1,0,1
It could also be lots of other people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?",0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't know who broke in to DNC.,0,0,1,1,0,1
But what did we learn with DNC?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Look what happened to her.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what we learned.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.",0,0,0,0,1,1
ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is -- it is a huge problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a son.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's 10 years old.,0,0,0,0,0,1
He has computers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And maybe it's hardly doable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.,0,0,0,0,1,0
It does involve going after them online.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We're making progress.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Our military is assisting in Iraq.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando.",0,0,0,1,1,1
I'll ask this to both of you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.,0,0,0,1,1,0
We will take out ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And ISIS was formed.,0,0,1,0,1,0
So she talks about taking them out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's been doing it a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's been trying to take them out for a long time.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And then you wouldn't have had them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.,0,0,1,0,1,0
Wrong.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That is absolutely proved over and over again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wrong.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Wrong.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.",1,0,0,0,1,0
"But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the most important part of this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How do we prevent attacks?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How do we protect our people?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they brought him down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.",0,0,0,0,1,0
They're on the front lines.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I have to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Please respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Under your direction, to a large extent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.",0,0,0,0,1,1
They were choking on the sanctions.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I did really well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I have common sense.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I said, well, I'll tell you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But two things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And I was very strong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I said it numerous times.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And I think that's great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.,0,0,1,0,1,1
It's a lot of money to protect other people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm all for NATO.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I said they have to focus on terror, also.",1,0,0,0,0,0
And they're going to do that.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.,1,0,1,1,0,0
"I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Not only that, you named the day.",0,1,0,0,0,0
They couldn't believe it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They said...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Lester, we've covered...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, wait a minute.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've covered this ground.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It should have never happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Now it's in over 30 countries.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And you're going to stop them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion.,0,0,0,0,1,1
What makes your...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I did not support the war in Iraq.,1,0,1,1,1,0
In 2002...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"My question is, since you supported it...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Just -- would you like to hear...,0,0,0,0,0,0
why is your -- why is your judgment...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait a minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was against the war in Iraq.,0,1,0,0,1,0
Just so you put it out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was...",0,0,0,1,0,0
The record does not show that.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Why was -- is your judgment any...,0,0,0,0,0,0
The record shows that I'm right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Essentially.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We talked about the economy is more important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.",0,1,0,1,1,0
Why is your judgment better than...,0,0,0,0,0,0
And when he -- excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that was before the war started.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was against the war.,0,1,0,0,1,0

But nobody called Sean Hannity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I think in '04.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.,0,0,0,1,1,0

"But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.",0,0,0,1,0,0
He and I used to have arguments about the war.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to destabilize the Middle East.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And that's exactly what it's done.,0,0,0,0,1,0
It's been a disaster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You didn't hear what I said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I have much better judgment than she does.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There's no question about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.",0,0,1,1,1,1
I have a winning temperament.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know how to win.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She does not have a...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whew, OK.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.",0,0,0,1,1,1
They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.,0,0,0,0,1,1
They had built covert facilities.,0,0,0,0,1,1
They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we had sanctioned them.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.",0,0,0,1,1,1
So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.,0,0,1,1,1,1
And we did drive them to the negotiating table.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.",1,0,1,1,1,1
That's diplomacy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's coalition-building.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's working with other nations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.",0,0,1,1,0,0
That's not good judgment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That would not start a war.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And the worst part...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, they were taunting us.",0,0,0,1,0,0
of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...",0,0,1,1,1,0
Wrong.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"have a good time, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's lies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.",0,0,0,1,0,0
That is the number-one threat we face in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would like to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's a good one, though.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It well describes the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not an accurate one at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not an accurate one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with her on one thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Nuclear is the single greatest threat.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.",1,0,1,0,0,1
They do not pay us.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.",0,0,0,1,1,1
That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...",0,0,1,1,1,1
We need to move on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, wait, but it's very important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're a country that owes $20 trillion.,0,0,0,0,1,1
They have to help us out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our last...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is the single greatest threat that this country has.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Do you support the current policy?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We have not been updating from the new standpoint.,0,0,0,0,1,1
I looked the other night.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.",0,0,1,0,0,1
We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I would certainly not do first strike.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"At the same time, we have to be prepared.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I can't take anything off the table.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.",0,0,0,1,0,1
China should solve that problem for us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
China should go into North Korea.,0,0,1,0,0,0
China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Iran has power over North Korea.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't you add other things into the deal?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.",1,1,0,0,1,0
Nobody's ever seen that before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That turned out to be wrong.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.",0,1,0,1,1,1
It certainly looks that way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.,0,0,1,0,0,1
The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Your two minutes is expired.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And they're going to end up getting nuclear.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Believe me, he's not a happy camper.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Words matter when you run for president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they really matter when you are president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is essential that America's word be good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've talked with a number of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And Donald never tells you what he would do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Would he have started a war?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Would he have bombed Iran?,0,0,1,1,0,0
"If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.",0,0,0,1,1,0
But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.",0,0,1,1,0,0
So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Can they rely on us?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what I intend to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...,0,0,0,1,0,0
Your two minutes is...,0,0,0,0,0,0
to be given any opportunities at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
is expired.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Lester, one thing I'd like to say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Very quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Twenty seconds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will go very quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's a big problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.",0,0,0,1,1,1
We cannot be the policemen of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We cannot protect countries all over the world...,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have just...,0,0,0,0,0,0
where they're not paying us what we need.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have just a few final questions...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We need heart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need a lot of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you have to have some basic ability.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And sadly, she doesn't have that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they weren't taken care of.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, ""a presidential look.""",0,0,0,0,1,0
She's standing here right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What did you mean by that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
She doesn't have the look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She doesn't have the stamina.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I said she doesn't have the stamina.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I don't believe she does have the stamina.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The quote was, ""I just don't think she has the presidential look.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have -- wait a minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wait a minute, Lester.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You asked me a question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did you ask me a question?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?",0,0,1,1,0,0
"And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?",0,0,1,1,0,0
All you have to do is speak to them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's let her respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.",0,0,1,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
The world -- let me tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it's bad, bad experience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.",0,0,1,0,1,1
I agree.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She's got experience, but it's bad experience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are at -- we are at the final question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, one thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One thing, Lester.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Very quickly, because we're at the final question now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...",1,0,1,0,0,0
I never said that.,0,0,1,0,1,0
women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.,0,1,0,0,0,1
I didn't say that.,0,0,1,0,1,0
And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Some of it's said in entertainment.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was going to say something...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please very quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ""I can't do it.",0,0,0,1,0,0

I did everything during the primary season.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"During the election season, for some reason, they should have used me in Florida.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"He thought Donald Trump was too tough and too controversial, and don't use him.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So they didn't use me, and that was okay.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"When it came down to the convention, I wasn't a part of the convention, and that was okay.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What happened is I was rough on Mitt because I didn't think they treated me properly.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I helped him, really helped him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Gave him a lot of money.,0,0,1,0,0,0

I didn't care.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Look, if they don't want to call me, that's okay.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm a busy man.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a lot of things to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if I would have been asked to help him in Florida, you saw what I did in Florida.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I won in a landslide.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I would have helped him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I certainly could have gotten him over the ledge.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Let me--,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait a minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So if Mitt Romney did that, I would be happy to talk to him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it's great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I would be because I respect him,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You want him to thank you first, for 2012, before you will reach out to him--",0,0,0,0,0,0
I helped -- I helped Mitt Romney a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you feel like he was ungrateful--,0,0,0,0,0,0
I did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe I won him, or helped him win, five states that he was going to lose in the primaries, okay--",0,0,0,1,0,0
Sounds like you think he was ungrateful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You think he's been ungrateful?,0,0,0,1,0,0
He was.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He was ungrateful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Which is okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot of people are ungrateful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But he was ungrateful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He did not--They did not respond accordingly.,0,0,0,1,1,0

Alright.,0,0,0,0,0,0

The issue of taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Your tax plan is one where the biggest beneficiaries are the 0.1 percent when it comes to raw dollars that will be saved among taxes.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"But then in an interview earlier this week, you seemed to say, ""You know what, my tax plan, it's not set in stone.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And maybe I'll raise taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Maybe I'll actually raise taxes on the rich.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I guess, which is it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you willing to raise taxes on 0.1 percent or not--,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's definitely-- no, no, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me explain how the world works, okay?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think nobody knows more about taxes than I do, and income than I do.",0,0,1,0,0,0

I come up with the biggest tax cut by far of any candidate.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Anybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I put it in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But that doesn't mean that's what we're going to get.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to negotiate.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"For the wealthy, I think, frankly, it's going to go up.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And you know what, it really should go up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because the wealthy--,0,0,0,1,0,0
The wealthy need to pay more taxes?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What do you define as wealthy, by the way--",0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, let me explain-- somebody like me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me explain something--somebody like me--let me explain something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm putting in a plan, Chuck.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have to negotiate now with senators and congressmen and lots of-- the fact that I put in a plan, it really is a floor.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's what it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Whether we like it or not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I put in my plan.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It's quite simple to see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a simplification.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We lower the number of brackets.,0,1,0,0,1,0
"We lower the taxes on the middle class, on business.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"And we lower the taxes on everybody, very substantially.",0,1,0,0,1,1
But I have no illusions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think that's going to be the final plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because they are going to come to me, including the Democrats and everybody else, they're going to come to me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They're going to want to negotiate.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But that's a floor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's where we're starting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So is that--,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, when it comes time to negotiate, I feel less concerned with the rich than I do with the middle class.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So it sounds like-- should we take that--,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I feel very concerned at that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"--should we assume that most of your plans, then, we shouldn't take you at your word, as sort of that they're floors?",0,0,0,1,0,0
What you just described?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That, ""You know what, it's my opening statement, but everything is negotiable--""",0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s not a word.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's called life, Chuck.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's not my word, of course.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I put in a proposal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what they are?,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're really proposals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People can say it's a tax plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's really a tax proposal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because after I put it in, and I think you know the Senate and Congress--",0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"--you know as much as anybody, they start working with you, and they start fighting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you know, let's see what happens.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I put in a proposal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under my proposal, it's the biggest tax cut by far, of any candidate by far.",1,1,0,0,1,1
But I'm not under the illusion that that's going to pass.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're going to come to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're going to want to raise it for the rich.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Frankly, they're going to want to raise it for the rich more than anybody else.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But the middle class has to be protected.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The rich is probably going to end up paying more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And business might have to pay a little bit more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we're giving a massive business tax cut.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Remember this, we're the highest taxed nation in the world.",1,1,0,0,1,1
"But this is a tax-- Chuck, this is a tax proposal--",0,0,0,1,0,0
Wait a minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me stop you there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You just said, ""Businesses might pay a little bit more.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You just said, ""Business might pay a little bit more, but we're going to get 'em a massive tax cut.""",0,0,1,0,0,1
You just said it within ten words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn't say it.,0,0,1,0,1,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said they might have to pay a little bit more than my proposal, Chuck.",0,0,1,1,1,0
I said they might have--,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Oh, your proposal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just wanted to get that clear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"--yeah, than my proposal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Fair enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not talking about more than they're paying now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Got you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're the highest taxed nation in the world.,1,1,0,0,1,1
Our businesses pay more taxes than any businesses in the world.,1,1,1,0,1,1
That's why companies are leaving.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So they may have to pay a little bit more than my proposal, is what I mean.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I assume you knew that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I assume you know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Got you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, no, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I just wanted to clear that up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Good, I'm glad you cleared it up--",0,0,0,0,0,0
Minimum wage.,0,0,0,0,0,0

You thought you didn't want to touch it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now you're open to it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What changed?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me just tell you, I've been traveling the country for many months.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Since June 16th.,0,0,0,0,1,1
I'm all over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Today I'm in the state of Washington, where the arena right behind me, you probably hear, is packed with thousands and thousands of people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I'm doing that right after I finish you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have seen what's going on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'd rather leave it to the states.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let the states decide.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So you may have a governor --,0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You want the fed-- but should the federal government set a floor, and then you let the states--",0,0,0,1,0,1
"No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So I like the idea of let the states decide.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think people should get more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think they're out there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're working.,0,0,0,0,1,0
It is a very low number.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"You know, with what's happened to the economy, with what's happened to the cost.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, it's just-- I don't know how you live on $7.25 an hour.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But I would say let the states decide.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Another contradiction has been on your feelings toward Hillary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 2012, as she was leaving Secretary of State, you praised her.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You thought she did a good job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You even sort of said, ""You know what, she's not pushing her agenda.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"She had to carry on somebody else's agenda.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Before that, you didn't fault her on the Iraq War vote because you said, ""You know what, she got bad intelligence like a lot of other people got.""",0,0,0,1,1,0
"Now, you're saying--",0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn't get bad intelligence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn't get bad intelligence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
--you say all-- I understand that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you kind of forgave her on that early on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, you call her, ""She's been crooked from the start.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
I guess this goes back to which Donald Trump do we believe on your feelings toward Hillary Clinton--,0,0,0,0,0,0
So let me explain it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
--2012 or now?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Let me just tell you something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to get along with politicians.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when somebody says, ""What do you think of Hillary Clinton?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, I'm not looking at it that closely, because I'm in business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when somebody says, three, four, five years ago, ""Let's look at Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What do you think?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I say, ""She's doing great.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
I say everybody's doing great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The fact is she has not done a good job.,0,0,0,1,0,0

When you look at the migration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
When you look at all of the things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm not looking to criticize.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can look at many politicians that haven't done a good job.,0,0,0,1,0,0
How are they doing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're doing just fine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm not looking to get into wars with politicians, because I need politicians.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, last question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why not release the tax returns that aren't involved in the audit?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because it's a link.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have very big tax returns.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I'm sure you've seen the picture where the returns are literally from the floor to up to here.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They're extremely complex.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I get audited--,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do you think you can do it before the election, though?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have no problem releasing the tax returns--,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you pledge to do it before the election?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think that's totally right.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Donors, it was funny, is it donor generated or was it a message to donors, a message to incumbents who are afraid of running with Trump?",0,0,0,0,0,0

"He has to protect, you know, incumbent Congress members who are concerned about the Donald Trump effect.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So he's basically going to worry about the swing districts, which is his majority, and those in the safe districts can go with Trump or do whatever they have to do.Look, the fact that he changed his position on minimum wage and on his tax proposal in one interview with you, and has also said importantly, he said in the last 48 hours on CNBC that he would let the U.S. default.",0,0,0,1,1,1
He would let the U.S. become Greece.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"When he is saying, ""I'm not going to pay 100% on treasury bonds,"" he is saying something to Republican donors, to the business community, that is so shocking, that if it is widely--",0,0,0,1,0,1

"If I'm Donald Trump, and there are few people I'd less likely be, but if I were Donald Trump, I'd go right into the teeth of that.",0,0,0,0,0,0

He has to run against the entire system and this is an opening for him to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right, but he walks a line when he says these outrageous things that are crazy, perhaps, that we think are crazy, but somehow he never goes too far for his base.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And we continue hearing from commencement speakers from the weekend of the political ilk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's Mitt Romney.,0,0,0,0,0,0

You probably know by now that Donald Trump is behind Hillary Clinton in the polls.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But did you know that the last time a candidate was this far behind at this stage has actually been more than a generation ago?,0,0,0,0,1,1
Let's dive in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted a few weeks ago, we had Donald Trump trailing Hillary Clinton nationally by 11 points, it’s actually particularly an unprecedented number.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Let me compare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, when Mitt Romney clinched the Republican nomination in April of 2012, he trailed President Obama at that point in time by six.",0,0,1,0,1,1
He ended up losing by four.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Senator John McCain started only two points behind Senator Obama in March, 2008, when he had become the presumptive nominee.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Of course, McCain lost by seven.",0,1,1,1,1,0
"John Kerry was behind incumbent George W. Bush at two points in March of '04, the month he became the presumptive nominee.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"By the way, the race essentially stayed in the same place.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Kerry lost by three.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"In 2000, it was March when both Gore and Bush became presumptive nominees of their respective parties.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That first match-up had Bush up 46-41.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Gore made up the ground on the popular vote, but he lost the electoral college and of course Bush won.",0,0,1,1,1,1
You have to go all the way back to 1996 to find a presumptive nominee in worse shape than Trump is right now.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And that was Bob Dole.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He trailed Bill Clinton by 17 points at the start of the general election campaign in May of '96.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"But Dole did make up some ground, but he eventually lost in an electoral landslide by eight points.",0,0,1,0,1,0
So what does this all mean?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump of course was never an underdog in the G.O.P.,0,0,0,0,1,0
primary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He led in nearly every poll after he entered the race.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Many folks just simply thought we should ignore the polls, that the polls were wrong, that they were oversampling Trump voters.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"The polls were right, Trump won.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"But those same polls have all had Trump losing to Clinton and in many cases, losing them badly.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Can Trump make up the ground?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"History as we just showed you, says no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But then again, he's already defied history once.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"When we come back, an example of what Donald Trump is up against.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A Republican senator who's not ready to endorse him.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But he's also not ready to reject him outright either.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Welcome back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As we said earlier, divided parties lose elections.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It's a pretty simple proposition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me show you some history here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In '68, the Democrats were split.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They had their establishment vice president, Hubert Humphrey.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They had a peace-wing candidate led by Eugene McCarthy.,0,0,0,0,1,0
That riff played out on the streets of Chicago and helped Richard Nixon take the White House.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"'76, Gerald Ford was challenged on the right all the way to the convention by Ronald Reagan.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"A fight, arguably, some could say, to help put Jimmy Carter into the White House that fall.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"1980, it was Carter's turn.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A bitter challenge from the left by Senator Ted Kennedy certainly helped Reagan win 44 states and the presidency.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"1992, George H. W. Bush was the president, he had a populist primary challenger in the very conservative Pat Buchanan, an insurgency arguably that helped make Bush a one-term president.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Joining me now is a man who's emblematic of the current split in the Republican party.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He's Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, who right now says he's not ready to support Donald Trump, but he also hasn't ruled it out either.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Senator Flake, welcome back to the show, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hey, thanks for having me on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So you have said he's got to earn your support, you're looking for him to change his tone, change some of it, particularly the issue on the temporary ban on Muslims seems to be among the things that you find most difficult to support because it doesn't pass constitutional muster.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"If he doesn't retract that, can you ever support him?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I can't see that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He's got to soften his position there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, a total and complete ban on Muslims, that is a religious test that is certainly against the constitution.",0,0,0,1,1,0
And it is the last thing we should do if we want to win a war on terrorism.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So it's constitutionally wrong and also strategically, it's just not a smart thing to do.",0,0,0,1,0,0
So what should the party do though?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What do you want?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you want to see Mitt Romney run?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If Trump's not going to back away from these things, and you can't support him, what do you do?",0,0,0,0,0,0
How do you help your friend John McCain win his reelection in Arizona?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, obviously Donald Trump was not my first choice or my 17th choice to put it mildly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"However, he is the nominee, the presumptive nominee.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I don't see a third-party challenger come along.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would rather, as Paul Ryan has said, rather Mr. Trump simply change some of his positions and modify what he has said.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Now, I think he's going to need to, we are well behind in the polls right now, and in order to win this election, if Republicans want to win, and we do, then we've got to change the approach because we're not going to win taking these positions.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"You know, some Trump supporters would say modifying has been the problem with Republican nominees in the past.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Modifying, not saying what you believe, not speaking truth to power, or however you want to characterize what Trump is doing.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And they say, ""Hey, the voters have spoken, Senator, you need to get on board with him.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Why should he be obligated to get on board with where the Republican party is?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
Republican voters have spoken in a primary.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We've found in the past that that's a big difference from voters speaking in a general election.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We're now moving to a general election and it's a different ballgame completely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've found in the past, and we've done an autopsy every time we come out of one of these elections that we, for example, need a better position on immigration.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Simply saying we're going to deport 11 million people, that's not a position you can take in a general election.",0,0,1,1,1,1
It's not a rational approach.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So a general election is far different from a primary election.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Do you accept this idea though that if a significant chunk of party leadership, like yourself, Speaker Ryan, doesn't end up rallying around Trump, it probably is the death warrant for his candidacy in the fall.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Are you comfortable with that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think that that's death warrant for his candidacy.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"I think supporting a religious test for people to come here, saying you're going to change libel laws to make it easier to sue those who you don't agree with, saying that we're going to default on the debt, taking positions like that are what is going to impede your campaign, not the fact that some Republican leaders disagree with you.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Is there anything from Trump's success that in these primaries that made you think, ""You know what, maybe I ought to rethink my position on X""?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, like I said, it's one thing to win a primary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We all know that it's easier to win a primary taking certain positions, sometimes hard-core positions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we always know that those positions may not work in a general either.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So it's one thing to win a primary, it's a complete other ballgame to win a general election.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're out to win a general election as Republicans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't want another eight years or another four years of a Democrat in the White House.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so we've got to take a different position than we've taken in the primary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're one of the few Republicans that met with the president Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, you called him a ""man of accomplishment,"" and somebody with a quote, ""keen intellect.""",0,0,0,0,1,1
But you also believe that you want to wait for the election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You think the voters should have a say in this before dealing with the Supreme Court vacancy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now that Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee, have you changed your mind on that pledge?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think Republicans are more than justified in waiting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is following both principle and precedent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the principle is to have the most conservative, qualified jurists that we can have on the Supreme Court, not that the people ought to decide before the next election.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've never held that position.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"If we come to a point, I’ve said all along, where we're going to lose the election, or we lose the election in November, then we ought to approve him quickly.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Because I'm certain that he'll be more conservative than a Hillary Clinton nomination comes January.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jeff Flake, Republican senator from Arizona, I'm going to leave it there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thanks for getting up early out there and coming on this morning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I appreciate it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Glad to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Alrighty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We'll be back in a moment, but first Dana Carvey's church lady made a comeback last night on S.N.L.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(BEGIN TAPE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now we've landed on the exciting presidential match-up between a godless, liberal Democrat and Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(END TAPE),0,0,0,0,0,0
We are back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, how does the Republican Party put this all back together?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It’s just interesting hearing from Jeff Flake, um, Kellyanne.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Uh, I want to put up what Bill Bennett said.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Bill Bennett, you know, you have Jeff Flake, Paul Ryan, they’re in one place.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Bill Bennett said this: “It’s not the time to be out there demanding all of these things, trying to get Trump to suddenly become Reagan.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Now is the time to surround him with good people and work with him at the convention.”,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You said something interesting during the break, you said this is generational in the conservative movement.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Explain.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some of it is, you know how John McCain was saying he’ll vote for Donald Trump, I mean, he obviously has --",0,0,0,1,0,0
Bob Dole.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Bob Dole.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Newt Gingrich.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Bill Bennett, now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is somewhat generation for them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They recognize that it’s healthy for a party going through some growing pains to actually shed some of its skin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I also -- I also want to get back to Senator Flake’s interview, because I thought it was astonishing for this reason: Donald Trump just won 48 percent of the vote in the Republican primary -- every single delegate in Flake’s home state of Arizona, he got 250,000 voters, and you just can’t ignore that.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I mean his policies on immigration began in Jan Brewer’s Arizona.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And so I think there's a zeitgeist out there that some of the establishment of a Republican party are still ignoring.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And I would say, when I think of Senator Flake, I also, who I respect enormously, I think of this whole class of 2010 that is up for reelection in the Senate in 2016 this year.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They rode the Tea Party wave.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And now they've switched to decaf somehow.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"It's like your votes are so moderate, and if you look back--",0,0,0,0,0,1
They got into government.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They got into government.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And you go back a year ago, and look at their approval ratings and their reelect numbers a year ago.",0,0,0,0,1,1
They weren't doing so well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So laying it just at the feet of Donald Trump I think is naïve and inaccurate.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"But to your point about the generational divide, the idea that a bunch of senior figures are going to sit Donald Trump down in a room and coach him up, I mean, this is just insane.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"It's not going to happen, right?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And more to that point, Trump knows it's not going to happen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Trump is behaving as if this is his party now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's what they're up against.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when Paul Ryan was saying, you know, ""I want to hear a different tone,"" he does not want to hear what Donald Trump then went right out and did, which was to talk about Hillary Clinton, the philandering of Bill Clinton, how she was an enabler, he talked about murderers involved in Whitewater.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"In that very next speech, he was going in every direction that Paul Ryan does not want to hear.",0,0,0,1,0,0
He really wants to see whether Donald Trump can speak differently.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And he's not going to speak differently.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He can say one thing when he's on a teleprompter and another when he's out in front of a crowd, which is egging him on and reinforcing his basic instincts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Newt Gingrich, you can put Gingrich on the ticket, which is part of what's going on also, you know, put a running mate on who can help work with Congress.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is not going to change Donald Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as a Republican strategist here, I just have to say, Paul Ryan, who I have great affection, admiration for, he was on the ticket last time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Romney/Ryan ticket lost eight of the nine swing states, they lost his home state of Wisconsin by almost seven points--",0,0,1,1,1,1
I don't think you can blame the running mate for what happened at the top of the ticket.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well -- but it's fine, it's just that it's like, you had your chance last time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, they got 5 percent of the African American vote in Wisconsin.",0,0,0,0,1,1
They got beaten among Hispanics by two to one.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Is Trump going to do worse than that?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Kellyanne makes a really, well, meaning to I think makes a really-- it was an interesting point here, which is about, you know, for years, for cycles and cycles and cycles, the Republican establishment has basically said to the base of the Republican party, ""You lost--""",0,0,0,1,0,1
Fall in line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"--swallow it, get in line.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now they're being asked to get in line, and suddenly it's, ""But it's not your party.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
Wait a minute -- you inherited it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And Trump rightfully said, “Inherited it?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I won it.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
I won it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
won it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"did not inherit the party, I won it.",0,0,1,0,1,0
And he's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He beat them.,0,1,1,0,0,0
He beat them badly.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"Guys, look at where Hillary Clinton is going to be tomorrow.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"No that is her tomorrow, Monday afternoon.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Loudoun County, Virginia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That is where she is going to go for a Republican and swing voters for women, married women, older women, because she has not gotten the millennials, she knows she's got a big problem there.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But that is where she is trying to fight a general election strategy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Kelly, and I want to let you to have the last--",0,0,0,0,0,0
And the following day she’s going to lose in West Virginia and Oregon.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I want you to have the last word here on women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have spent a lot of time polling women for the Republican party, trying to help them with their problems with the gender gap.",0,0,0,0,1,0
How does Donald Trump fix this gender gap issue?,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has to go on the issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so, because so far, I think if Hillary Clinton runs a strict ideological and identity-politics campaign, she could lose.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And she also has a problem among men.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think part of what Donald Trump says on the stump is very machismo, because Hillary Clinton has the reverse gender gap.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"Men dislike her, don't trust her, and don't want her to be commander in chief--",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Who's the majority of the country, though.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course they are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And he will, I think he has to fight her on the issues.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because the one thing that's not going to change between now and November is who is the outsider and who is the insider.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And this does seem to be an outsider's election.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Boy, if he has to fight her on the issues, I don't know.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, where has she been for 30 years?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to do a quick 45-second pause and we’ll pick this back up here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Endgame is coming up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But first, we're going to continue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's Bill Clinton speaking to a class of 2016 as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a listen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(BEGIN TAPE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"The last two years has seen an amazing explosion of economic, social, and political empowerment.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Coming up, Meet the Press endgame, brought to you by Boeing, building the future one century at a time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
End Game time and I always feel bad when we have a great conversation and then the 45-second break and I’m like I want to recreate that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Quickly Bill Clinton you had an interesting reaction you guys just now to his commencement Matt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well you can see that these years have been difficult for him, he is struggling with his legacy of the 90’s.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That he is so proud of which has gotten pilloried now by both parties.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think that he is trying to to make the case, that that progress is real and that the rest of it isn't his fault.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that he's always haunted by that--,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But also, Bill Clinton's Democratic party is gone.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"They've purged their pro-lifers, they're pro-Second Amendment, there are no boll weevil Democrats, no Blue Dog Democrats who are the fiscally conservative.",0,0,1,1,1,0
Or the D.L.C.,0,0,0,0,0,0
that he helped create.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's disbanded.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And his own wife has left him on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's correct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She has now moved so far towards Bernie Sanders, and she can't move back again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But i thought it was --fascinating, you know, we could have done 20 minutes on what he meant by that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well yeah, yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He seems a little fearful of the change.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, he's fearful of the change, he doesn't like the fact that identity politics and microtargeting, and all of that--",0,0,0,1,0,0
Or that he’s being protested against--,0,0,0,1,0,0
--that's not Bill Clinton.,0,0,0,1,0,0
That's not his style.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, let's move to the media.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jim Rutenberg is the media writer at The New York Times, he wrote this: ""Every election cycle brings questionable news coverage, but this season has been truly spectacular in its failings.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It has been 'Dewey Defeats Truman' on a relentless, rolling basis.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The mistakes piled up, the bad predictions, the overplaying of every slight development of the horse race to the point of whiplash, the lighthearted treatment of what turned out to be the most serious candidacy in the Republican field.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"The lessons learned did not.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm sort of amused by this coming from The New York Times.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Eugene, not to pile on one newspaper, but if you were to compare, say, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, the two big behemoths, The Post took Trump more seriously--",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Uh, yeah,more seriously.",0,0,0,0,0,0
--quicker than The Times did.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Right, right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The key to covering this campaign was to cover the campaign as it was, not as you thought it should be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Or wished it was.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Or wished it was, or whatever.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And so observer bias crept into a lot of coverage and people took more seriously the data points that confirmed their view than the data points that refuted their view.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And so while Donald Trump was winning, he was way ahead in the polls, and so people would write that well, 56 percent of Republicans voted for somebody other than Donald Trump.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Well, yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, 85 percent voted for somebody other than Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio or whatever, so.",0,0,0,1,1,1
But i don’t think--I don't think you can escape the fact that he got enormous amounts of free media and that it was all focused on live carrying of his rallies and reporting every tweet.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And there was less policy discussion, less policy coverage, not just about Donald Trump but all of the candidates.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"It was more horserace, more poll driven, more social-media driven than in any previous campaign--",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But by the way, the candidates was more poll driven.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Don’t forget the candidates--I know,0,0,0,0,0,0
But that doesn't mean that you define it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I understand that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But here was another thing I'm wondering, if you're Ted Cruz, or if you're any candidate in the future, message discipline is a negative.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's actually a negative.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It has been for awhile.,0,0,0,0,0,0

And now I have a question about your emails.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Your Republican opponents say that those emails have endangered our national security.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"When you were secretary of state, you wrote 104 emails in your private server that the government now says contain classified information according to The Washington Post analysis.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"That goes against a memo that you personally sent to your employees in 2011 directing all of them to use official email, precisely because of security concerns.",0,0,0,1,1,0
So it seems that you issued one set of rules for yourself and a different set of rules for the rest of the State Department.,0,0,0,1,0,0
So who specifically gave you permission to operate your email system as you did?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Was it President Barack Obama?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And would you drop out of the race if you get indicted?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Jorge, there's a lot of questions in there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm going to give the same answer I've been giving for many months.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It wasn't the best choice.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I made a mistake.,0,0,0,1,0,0
It was not prohibited.,0,0,1,0,1,0
It was not in any way disallowed.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And as I have said and as now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing and many other people in the government.",1,0,0,0,1,1
But here's the cut to the chase facts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I did not send or receive any emails marked classified at the time.,0,0,0,0,1,1
What you are talking about is retroactive classification.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the reason that happens is when somebody asks or when you are asked to make information public, I asked all my emails to be made public.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Then all the rest of the government gets to weigh in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And some other parts of the government, we're not exactly sure who, has concluded that some of the emails should be now retroactively classified.",0,0,0,1,1,1
They've just said the same thing to former Secretary Colin Powell.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They have said, we're going to retroactively classify emails you sent personally.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Now I think he was right when he said this is an absurdity.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And I think that what we have got here is a case of overclassification.,0,0,0,1,0,0
If we get your permission...,0,0,0,0,0,0

It had been done by my predecessors.,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you get indicted would you going to drop out?,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm not going to engage in the kind of language that he uses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think we can make the case against him if he is the nominee, by pointing out what he has said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What he claims to believe in The values he's promoting and I think that's a better way for the American people to draw their conclusions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, do you think it's fair to call Donald Trump a racist?",0,0,0,1,0,0
This is what I think.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that the American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African-Americans.",0,0,0,1,0,0

That's a difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me — let me respond again because the misrepresentation can't go unanswered here.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"First of all, that is something that is not fair about what I said.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I did say we needed to be very concerned about little children coming to this country — on their own, very often — many of them not making it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when they got here, they needed, as I have argued for, legal counsel, due process, to make a decision.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need to end private detention, we need to end family detention.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And in 2006, when Senator Sanders was running for the Senate from Vermont, he voted in the House with hard-line Republicans for indefinite detention for undocumented immigrants, and then he sided with those Republicans to stand with vigilantes known as Minute Men who were taking up outposts along the border to hunt down immigrants.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"So I think when you were running for the Senate, you made it clear by your vote, Senator, that you were going to stand with the Republicans.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you got to the Senate in 2007, one of the first things you did was vote against Ted Kennedy's immigration reform which he'd been working on for years before you ever arrived.",0,0,0,0,1,1

"And you told me, no, that you wouldn't be the next deporter in chief.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"However, you refused two times to say you would not deport children.",0,0,0,1,1,1
This is what you said.,0,0,0,0,1,0

And can you promise that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record?,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Here's what I can promise Jorge, I can promise that I will do everything possible to provide due process.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But will you deport children?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would give every person, but particularly children, due process to have their story told.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And a lot of children will, of course, have very legitimate stories under our law to be able to stay.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"So secretary, you seem to be defending President Obama's deportation policy.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"And as you know, so far he has deported more than 2.5 million immigrants.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"So if you really don't want to be the next deporter in chief, can you promise tonight that you won't deport children and that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record and this time, could I get a yes or no answer?",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Yes, you can because the question you were asking me were about children seeking asylum.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was the most critical thing I said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Under our laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would like to see those laws changed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would like see added to them, a guaranteed counsel and other support for children.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if you are asking about everyone who is already here, undocumented immigrants, the 11-12 million who are living here, my priorities are to deport violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety.",0,0,0,0,1,1
So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"But again, yes or no, can you promise tonight that you won't deport children, children who are already here?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will not deport children.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I would not deport children.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us.",0,0,0,1,0,0
That's a relatively small universe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I want to be very specific.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So you are telling us tonight that if you become president you won't deport children who are already here?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will not.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And that you won't deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what I'm telling you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now I don't want — because I'm not contradicting what I told you in the interview.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Asylum is a particular legal process.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I'd like to see it changed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to see us give more support to people who come fleeing the terrible violence that they do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But under our law, we have a process we have to go through which is different.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So you will stop those deportations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would stop...,0,0,0,0,0,0
The deportations for children...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
... and those who don't have a criminal record.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of the people, the undocumented people living in our country, I do not want to see them deported.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I want to see them on a path to citizenship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is exactly what I will do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, would you — can you promise us tonight that you won't deport children?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't think that the secretary fully answered your question, and I think the proof may be in the pudding.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Honduras and that region of the world may be the most violent region in our hemisphere.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Gang lords, vicious people torturing people, doing horrible things to families.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"Children fled that part of the world to try, try, try, try, maybe, to meet up with their family members in this country, taking a route that was horrific, trying to start a new life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton did not support those children coming into this country.,0,0,0,1,1,0
I did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now I happen to agree with President Obama on many, many issues.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think he has done a great job as president of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He is wrong on this issue of deportation.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I disagree with him on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"So to answer your question, no, I will not deport children from the United States of America.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And can you promise not to deport immigrants who don't have a criminal record?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can make that promise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is why I go back to that 2007 vote because if we had been successful then, a lot of the issues we are still discussing today would be in the rear-view mirror.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want us to be able to achieve comprehensive immigration reform if I'm so fortunate enough to be president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we do have to take a look at asylum laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I was secretary of state, I worked to try to support many different approaches to ending the violence in Central America.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"I was there meeting with leaders, security leaders, and others.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Let me just answer, I want to get back to this 2007 immigration bill.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's true, Ted Kennedy, a good friend of mine, and I think of the secretary's, did work very hard on that bill.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But does anyone really believe that if that bill was all so good, as the secretary is touting, that LULAC and other major Latino organizations, the largest Latino organizations in this country said no to that bill.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And I worked very hard in improving the guest worker provisions so that in 2013 a bill I strongly supported, people who were in the guest worker program in America would not be treated like slaves.",0,0,0,0,1,1

Let me just conclude by saying that United Farm Workers considered that bill in their words the last best hope for farm workers and immigrants.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They have proven to be right in the succeeding years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I only hope that we can put together a coalition to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next Congress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as I said earlier, in 2006, Senator Sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation...",0,0,1,1,1,1
It's...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"...and stood with the Minutemen vigilantes in their ridiculous, absurd efforts to, quote, ""hunt down immigrants.",0,0,0,1,1,0

"Did you support the Minutemen, Senator?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Did you support the Minutemen?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm sorry?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Did you support the Minutemen, as Secretary Clinton has said?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There was a piece of legislation supported by dozens and dozens of members of the House which codified existing legislation.,0,0,0,0,1,1
What the secretary is doing tonight and has done very often is take large pieces of legislation and take pieces out of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I did not oppose the bailout or the support of the automobile industry.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make.",0,0,0,1,0,0

Let's talk about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's talk about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary, you said this morning...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's talk about the auto bailout because I think it's important for people to understand what happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In December of 2008, we were both in the Senate, there was a vote on a free-standing bill to rescue the auto industry.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We both voted for it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
was the right vote.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unfortunately, it did not succeed.",0,0,0,1,1,0
The Republicans marshalled the votes against it.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"A month later, in January, a new piece of legislation was offered that contained the money that would be used for the auto rescue.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Then President-elect Obama — before he'd even been sworn in — sent word to all of us that he really hoped we would support it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"He was still in the Senate, I was still in the Senate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I voted for it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
It was a hard vote.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'll tell you, it was a hard vote.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot of the votes you make are hard votes.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But the fact is the money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Secretary...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, Senator Sanders voted against it.",0,0,0,1,1,0
That's his perfect right to vote against it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But if everyone had voted as he voted...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, let me...",0,0,0,0,0,0
... we would not have rescued the auto industry.,0,0,1,0,0,1
You have 30 seconds and then we'll pass to another.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Thirty more seconds and then we'll move to another...,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me — let's — so that everybody knows, the bill that Secretary Clinton is talking about, that is — that was the bailout of the recklessness, irresponsibility and illegal behavior of Wall Street.",0,0,0,1,1,0
It was the Wall Street bailout.,0,0,0,0,1,1

"And I find it interesting that when Secretary Clinton, who was the former senator of New York, of course, when she defended her vote, she said, well, it's going to help the big banks in New York.",0,0,0,0,1,1

Next question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you recently said instead of building walls we need to tear down barriers.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"However, last November in New Hampshire, you openly said that as senator you voted numerous times to build the wall with Mexico.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"What's the difference between what you did, voting to build the wall, and what Donald Trump wants to do now?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think both of us, both Senator Sanders and I, voted numerous times to enhance border security along our border.",0,0,0,0,1,0
We increased the number of border security agents.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"We did vote for money to build a fence, a pedestrian fence in some place, a vehicle fence in other places.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And the result is that we have the most secure border we've ever had.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Apprehensions coming across the border are the lowest they've been in 40 years, which just strengthens my argument that now it's time to do comprehensive immigration reform.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"The Republicans, the opponents no longer have an argument.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And certainly, we hear a lot coming from the Republican side that is absolutely out of touch with reality.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We raised money through the congressional appropriations process.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We enhanced the border security.,0,0,0,0,1,0
That part of the work is done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Everybody that I know has looked at it said, okay, we have a secure border.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There's no need for this rhetoric and demagoguery that's still —is carried out on the Republican side.,0,0,0,1,0,0
You've run out of excuses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's move to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that makes a very strong argument in favor of doing it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the question is, what is the difference between the wall that you voted for and Donald Trump's wall?",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a big difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, as I understand him, he's talking about a very tall wall.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ laughter ],0,0,0,0,0,0
Right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
A beautiful tall wall.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The most beautiful tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China, that would run the entire border.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That he would somehow magically get the Mexican government to pay for.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And, you know, it's just fantasy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in fact, if he cared to know anything about what members of Congress, like the senator and I have done, where it was necessary, we did support some fencing.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Where it was necessary, we did add border patrol agents.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"We have done what by any fair estimate would have to conclude is a good job, quote, ""securing the border"".",0,0,0,0,0,0
So let's get about the business of comprehensive immigration reform.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just say...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think the secretary and I mostly, I think, agree on this issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, in this country, immigration reform is a very hot debate.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's divided the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I would hope very much, that as we have that debate, we do not, as Donald Trump and others have done, resort to racism and xenophobia and bigotry.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"This idea of suddenly, one day or maybe a night, rounding up 11 million people and taking them outside of this country is a vulgar, absurd idea that I would hope very few people in America support.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Your time is up, senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now we have a question from the audience for both of you.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We have a question from the public.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to go to Lucia Aquiette.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She's an immigrant from Guatemala, she's here with her five children who have not seen their father since he was deported three years ago.",0,0,0,0,0,1

I would like to ask — me and my children — hardworking men in the field —,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Senator Sanders, as you can see, these are a very painful and personal issue for Lucia and her family.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"She wants to know what you would do to stop deportations, but most importantly, to reunite families like hers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I absolutely support that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
At the heart of my immigration policy and I should say that the New York times editorial board called my immigration policy the most progressive and the strongest of any candidate running.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"But to answer your question, the essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
The idea that a mother is living here and her children are on the other side of the border is wrong and immoral.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A number of months ago, I talked to a young man who was serving in the United States military and while he was serving in the military, his wife was deported.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That is beyond comprehension and policies that should not be allowed to exist.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So, ma'am, I will do everything that I can to unite your family.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Your children deserve to be with their mother.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"First of all, please know how brave I think you are, coming here with your children to tell your story.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is an incredible act of courage that I'm not sure many people really understand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I want you to know that in the work that I've done and the many families that I've met, I have heard similar stories like yours, where your husband is deported.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Your children's father is gone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You are doing your very best to support your children.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it is time to bring families together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I don't think there's any doubt that we must do more to let stories like yours be heard more widely so that more Americans know what the human cost of these policies are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will do everything I can to prevent other families from facing what you are facing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will do everything I can to pass laws that would bring families back together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I hope that your children are all either citizens born in this country or eligible for the programs that President Obama has put into place, DACA and DAPA, because I will defend those and I will absolutely protect your children, yourself, and try to bring your family back together.",0,0,0,0,0,1

But Americans have also had 25 — more than that — years to get to know you for themselves.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Is there anything in your own actions and the decisions that you yourself have made that would foster this kind of mistrust?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, what I have said is that when you get I believe it is $225,000 for giving a speech, and she gave several speeches to Goldman Sachs, one of the Wall Street financial institutions whose greed and illegal behavior helped destroy our economy a number of years ago, when you get paid $225,000, that means that that speech must have been an extraordinarily wonderful speech.",0,0,1,1,1,1

"And right now, I go around asking people at my events if they know what their interest rate is and the interest rates literally go from like 8 percent to 14 percent.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"It's outrageous that at a time when interest rates have been historically low, people borrowing money to invest in their education are paying some of the highest interest rates around.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And you can refinance your house to get a lower interest rate.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You can refinance your car.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Corporations can refinance their debt.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"But for people who have it, I'm going to put a date certain that after a certain number of years, you no longer have to pay anything.",0,0,0,0,0,1

I think what Secretary Clinton just said is absolutely right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think I said it many months before she said it, but thanks for copying a very good idea.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"One of the things we should not be doing obviously, is punishing people for doing what we want them to do and that is to get an education.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
But here is the point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My program, making public colleges and universities tuition free, allowing people with debt to refinance at the lowest possible interest rates is a fairly expensive proposal, about $70 billion a year.",0,0,0,1,1,1

I'm going to pay for it by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.,0,0,0,1,0,0

Now that will no longer happen because we have Dodd-Frank and we will break up banks that pose a systemic threat to our economy.,0,0,0,1,1,1

But let me say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders has talked about free college for everybody.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"He's talked about universal, single payer health care for everybody.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"And yet, when you ask questions, as many of us have and more importantly, independent experts, it's very hard to get answers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And a lot of the answers say that this is going to be much more expensive than anything Senator Sanders is admitting to.,0,0,0,1,0,1
This is going to increase the federal government dramatically.,0,0,1,0,0,1

What Secretary Clinton is saying is that the United States should continue to be the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all of our people.,0,0,0,0,1,1

"I think if the rest of the world can do it, we can.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I will build on the Affordable Care Act.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will take it further.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will reduce the cost.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I just respectfully disagree.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Between the Republicans trying to repeal the first chance we've ever had to get to universal health care, and Senator Sanders wanting to throw us into a contentious debate over single-payer, I think the smart approach is build on and protect the Affordable Care Act.",0,0,0,0,0,1

I'm going to call time here because I want to move on to a subject that more than two dozen Florida mayors have asked to raise with you.,0,0,0,0,0,0

You can see that no state has more at stake than Florida does.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And no city has more at stake than Miami, the city in which we are sitting.",0,0,1,0,0,1
But many Republicans argue that this is not a man-made problem.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Senator Sanders, is it possible to move forward on this issue if you do not get a bipartisan consensus, and what would you do?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, Karen, when you have Republican candidates for president and in Congress telling you that climate change is a hoax, which is Donald Trump and other candidates' position, what they are really saying is, we don't have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry.",0,0,0,1,0,1

"On that day, that Republican loses his campaign funding from the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry.",0,0,1,1,1,1

I had a chance to talk to some of them about this issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is a really serious one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there isn't much time left to do several things that I will move quickly to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You can see already what's happening in Miami, particularly in Miami Beach with tides rising.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So we do have to invest in resilience and mitigation while we are trying to cut emissions and make up for the fact that this is clearly man-made and man-aggravated.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And there are certain things that the president has done through executive action that I will absolutely support.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All the Republican say they will, if they're elected, heaven forbid, repeal all of those executive actions.",0,0,1,1,1,0
I will maintain them and act on them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The clean power plan is something that Senator Sanders has said he would delay implementing, which makes absolutely no sense.",1,0,0,1,1,1
We need to implement all of the president's executive actions and quickly move to make a bridge from coal to natural gas to clean energy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is the way we will keep the lights on while we are transitioning to a clean energy future.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I strongly support a piece of legislation from Senator Tammy Baldwin that would do just that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will be looking for people who will put the interests of consumers first, who will do more to try to make sure Main Street flourishes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will very much reach out and ask for advice as to who should be appointed, including to Senator Warren and many of my other former colleagues in the Senate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think it's important also to look at what we want to accomplish.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, in the debates we've had — maybe this is the seventh or so — Senator Sanders is always criticizing the two recent Democratic presidents — President Clinton and President Obama.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And that's fine, but I wish he would criticize and join me in criticizing George W. Bush, who I think wrecked the economy and created the conditions for the great recession.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You know, at the end of the '90s, we had 23 million new jobs.",0,1,1,0,1,1

Median family income went up 17 percent.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"For minorities, it went up even more.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Along came the Republicans, trickle-down economics — one of the worst ideas since snake oil — was put back into place.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And we ended up with the great recession.,0,0,0,0,0,0
President Obama had to rescue the economy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for doing that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, your name was mentioned.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Now, let me say this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I gather Secretary Clinton hasn't listened to too many of my speeches.,0,0,0,1,0,0

Or followed my work in the Congress as very few people stood up to George W. Bush whether it was the war in Iraq or any other of his policies.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Now, when we talk about the policies of the 1990s, I worked closely and supported President Clinton.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"And obviously, I have worked very closely in supporting President Obama, who has taken our economy a very long way from where Bush left us.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"But when you go back to the 1990s, let's remember, that's when Wall Street deregulation took place.",0,0,0,0,1,1

President Barack Obama is going to Cuba in two weeks.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"I helped to implement some of them leading up to the announcements when I was secretary of state, expanding travel opportunities, remittances.",0,0,0,0,1,0
And I certainly told the president toward the end of my time that I hoped he would be able to move toward diplomatic relations and to make more of an impact by building up the relationship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And there are no better ambassadors for freedom, democracy and economic opportunity than Cuban Americans.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So the more that we can have that kind of movement back and forth, the more likely we are to be able to move Cuba toward greater freedom, greater respect for rights.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I'm looking forward to following the president's trip.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do think meeting with dissidents, meeting with people who have been voices, tribunes of freedom and opportunity is important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Cuban people deserve to have their human rights respected and upheld, they deserve to be able to move towards democracy where they pick their own leads.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I think both Castros have to be considered authoritarian and dictatorial because they are not freely chosen by the people that are in Cuba.,0,0,0,1,0,1

"I hope someday there will be leaders who are chosen by the Cuban people, and I hope that democracy will be deeply rooted in Cuban soil and that the people of Cuba will have every opportunity to fulfill their own dreams in their own country.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"On Facebook, by the way, this is the conversation that everybody is having, talking about Cuba.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Look, I understand that not everybody in Florida or in the United States will agree with me, but I think we have got to end the embargo.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I believe that we should move towards full and normalized political relations with Cuba.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think at the end of the day, it will be a good thing for the Cuban people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It will enable them, I think when they see people coming into their country from the United States, move in a more democratic direction, which is what I want to see.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"In 1985, you praised the Sandinista government and you said that Daniel Ortega was an impressive guy.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"You may recall way back in, when was it, 1961, they invaded Cuba, and everybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the world.",0,0,0,1,1,1

"So please explain what is the difference between the socialism that you profess and the socialism in Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, let me just answer that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What that was about was saying that the United States was wrong to try to invade Cuba, that the United States was wrong trying to support people to overthrow the Nicaraguan government, that the United States was wrong trying to overthrow in 1954, the government — democratically elected government of Guatemala.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Throughout the history of our relationship with Latin America we've operated under the so-called Monroe Doctrine, and that said the United States had the right do anything that they wanted to do in Latin America.",0,0,0,0,1,1
So I actually went to Nicaragua and I very shortly opposed the Reagan administration's efforts to overthrow that government.,0,0,0,1,1,1
And I strongly opposed earlier Henry Kissinger and the — to overthrow the government of Salvador Aliende in Chile.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"I think the United States should be working with governments around the world, not get involved in regime change.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And all of these actions, by the way, in Latin America, brought forth a lot of very strong anti-American sentiments.",0,0,0,1,1,0
That's what that was about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, in retrospect, have you ever regretted the characterizations that you made of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that way?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm sorry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please say that...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In retrospect, have you ever regretted the characterizations of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that you made in 1985?",0,0,0,0,0,0
The key issue here was whether the United States should go around overthrowing small Latin American countries.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I think that that was a mistake...,0,0,0,1,0,0
You didn't answer the question.,0,0,0,0,0,0

They have made some progress in education.,0,0,0,0,1,0

"The first 100 days, secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Absolutely, although it happens before I am president if I am so fortunate to be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have been calling for months that the Congress must give authority to Puerto Rico to restructure its debts.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"We see schools being closed, we see health care being denied and we see a thousand Puerto Rican families a month moving to the United States, mostly to Florida.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Puerto Ricans are citizen of America.,0,0,0,0,0,1

And I just want to add one thing to the question you were asking Senator Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think in that same interview, he praised what he called the revolution of values in Cuba and talked about how people were working for the common good, not for themselves.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I just couldn't disagree more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, if the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere.",0,0,1,1,0,0

"Well, as I said earlier, I don't believe it is the business of the United States government to be overthrowing small countries around the world.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And number two, when you get to Puerto Rico, there's an issue that we have not talked about.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That little island is $73 billion in debt and the government now is paying interest rates of up to 11 percent.,0,0,1,1,1,1
And many of the bonds that they are paying off were purchased by vulture capitalists for 30 cents on the dollar.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"And what I have said in talking to the leaders of Puerto Rico, we've got to bring people together.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it's not the people of Puerto Rico, or the children or the schools.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, OK",0,0,0,0,0,0
But maybe some of these vulture capitalists who are going to have to lose a little bit of money in this process.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We need to move on to another topic.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And so from my perspective, it is imperative that we put enormous pressure on the Republicans in the Senate to do their constitutional duty.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, obviously you look for people who are not only qualified on paper, but have a heart, have life experience, understand what these decisions mean in the lives of Americans.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And understand the balance of power that their decisions can disrupt one way or the other.,0,0,0,0,0,0

So we got a lot of questions from the audience for you on a lot of policy issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I got to start off with some news of the day topics.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski charged with simple battery for grabbing a reporter by the arm.",0,0,1,0,1,0
Will he continue as your campaign manager?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, he will.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I looked at the tape.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I looked — it was my tape.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It was at one of my places.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have great security and great security cameras.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I gave the tape, and frankly, if you look at that, people have looked at it — in fact, I just left another area of Wisconsin, we had a whole big meeting with a whole group of people, big audience, tremendous audience, and they’re all shaking their heads, give me a break, give me a break.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Let me ask you, though…",0,0,0,0,0,0
The answer is yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, speaking of something else, I watched Ted Cruz.",0,0,0,0,0,0
His home state is not Florida.,0,0,0,0,0,1
His home state is Texas.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It may be Canada.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But to the best of my knowledge, it’s Texas.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So he made that — I was surprised you didn’t correct him actually.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Let me ask you about Lewandowski.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Initially your campaign said this never happened, there was no video of it.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"You came out and said you thought this person was, perhaps, making it up, this reporter.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Lewandowski, himself, tweeted saying, I never met this reporter, I never touched this person; now the videotape shows he clearly did touch this person.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Whether or not you think it was battery or not…,0,0,0,1,0,0
Touch — I don’t know what touch means.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Did he mislead you at all?,0,0,0,1,0,0
Not at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, not at all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I didn’t know we had all these security cameras all over.",0,0,0,1,0,0

(inaudible) would have happened (inaudible) went to the ground or something to the effect that she almost went to the ground.,0,0,0,1,0,0
She was in pain.,0,0,1,0,0,0
She went to the ground.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"When she found out that there was a security camera, and that they had her on tape, all of a sudden that story changed.",1,0,1,0,0,0
She didn’t talk about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0

She says her story has remained exactly the same.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She was knocked a little bit off…,0,0,0,0,0,0

Can I read this to you this then?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I stick up for people, and I don’t want to ruin somebody’s life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It would have been very easy for me to do so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, when I owned Miss Universe, I had the case of the young woman who was very unjustly accused by somebody that you know very well.",0,0,0,1,0,0

And I’m very proud of her.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She had a tremendous substance abuse problem and I’m very – Tara, I’m very, very proud of her.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m very proud of the job she did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to ask you about another tweet you sent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You sent a tweet over the weekend about the death toll in this horrible terror attack in Pakistan over the weekend.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You talked about the death toll.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And then you said, I alone can solve.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What do you mean by that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think I alone because I know my competition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I know my competition.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You, alone, among the Republican candidates.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"I see Hillary with Benghazi, you know the famous ad, 3:00 in the morning, guess what, the phone rang, she wasn’t there.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Unless Sidney called, if Sidney called she was there.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But you’re the only one who can solve terror problems in Pakistan?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, Pakistan…",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, of the ones that are running, I’m the only one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know what I’m running.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know the competition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And believe me, I know, I watched Ted Cruz.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How though?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, what…",0,0,0,0,0,0
So phony.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, you know, I know you have couple people out there because he put them in the audience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it’s so false.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You know, the whole thing with the five-second intermissions between sentences.",0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I think I am the one to be able to solve the problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, I mean, there’s problems in a lot of different countries, problems in the United States.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"How can you solve the problems all the way over in Pakistan when the Pakistanis, themselves, are struggling with it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, look, Pakistan is a very, very vital problem and really vital country for us because they have a thing called nuclear weapons.",0,0,1,1,1,1
They have to get a hold of their situation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I see that and when I see it put in a park because it was mostly Christians, although many others were killed other than Christians, I think it’s just absolutely a horrible story.",0,0,1,1,1,1
But I’m talking about radical Islamic terrorism.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I will solve it far better than anybody else running.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let’s talk about nuclear issues because you talked about this in a really interesting article in The New York Times.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"One of the very, very big issues.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think maybe the biggest issue of our time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s what you said to The New York Times.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You said you worried about the proliferation of nuclear weapons…,0,0,0,1,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
… the most.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You also said, though, that you might support Japan and South Korea developing nuclear weapons of their own.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Isn’t that completely contradictory?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"No, not at all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, you have North Korea has nuclear weapons.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And he doesn’t have a carrier yet but he has got nuclear weapons.,0,0,1,1,1,1
He soon will have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don’t want to pull the trigger.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’re just — you know, we have a president, frankly, that doesn’t — nobody is afraid of our president.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Nobody respects our president.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You take a look at what’s going on throughout the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s not the country that it was.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if you’re concerned about proliferation, letting other countries get nuclear weapons, isn’t that proliferation?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"No, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We owe $19 $trillion, we have another $2 trillion because of the very, very bad omnibus budget that was just signed.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"It’s a disgrace, which gives everything that Obama wanted.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We get nothing.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They get everything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So that’s going to be $21 trillion.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"We are supporting nations now, militarily, we are supporting nations like Saudi Arabia which was making during the good oil days which was a year ago, now they’re making less but still a lot, $1 billion a day.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"We are supporting them, militarily, and pay us a fraction, a fraction of what they should be paying us and of the cost.",0,0,0,0,1,0
We are supporting Japan.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Most people didn’t even know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Most people didn’t know that we are taking care of Japan’s military needs.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We’re supporting…,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Excuse me, excuse me, we’re supporting Germany.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re supporting South Korea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I order thousands of television sets because I am in the real estate business, you know, in my other life, OK.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It has been a U.S. policy for decades to prevent Japan from getting a nuclear weapon.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"That might be policy, but maybe…",0,0,0,0,0,0
South Korea as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can I be honest are you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Maybe it’s going to have to be time to change, because so many people, you have Pakistan has it, you have China has it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have so many other countries are now having it…,0,0,0,0,1,0
So some proliferation is OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, not proliferation.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I hate nuclear more than any.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My uncle was a professor was at MIT, used to (AUDIO GAP) nuclear, he used to tell me about the problem.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But that’s contradictory about Japan and South Korea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(AUDIO GAP) Iran is going to have it very — within…,0,0,0,0,0,0
But that’s proliferation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Excuse me, one of the dumbest I’ve ever seen signed ever, ever, ever by anybody, Iran is going to have it within 10 years.",0,0,1,1,1,0
Iran is going to have it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I thought it was a very good interview in The New York Times.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So you have no problem with Japan and South Korea having…,0,0,0,0,0,0
I thought…,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
… nuclear weapons.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"At some point we have to say, you know what, we’re better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea, we’re better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself, we have…",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Saudi Arabia, absolutely.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Here’s the thing, with Japan, they have to pay us or we have to let them protect themselves.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So if you said, Japan, yes, it’s fine, you get nuclear weapons, South Korea, you as well, and Saudi Arabia says we want them, too?",0,0,1,1,0,1
Can I be honest with you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It’s going to happen, anyway.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s going to happen anyway.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s only a question of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re going to start having them or we have to get rid of them entirely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you have so many countries already, China, Pakistan, you have so many countries, Russia, you have so many countries right now that have them.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, wouldn’t you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?",0,0,0,1,0,0
And they do have them.,0,0,0,0,1,0
They absolutely have them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They can’t — they have no carrier system yet but they will very soon.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Wouldn’t you rather have Japan, perhaps, they’re over there, they’re very close, they’re very fearful of North Korea, and we’re supposed to protect.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So you’re saying you don’t want more nuclear weapons in the world but you’re OK with Japan and South Korea having nuclear weapons?,0,0,0,1,0,1
I don’t want more nuclear weapons.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"I think that — you know, when I hear Obama get up and say the biggest threat to the world today is global warming, I say, is this guy kidding?",1,0,0,0,0,0
The only global warming — the only global warming I’m worried about is nuclear global warming because that’s the single biggest threat.,0,0,0,1,0,1
So it’s not that I’m a fan — we can’t afford it anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re sitting on a tremendous bubble.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’re going to be — again, $21 trillion.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We don’t have money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So you have no security concerns…,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re using all of the money…,0,0,0,0,1,0
… about Japan or South Korea getting nuclear weapons?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Anderson, when you see all of the money that our country is spending on military, we’re not spending it for ourselves; we’re protecting all of these nations all over the world.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We can’t afford to do it anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But isn’t there benefit for the United States in having a secure Europe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Isn’t there benefit for the United States in having a secure Asia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There’s a benefit, but not big enough to bankrupt and destroy the United States, because that’s what’s happening.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We can’t afford it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s very simple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I would rather see Japan having some form of defense, and maybe even offense, against North Korea.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because we’re not pulling the trigger.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The bottom line on North Korea is china, if they wanted to, they’re a tremendous supplier of North Korea.",0,0,0,0,1,1
They have tremendous power over North Korea.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"If they wanted to, if they weren’t toying with us, Anderson, China would be the one that would get in and could make a deal in one day, okay…",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to bring into the audience just a moment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just a last question before we do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve got to ask you about this back and forth between you and Senator Cruz about wives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"After saying that you were going to spill the beans about Heidi Cruz, you retweeted an unflattering picture of her next to a picture of your wife.",0,0,1,1,0,0
I thought it was a nice picture of Heidi.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I thought it was fine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Come on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I thought it was fine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She’s a pretty woman.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You’re running for president of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Excuse me, I didn’t start it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn’t start it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, sir, with all due respect, that’s the argument of 5-year-old.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, it’s not.",0,0,1,0,0,0
The argument of a 5-year-old is he started it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You would say that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s the problem with our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Every parent knows a kid who says he started it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s not a 5-year-old.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Exactly that thinking is the problem this country has.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I did not start this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He sent out a picture and he knew very well it was a picture…,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
He didn’t send out a picture.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It was an anti-Trump super PAC sent out.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"Anderson, it was a cover story of a picture taken by Antoine Verglas, one of the great photographers of the world, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"It was a picture for the cover of “GQ,” which is a decent — which is a very good magazine.",0,0,0,0,0,1

It wasn’t even a pro-Cruz super PAC; it was an anti-Trump super PAC.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"Excuse me, they were Romney people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Romney is, you know, very embarrassed that he did so badly four years ago.",0,0,0,1,0,0
The guy choked like a dog and lost an election…,0,0,1,1,0,0
Do you have proof that he sent it out?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, everybody knows he sent it out.",0,0,1,0,1,0
He knew the people in the super PAC.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He knew — I would be willing to bet he wrote the phrase.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, this is — would you like to have this as your first lady?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And a lot of people said, yes, actually, if you want to know the truth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
But she was a magnificent model.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She took a picture with one of the great photographers of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They put it on “GQ.”  All of a sudden we see this picture going all over Utah just before the election.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And by the way, when he said, “We had a big day, we won Utah.”  Excuse me, I won Arizona with far more delegates, and as you probably saw, 25 minutes ago, so maybe you didn’t see it, the vote was just counted in Missouri and I won Missouri, too.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Congratulations.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Your wife is lovely, she’s very intelligent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Heidi Cruz, I haven’t interviewed her — she seems like a very intelligent, very accomplished person as well.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Can you just leave wives out of this?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’d like to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But why retweet — why retweet somebody?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would love to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I really would rather talk about nuclear proliferation.,0,0,0,1,0,0
It’s a slightly more important subject.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You act as if retweeting is not an endorsement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me just tell you something, I would love to do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn’t send the photo to everybody in the state of Utah.,0,0,1,0,1,1
He did.,0,0,0,0,1,0
He knew about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was his people, who were his friends.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It was a PAC that’s…,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Couldn’t you just let it go, though?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you have to retweet some random person sending you…,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I don’t let things go so easy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And let me tell you something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don’t let the — if I were running the country, I wouldn’t have people taking advantage of the United States in trade and in every other way, either.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Believe me, I wouldn’t have China walking away with trade deficits of $505 billion a year.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"I wouldn’t have Mexico laughing at us how stupid we are with trade deals, and at the border.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I wouldn’t let Japan get away what they’re doing with, you know, devaluation of the yen.",0,0,0,1,0,0
China big league devaluation.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"No, I — when somebody…",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Can you say tonight, though, no more such about wives?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, absolutely.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t want to talk about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s ridiculous to be talking about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, let’s go to the audience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want you to meet retired Lieutenant Brian Murphy.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"His fellow officer standing next to him, Sam Lenda, took out the shooter that day, is also with us.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We wanted to just first of all take a moment to thank both of them for their service and their actions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Brian has a question for you tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He says he’s — he likes Governor Kasich but he’s still undecided — so Brian.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Good evening, Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In light of the Brussels and Paris attacks one of the quickest knee-jerk reactions is a backlash against specific minority religious groups.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"This, in turn, brings about things that cause damage all over.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"In Milwaukee, you heard about the Sikh temple shooting.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Six people were killed.,0,0,1,0,1,1
99 percent of the men in the United States who wear turbans are actually Sikh and not Muslim.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"How would you suggest we help educate the public and not alienate these groups and, at the same time, how do we protect the constitutional rights of minority groups like the Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, and Jews, while still addressing radical Islamization?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, Brian, thank you for the question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a tremendous problem with radical Islam whether we like it or we don’t.,0,0,0,1,1,0
We have a president who won’t talk about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, Ted was saying the same thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a president who won’t talk about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why he won’t talk about, perhaps only he knows, but it’s a disgrace what’s going on.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We have a serious, serious problem, and when I called for a temporary ban I thought that was a very bad thing for me to do politically, but I felt I should do it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And, I didn’t know that I would go up in the polls opposed to down.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I did that because I really felt there had to be something done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That was after the horrible San Bernardino, California situation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"After, obviously, Paris which was terrible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we talk about Paris with the gun-free zones, we talk about Paris with their strong gun laws, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody had guns except for the bad guys.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"If we would have had guns on the other side going, in terms of Second Amendment having to do, if bullets were — same thing with San Bernardino.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If bullets were going in the opposite direction, you wouldn’t have had the problems in those two places, that I can tell you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I think we have to be extremely careful with our Second Amendment, and we have to cherish our Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Very important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, I would say this, when I called for the temporary banning, we have to look at it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have a serious problem, I think you’ll admit that, Brian.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have a very, very serious problem with radical Islam, and if we don’t want to discuss it, and if we don’t want to look at it, we’re never going to solve the problem.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We have to be extremely strong with ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to wipe ISIS off the face of the Earth so fast and so violently we have no choice.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We have no choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, I was against the war in Iraq.",0,1,0,0,1,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am not a fast trigger.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m exactly the opposite of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We should have never gone in, it destabilized the Middle East.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"But, I will tell you this, we got out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Obama got us out very badly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Instead of leaving some troops, instead of giving a date, instead of, you know, with the exact time, I would say this though — we have no choice but to look at that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to be very, very vigilant.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Very smart, and frankly, Brian, we have to be very tough because it’s only going to get worse.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thousands of people are being allowed into this country over short periods of time coming supposedly from Syria.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"We have no idea who they are, we have no idea where is their paperwork.",0,0,1,1,0,0
They have no paperwork; they have no identification.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"They’re coming into  this country and it’s going to be a big, big problem.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"The other, though, part of Lieutenant Murphy’s question was about protecting the rights of minority groups, of Muslims, or Sikhs, of Jews, and others inside the United States…",0,0,0,1,0,1
"…  I want to do that also, and I do want to do that, but I at the same time we have to recognize we have a serious problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me follow up on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You said you agreed, I think you said you agreed, with Senator Ted Cruz’s proposal in the wake of the Brussels attack that law enforcement should, quote, “patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.” I talked to him about this in the last hour.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Bill Bratton, Commissioner, the Chief of Police…",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Chief of Police under Giuliani, as well as now de Blasio, again — out in L.A.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"He said about Ted Cruz’s proposal, “we do not patrol and secure neighborhoods based on selective enforcement because of race or religion.” Is he wrong?",0,0,0,1,1,1
"I think we have to be extremely vigilant in those areas, we have to look very seriously at the Mosques.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Lots of things happening in the Mosques, that’s been proven.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You look at what’s going on in Paris where Mosques are being closed, OK?",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And, we have to look very, very seriously.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There’s a lot of Muslims in America who hear that, saying we got to look seriously at the Mosques…",0,0,0,0,0,0
"…  Let me just tell you something, in San Bernadino people know what was going on.",0,0,0,0,0,1
These two people — probably became radicalized through her.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Who knows?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I would also say health care, I would also say education.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, there are many, many things, but I would say the top three are security, security, security.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to have security for our country so that we can continue to exist as a country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We are in danger.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thousands and thousands of people are infiltrating our country.,0,0,1,1,1,1
We don’t know who they are.,0,0,1,0,0,1
There’s a very vicious world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re living in a very vicious world and we’re doing something that is against a lot of very smart people’s wishes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I can tell you, it’s totally against my wishes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So top three, you’re saying, security.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I say all top three are security, but health care, education, would be probably three that would be top.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And then you can go on from there.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Believe me, we’ve never been in a position, in my opinion, where our country is so vulnerable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our military is being eaten away.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When General Odierno left recently, a year ago, I was watching him on maybe your show, one of the shows, and he said that the United States Army, the United States military forces have never been so — and I think he used the word depleted.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But basically he said they’re exhausted.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So just to follow-up, though…",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that’s a pretty — that’s a pretty sad commentary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And honestly, even though he was retiring at the time — and I had a lot of respect for him, good man, but even though he was leaving at the time, people shouldn’t say that because you’re giving the enemy ideas.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if I get in, our military will be bigger, better, stronger than ever before.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s the cheapest thing we can do.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"So in terms of federal government role, you’re saying security, but you also say health care and education should be provided by the federal government?",0,0,0,0,0,1

"The federal government, but the concept of the country is the concept that we have to have education within the country, and we have to get rid of common core and it should be brought to the state level.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And federal health care run by the federal government?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Health care — we need health care for our people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need a good — Obamacare is a disaster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s proven to be…,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The government can lead it, but it should be privately done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It should be privately done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So that health care — in my opinion, we should probably have — we have to have private health care.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We don’t have competition in health care.,0,0,0,0,0,1

But they’re taking care of everyone else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait one second.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don’t have — we don’t have bidding.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don’t have competition in health care.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And it’s a disaster.,0,0,0,0,0,0

No it’s not.,0,0,1,0,0,0

Are you going to have your campaign pay you back?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I doubt it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it just seems to be the way it’s done.,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Ukraine —,0,0,0,0,0,0
You really think NATO is obsolete?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I think it’s largely obsolete, yes.",0,0,0,1,0,0
It’s got to be changed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s got to be — you don’t talk about terror.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our single biggest threat right now is terror, okay?",0,0,0,1,0,0

"So subtract that from 1,237, and we get a new magic number: 1,193.",0,0,0,0,1,1
So that's probably the maximum that he needs here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the real number Trump will need before he starts picking up what we think are those unbound delegates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now again, we think this is a conservative estimates.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It's possible Trump can win more of these votes.,0,0,0,0,0,0

And then momentum could take over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He could pick up more of those folks and then his magic number could drop from 1,193 down to 1,150 after the last primary.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And in fact, it may be very hard for the ""Stop Trump"" movement to keep Trump below 1,150.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Either way, while Trump technically still needs 1,237 in that first ballot, it's clear he does not need that many pledged delegates by the end of voting in June.",0,0,0,0,1,1

Welcome back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The panel is back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's start quickly with some reaction to Bernie Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Joy?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Poor people don't vote?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
An interesting new excuse from Bernie Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then some Hillary supporters have pointed it out, ""Oh, first it was the South, now it's poor people.""",0,0,0,1,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it really got a huge reaction, just when the preview of the sound came out in just my social media world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think part of the problem is the word you use, the excuses.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That you're saying you're running a political revolution, but you keep parsing, ""Well, we don't have just the right kind of voter motivated enough or informed enough.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You know, they're too old-fashioned, or they're too conservative.""",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And in this case, sort of putting it off on poverty, I don't think he meant to disparage, clearly, people, and impugn people who are poor.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But the idea is if you are truly running a revolutionary movement, based on lifting up people at the bottom, then they should be hearing your message or you might not be doing something correctly.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You know, look, I think at another time and in another conversation, this would have been an important conversation to have.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it's a fact of life that in the United States, the amount of people who were citizens in the United States, who aren't registered to vote, and could vote, are huge.",0,0,0,0,1,1

"I mean look, at Telemundo, we have a campaign, yo resido , it's bringing in people to register to vote.",0,0,0,0,1,1
It would be a different country if everyone was registered to vote.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It's just that conversation at the time you had it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the only people who give excuses for why they're losing are the people who should probably be out.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"He can't be the nominee, and he can't win.",0,0,1,1,0,0
People believe in him.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's conciliatory.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And he said--,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because he knows he’s going to lose.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Robert?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"This is someone who has not climbed the ladder, forming relationships with social conservatives along the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He's someone forged in New York's tabloid business culture, he has relationships with all kinds of people, he's not just someone who surrounds himself with Republicans and conservatives.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Well, because Donald Trump is clearly, he has exposed the fact that a lot of the base of the Republican party are not movement conservatives who have spent their entire lives pouring over the doctrinaire minutia of conservative beliefs.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And what he said was common sense.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that is the big risk of Trump.,0,0,0,1,0,0
He could be anything in the general election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He could pivot back on social issues to a place where he's not offending Democratic voters.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"When we come back, U.S. insists there's no evidence that any high-level Saudi Arabian government officials played a role in plotting 9/11.",0,0,0,1,1,1
So why does the American government refuse to release 28 pages of a congressional report that could tell a different story?,0,0,0,1,0,1
"President Obama's been on the world stage this week, meeting the Queen of England, and a future king, Prince George even stayed up past his bedtime to meet the President.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Just the governor of Riyadh, roughly the equivalent of the United States sending a local governor to greet a major foreign leader when they land on U.S. soil.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"U.S./Saudi relations are strained, to put it mildly, at the moment.",0,0,0,0,0,1
With renewed calls in Washington to declassify 28 pages of a congressional report on 9/11 that some believe allege some direct links to the Arab kingdom when it comes to the 9/11 attacks.,0,0,1,1,1,1
It's a link the Saudis have strenuously denied for years.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Well, I'm joined by one of the chief proponents of declassifying those 28 pages, former Senator Bob Graham of Florida.",0,0,0,1,1,1

"Thank you, Chuck.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's go right to the specifics of these 28 pages.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What is in them that the American-- high levels of American officials and Saudi officials fear will change things if they become public?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Chuck, to me, the most important unanswered question of 9/11 is did these 19 people conduct this very sophisticated plot alone, or were they supported?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I think it's implausible to think that people who couldn't speak English, had never been in the United States before, as a group were not well-educated could have done that.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So who was the most likely entity to have provided them that support?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think all the evidence points to Saudi Arabia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We know that Saudi Arabia started Al Qaeda.,0,0,0,1,1,1
It was a creation of Saudi-- of Saudi Arabia..,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And when you say Saudi Arabia, are you saying the government?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Or are you saying wealthy individuals who happen to be Saudi Arabian?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is a very murky line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Saudi Arabia has made it murky by its own legal action.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"Whenever a U.S. group sues a Saudi Arabian entity, whether it’s a bank, a foundation, a charity, immediately, the defense of sovereign immunity is raised.",0,0,1,1,1,1
The Saudis don't recognize the difference between a royal decision and a societal decision in the same way that other countries might.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"So I think it covers a broad range, from the highest ranks of the kingdom through these, what would be private entities.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If this gets released publicly, and again, I know you don't want to say what's in it, you don't want to-- but let me ask you this.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"One description that has been made of these 28 pages is that it's basically an initial police report that if you looked at it, you would say, ""Wow, we should investigate that, that, that and that more.""",0,0,0,1,0,1
Is that the best way to describe this?,0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This report was 850 pages.,0,0,0,0,1,1
This is 28 pages out of that.,0,0,0,0,1,0
There's been no questions raised about the professionalism and quality of the other 820 pages of this report.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And this chapter followed the same standards that they did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Instead of debating what might be there, why don't we let the American people read the 28 pages, and the other thousands of documents that have been withheld that relate to the Saudi involvement in 9/11.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And then make up their own mind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What keeps this from-- why do I feel like candidate Barack Obama or Senator Barack Obama might be in a different place?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"What is it within the minute somebody gets into the executive branch, Republican or Democrat, there is this consensus publicly to protect Saudi Arabia?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it goes back to the fact that 60 years ago, Franklin Roosevelt and the King of Saudi Arabia entered into a special relationship.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We provided them with security, they provided us with petroleum.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And that has affected the culture and the attitude around this relationship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think it's fundamentally changed, it's changing almost on a daily basis, as we are less dependent on the Saudis for petroleum, as some of the things that the Saudis are doing are so dramatically adverse to our interests, such as training the next generation of the young terrorists in their mosque in schools -- their madrasas.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The schism between the United States and Saudi Arabia is now very apparent.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And I think this is the time to inject the truth of that relationship in the process of deciding what we should be doing in the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The president, can he order the declassification on his own?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The president has the full responsibility and the authority to do so.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I hope that he will do so and again, not only for these 28 pages, but there are 80,000 documents in a federal courtroom in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, relative to an investigation that took place on a relationship between Mohamed Atta, the leader of the 19--",0,0,0,1,1,1

Very accurate there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So pretty, you think it will have a high level negative impact?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, Senator Bob Graham, I'm going to leave it there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You'll see, you think you'll get it done?",0,0,0,0,0,0
You think you'll get these released?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The President's staff at least has said that they will make a decision by June.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And I hope that decision is to honor the American people and make it available.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And the game that at least gets played late in presidential primary campaign, veep stakes.",0,0,0,1,0,0
It's a weird one this year.,0,0,0,0,0,0

But let's go to The New York Times threw out the first of the veepstakes when it comes to at least Hillary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think we have an idea of what the Hillary Clinton short list is, and then the people that they have to publicly say they're vetting.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And the Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who Joy, I want to start with you, and I want to start with him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because he has basically earned his way onto the Clinton campaign's decision to make him on the shortlist.,0,0,0,0,1,0
This came from a Clinton official.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it was Perez that they put on there initially.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're not hearing as much about Julián Castro, the HUD secretary that everybody fell in love with as the Latino V.P.",0,0,0,0,0,0
of the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, and I think with Julián Castro, I think maybe the idea of the age, sort of the juxtaposition of him with Hillary Clinton,",0,0,0,0,0,0
Too much so?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Tom Perez is somebody is very much respected by Obama world, clearly.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And so I think that there is this thinking that either the Clinton campaign, in just in sort of talking to the Clinton world, that they either feel like they need to have a Latino to pair with him, to galvanize the Latino electorate, or they need to fix what you could call their ""white male"" problem.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And go with somebody that is a progressive white male like a Sherrod Brown or like an Al Franken even, somebody like that that would be outside the box that could help her there.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And she kind of liked that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's interesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think Ross Perot said when he was running for president that in his corporate life, he never hired anybody who didn't want his job, because that's the way they all grew.",0,0,1,0,0,1
This is the antithesis of that.,0,0,0,1,0,0
You don't want to hire someone who wants your job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And maybe that would be someone like Senator Nelson of Florida.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But don't rule out Secretary Castro either.,0,0,0,1,0,0
He's an extremely charismatic person.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We get four veepstakes instead of two.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Anyway you guys are terrific.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I appreciate it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Finally though, in memory of Prince, Bruce Springsteen started his show last night by playing a Prince classic, Purple Rain.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So we're going to end our broadcast the same way, with Bruce playing Prince.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And of course, as always if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And welcome back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is history all around us here at downtown Milwaukee’s Riverside Theater, which opened in 1928.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It was nearly destroyed by fire in 1966.,0,0,1,0,1,1
It was lovingly restored in the 80s and has been at the heart of this city’s cultural life ever since.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It is a magnificent theater.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’re here in the mid of a history-making Republican presidential campaign, bringing voters face to face with the candidates, showcasing their questions and bringing it all to you at home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Joining us now is Ohio’s governor, John Kasich.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
How are you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Good to see you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Have a seat.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, we got a lot of questions from the audience about a lot of policy issues.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A couple of questions on news of the day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Donald Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, charged today with simple battery.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Would you fire him?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I haven’t seen the video, but they tell me the video is real.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Of course I would.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, when you have problems like that, you have to act.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I’ve been of course an executive running the seventh-largest state.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we see things that happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At times, you want to give people the benefit of the doubt, but when you see things that are pretty clear – from what I understand the video is clear.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course would fire him.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Let’s talk about your path to the nomination.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You are pinning your hopes on a contested convention.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Assuming there is one, why would you be selected?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You’ve only won one state, your home state, Ohio.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Why would you get the nomination?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, a couple of reasons, Anderson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, in virtually every national poll, I am the only one that beats Hillary Clinton consistently.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"In fact, in the last poll that came out I was up 11 points.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Secondly, and, you know, delegates would look, for example, at, you know, can you win in the fall?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, it’s like a really important part of this thing, it’s not just the nomination, it’s about winning the election.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And frankly, if we do not have a strong candidate that brings people together, we have a prospect of losing the United States Senate as well.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And secondly, Anderson, at some point that people that go to a convention are going to be concerned about who actually could run the country.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I mean, it’s like a big deal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, who could be president, who could be commander-in-chief?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have more experience than really all of them put together except for Mrs. Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, I have — you know, I served 18 years on the defense — Armed Services Committee, I was in the Pentagon after 9/11.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I was chairman of the Budget Committee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was involved in welfare reform.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I was chairman of the Budget Committee, we balanced the budget, we had job growth.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I’ve been the executive in Ohio.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ve grown jobs.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"So at some point people are going to look at two things, who can win in the fall, and secondly who could be the best president?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But polls are one thing, though, I mean, to have only won — if it continues on this path, to have only won one state, your home state, won’t some delegates say, look, OK, the polls say he can win in a head-to-head matchup against Hillary Clinton, but the voters have spoken.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Well, Anderson, I think it’s pretty clear and most of the people in here I think would agree with this, for most of the debates, I was completely ignored.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I mean, it has been like the last three weeks to a month that people have started to pay attention to who I am and my message.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it has fundamentally happened that way because I’ve not gotten down in the mud.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I haven’t name-called.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I haven’t had all these nasty sound bites.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve just been laying out my record and my vision for what I want to see happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But conventions are very interesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Republicans have had 10 conventions.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And the leader going into the convention has only been the nominee three times out of 10.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Seven times out of 10 they were not.,0,0,0,0,1,1
So I think — and we’re going to do better as this calendar moves to the east.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, now I’m starting to get on my home court, you know, — look, I went to Ohio, I won by 11 points.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"You know, I did very, well there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’re going to go to Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut.",0,0,0,0,0,0
These are all places where I can do extremely well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we will continue to accumulate delegates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we’ll have momentum going into the convention.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, the convention is nothing more than an extension of the process we have going now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Somehow people think they’re truncated somehow, they’re disjointed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re not.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It’s a process of primaries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You accumulate delegates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You go to the convention.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And then they pick the nominees.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to ask you about terrorism.,0,0,0,1,0,0
When you were asked about what happened in Brussels last week — or let’s talk about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In terms of what U.S. response should and what the fight against ISIS should look like, you said yesterday that one of the opponents wants to make the sand glow and the other one complains about other countries not doing enough, obviously you were talking about Senator Cruz and Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Why would America be safer under your watch?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Anderson, first of all, I’ve been saying for a long time and laid out an extensive program on rebuilding the military.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Secondly, I’ve been the one arguing all along that we need to go after ISIS in a coalition like we had in the first Gulf War.",0,0,0,0,1,0
I was there when I saw it happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I saw our Muslim Arab friends join us in the West, and we pushed Saddam out of Kuwait.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"You know, secondly, that same coalition needs come together and we need to destroy ISIS both in the air and on the ground, settle it down and then come home.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And let the regional powers draw the map.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are a lot of countries, Saudi Arabia, that don’t necessarily see ISIS as their predominant threat.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Oh, no, no, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the Gulf states, they all know it’s an existential threat.",0,0,1,1,0,1
They know that they — that the kingdom hangs by a thread because of the radicalism of ISIS.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And so the fact is they will join us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They joined us before against Saddam Hussein.,0,0,0,0,1,0
That was not as big of a deal as this is where they’re blowing people up all over the world.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Secondly, of course, I think, Anderson, that we need really good worldwide intelligence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that the lemons we’re seeing can be turned into lemonade and I think a president of the United States can rally the civilized world to destroy these folks who are intent on destroying us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And secondly, we talked about NATO.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That was another thing I talked about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need to change NATO from not just a military organization, but an intelligence-gathering and also a policing organization that works across boundaries.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All of us together, fighting together, working together, destroy ISIS, have the good human intelligence…",0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump says NATO is obsolete.,0,1,0,1,1,0
Is it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, of course it’s not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That’s absurd, obsolete, OK?",0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, look, it’s really important that we get these countries to pitch in and do more.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They’ll never do as much as we want.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, I lived through a whole time when we would push them, pressure them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Part of the problem is it’s their governments over there.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You know, there is too much socialism, there is too much political correctness.",0,0,0,1,0,0
That’s why they didn’t even catch this thing in Brussels.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And you know that the screw-ups that we saw with the intelligence.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"But here’s the thing: no, NATO has an additional role now.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And that is policing and intelligence gathering.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You see, we need to have the Muslims working with us and the West —",0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s critical?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely critical.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me tell you, Anderson, if we wanted to get information out of some radical that’s in a mosque — you’re a really great guy, but if you were three blocks from the mosque, do you think you’d get anything?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t blend very well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, you are don’t.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, the fact is is that we want the Muslims who are — they feel as strongly as we do about these murderers out there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These Muslims, they’re the ones that have to police their own neighborhoods.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, frankly, we need the imams to come out and issue statements about how their religion has been hijacked.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it takes all of us together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It takes us to have great human intelligence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And here in the United States we’ve got counterterrorism task forces made up of the FBI, it’s made up of Homeland Security, state and local law enforcement, and their job is to disrupt.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"That’s why the issue of Apple was so important because they need the resources to be able to carry out their job for all of us, but they need one other thing: they need the tools.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And if they can’t hear, then it becomes a problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But there’s also a role for us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because when we see something happening in our neighborhood, Anderson, we have an obligation to alert authorities as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You talked about Donald Trump belittle — in an interview today, you said about Donald Trump’s foreign, “I think that’s the most ridiculous of foreign policy I ever heard.",0,0,0,1,0,0
This is just somebody that just doesn’t understand foreign policy.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Just doesn’t” —,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well which part was I talking about?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t remember.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I’m not sure either.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"OK. Well, I mean, I think the idea that – I’ll tell you one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think he –,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to have a religious test on who comes in the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, when you come in the country, I say, well, are you a Muslim?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Raise your hand if you’re a Muslim.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, come on, Anderson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s not going to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re not going to police Muslim neighborhoods.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We can’t afford polarization of people who are in the civilized world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, there are people all over the world that know that this threat has to be stopped.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has to be destroyed, and we have to work together as a world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because when people in Pakistan die, we all die a little bit when they blow up innocent men, women and children at an Easter service.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I mean, the world understands this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And this is an opportunity for us to be brought together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The president, by the way, went to a baseball game in Cuba instead of coming home, meeting.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I’ll tell you what I would do if I were president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would come home, I would call world leaders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would gather my military and intelligence experts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would find out our vulnerabilities, and I would send them to Europe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I would say, let us look at what our problems are, and let’s fix them immediately.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The response of the White House is often to that criticism –,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"The response of the White House to that criticism, and I want you to be able to respond to it, is often, well, look.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"By changing the president’s schedule, it gives power to the terrorist group that they’re able to change the leader of the free world’ s schedule and that he can do the work he needs to do on wherever location he’s at.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So you kind of go to a baseball game, and you don’t come home?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that’s another issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And – no, here’s the situation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That attack was in the heart of Europe.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I mean, that was an attack on the very heart of our friends who live in Europe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I think it’s important enough to come home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secondly  —,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
— I’ll give you another one that I can’t believe.,0,0,0,1,0,0
The president of the United States — the first thing he did is he wouldn’t meet with our friend Netanyahu.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"OK, that was the first meeting he snubbed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, he’s snubbed another one.",0,0,0,1,0,0
He’s snubbed a meeting with the president of Turkey.,0,0,1,0,1,0
Do you know how important it is for to us have good relations with Turkey?,0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re the gateway to the East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, Erdogan is doing some things that none of us like.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But you know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to deal with him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He is the one that alerted the Europeans about the radical that was moving over to Brussels.,0,0,0,0,1,0
You have to be able to manage this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I tell you, it’s complicated, it takes sophistication.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you need to have good advisers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I’ll tell you what else you need.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You need experience, and you need a good gut.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I’ve been involved in these things for almost all of my adult lifetime.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I have advisers, but I don’t have many teachers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I understand most of these things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ve talked about Trump’s campaign manager.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Your campaign manager tweeted this just a couple of hours ago.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Quote, “Cruz with zero friends, zero record, zero vision, zero chance decides to lie about @JohnKasich.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Desperate?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Trump right on one thing, “lying Ted.”",0,0,0,0,0,0
Does this signal any kind of a new phase –,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I didn’t know he – you know, because sometimes he gets a little tweet happy, and I don’t like that, OK?",0,0,0,1,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will have a word with him about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me say – that look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Cruz campaign, their super PAC is spending a half a billion (sic) to $800,000 against me in Wisconsin.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"I mean, they say, well, Kasich doesn’t have any strength out here.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"Usually, if you don’t have any strength, they don’t spend $500,000 to $800,000 attacking you.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"And you know, the attacks are – look.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Arnold Schwarzenegger told me in 2010 when I was running for governor, I was saying, Arnold, they’re really beating me up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He looked at me and said, “John, love the beatings.”  Okay, that’s part of politics, and I’ve learned to love the beatings.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I mean, the fact is, is that they are hammering me, and they’re not hammering Trump.",0,0,1,1,0,0
It’s very interesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But that’s okay; I can take it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In terms of tone and tenor of the campaign, your two fellow candidates have obviously been duking it out over the last week or so…",0,0,0,0,0,0
The last week or so?,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
How about the last five months?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Where you been, Anderson?",0,0,0,0,0,0
In this new phase on the whole…,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s why I’m not in the news.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn’t call anybody a name.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And you know what, I’m in the going to take the low road to the highest office in the land.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m not going to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s my question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That was my question, which was, what does it look like from the sidelines when you watch this?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’ll tell you, sometimes it’s amazing to me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sometimes when I look at it I think, what the heck are we doing here?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I was on a radio talk show with some guy here, Jay somebody or other, I don’t remember this morning — yes, whatever his name is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
Nice guy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nice guy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And he was — and even yesterday I was on a different one, and a guy says to me, well, you know, maybe this is the new politics.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If name calling, bringing in spouses and ripping each other below the belt and wrestling in the mud is the new politics, we all need to stand against it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our children are watching.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to talk about what we’re for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have been consistent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, when they say something on policy-wise that’s bad, of course I’m going to say something about it, but I don’t want to go down into — I’m not going to go down there.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I hope not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I could screw up but I hope not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Let’s go to our audience for some issues (ph).,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jim Vogel (ph) is here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He works in advertising.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He says he’s leaning right now towards Senator Cruz.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jim, welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hi, governor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In Ohio you accepted Medicaid expansion and you took on the — I’m sorry, the health care exchanges and it was to help the poor.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Here in Wisconsin we used — Governor Walker used BadgerCare to essentially provide the same services at the same levels, and yet we did it without creating a whole new entitlement program and expanding federal debt.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Why did you choose Obamacare?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why did you choose the Washington-based solution?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And why can’t you guys ever look at some other source other than Washington for these solutions?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, let me say a couple of things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, it’s not so simple what Governor Walker did here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you look at it, it’s more complicated.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, today the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel endorsed me for president of the United States saying I’m the guy that is a pragmatic conservative that can get things done.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I was really appreciative of that endorsement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But look, I took a Medicaid program that was growing at 10 1/2 percent, and in my second year as governor it grew at 2 1/2 percent, without taking one person off the rolls or cutting one benefit.",0,0,1,0,1,1
How did I do it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I brought innovation to the system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now I then had a choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now that my program was under control, I then had a choice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Could I bring money back, which is frankly our money, Ohio money, back to Ohio to solve some of our problems.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me tell what you we’ve done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t believe the mentally ill ought to be sleeping under a bridge or living in prison.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"It costs $22,500 a year to put them in prison.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"If I can get their medication and get them on their feet and if get they can get a job, they become taxpayers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We save money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, I believe that the drug addicted in our prisons should be treated, because we don’t want a revolving door of in and out of the prisons, because that costs $22,500 a year, and we also are throwing a life down the drain.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"So guess what, because of our program now in the prisons and with the community, we have an 80 percent success rate in not having people go back in, and our recidivism rate is 27 percent.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And, by the way, we’re running a $2 billion surplus.",1,0,0,1,1,1
We don’t put our budget together with scotch tap and bail and wire — we’re running a $2 million surplus.,0,0,0,1,1,0
We’re managing it all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So where are we?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Where we are in Ohio, is we are not treating the mentally ill, the drug addicted, the working poor, they’re in a better position, they’re not in our prisons, and at the same time, they’re getting on their feet, they’re becoming taxpayers and our Medicaid program is completely under control.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And by the way, I reject Obamacare, and I did not go along with the exchange that they were trying to force on me, because I never knew what the heck was going to come of it.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"I actually have a solid health care plan to replace Obamacare, which involves transparency, competition, market-oriented forces.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’re actually doing it in my state, and I’d like to spread it all across the country.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"So the idea of doing that was not only compassionate, but it also made good economic sense for our state and it’s working out quite well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you for your question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, I want you too meet, this is Julie Grace.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She’s a student at Marquette University…,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know what, just one other thing I wanted to say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You understand that I spent 10 years of my life fighting to balance the budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we got it balanced.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Domenici and I worked with the Clinton administration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We got the budget balanced four years in a row.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"It hadn’t been balanced since man walked on the moon, hasn’t been balanced since.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And when I left Washington, there was a $5 trillion surplus, and guess who spent it?",0,0,1,1,1,1
The Republicans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, sir, you have to stand in the breach when you’re a leader.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what I did in Washington in getting that budget under control, and seeing it liftoff in jobs, and what I’ve done in Ohio, we’re now up 417,000 jobs in Ohio from a downturn of when I came in of 350,000.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And we’ve cut taxes by more than any governor in the country, including your governor.",0,0,0,0,1,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want you to meet Julie Grace, she’s a student at Marquette University.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And she said she’s supporting you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, you are?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I am.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK.  Say something really, really good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ll try.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So in Europe many far right conservative parties, anti-immigrant parties have been gaining momentum recently, specifically Germany, Sweden, France, and Britain.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Do you think a similar movement is occurring here in the U.S.?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if so, how can the Republican Party address this?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ve gone through periods of time in our history when we have turned against immigration.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It has happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And these movement have sprung up.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Look, we have to — young lady, we have to protect the border.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That is a given, OK?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For a couple of reasons, and one of them is security.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So we have to get the border done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And secondly, we should have a guest worker program where people can come in and work, and then they can go back home, because that’s what they want to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And thirdly, if they came here illegally but they’ve not committed a crime since they’ve been here, they’ll pay a fine, back taxes, and they can have a path to legalization, not a path to citizenship.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Now the idea that we’re going to drive around in Waukesha and we’re going to drive around here in Milwaukee, and we’re going to yank people out of their homes, leaving their kids on the front porch crying and screaming?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Come on, that’s ridiculous, OK?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Call it what it is, it’s ridiculous.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But we can get the border fixed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can have a guest worker program.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We can get a path to legalization, not let anybody else come.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have got to go back, no excuses.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you want to know what I think?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that can pass.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that can pass the United States Congress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it can pass with the American people and get this issue behind us and get this thing healed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need a healing in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And stop kicking cans down the road and solve problems in this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that’s a reasonable solution to this problem of immigration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you for your question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is Asa White, he’s a student also, says he’s leaning towards supporting Donald Trump right now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Asa, welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My question — the most recent terrorist attack in Brussels has highlighted a big issue we have with our attack on foreign terrorism.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"That is, we now have neighborhoods that are being deemed as terrorist hotbeds.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Do you support Senator Cruz’s — when he says we should go into Muslim neighborhoods and patrol them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I don’t support that at all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it’s ridiculous.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The guy who was the best police guy in the whole country, he understands policing, is a guy named Bill Bratton.",0,0,0,0,0,1
He’s now currently the police chief in New York.,0,0,0,0,0,1
He was the police chief under Rudy Giuliani.,0,0,0,0,0,1
He was the head of the metro system in Boston.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And he ran the Los Angeles Police Department.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He is absolutely the best.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He said that plan is ridiculous.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"And let me just tell you, sir, we all want to catch these bad guys.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I know how it works because I’ve got Joint Terrorism Task Force members who are in my state, they’re in your state.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We need to hear what’s happening in the community.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So let me just — let me ask you this question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If all of a sudden we start trying to pinpoint you — we have a religious test, we’re going to now patrol your neighborhood and your home because we suspect,  even though you’re as law-abiding as anybody else in the country.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Now I want you to help me find out who the bad guys are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, come on, that doesn’t make any sense that if we polarize the entire Muslim community, how are we going to get the information we want?",0,0,0,1,0,0
We want Muslims who go to mosques who see radicalization to tell the authorities about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I have got to tell you, the vast, vast, vast majority of Muslims, they think their religion has been hijacked, that we have murderers out there who have distorted their religion.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And they want to stop had as much as we want to stop it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So the fact is let’s isolate those people who are the killers and let’s work together as a community of civilized people to take the battle to them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Destroy ISIS, that’s a given, and then after that great intelligence to make sure we can thwart these attacks and get the Europeans to start, you know, paying attention and doing their job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, that’s what I think we need to do, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you for your question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
This is Jim Walker.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He’s a Republican from Franklin, Wisconsin.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"He said he’s leaning towards Ted Cruz for his experience, but likes you because you run a blue-collar state.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jim, welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you very much, Anderson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And welcome to the great state of Wisconsin, governor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I represent a manufacturer, farm equipment manufacturer, here in Wisconsin that directly employs many thousands of people.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Indirectly, as you can imagine, with farm equipment that we sell, we indirectly support many more thousand farmers who buy our equipment.",0,1,0,0,1,1
On top of that we export about a third of our product that we manufacture here in essence.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"So in essence, we’re a global manufacturing company.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"To spark a war right now would not only be detrimental to business, but all of those people directly and indirectly that I said we support.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"My question to you is, as president, how would you engage in diplomacy that won’t hurt global manufacturing businesses?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, number one, I want you to know, sir, that in my state now, we have over 63,000 new manufacturing jobs.",0,1,0,0,1,1
"It’s really cool that — and we’re paying attention to all the sectors, which we need to do as a nation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let’s talk about trade for a second.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s a tough issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One out of five Americans work for something related to trade, and secondly, that’s 38 million Americans.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Now we need to have open and free trade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I was saying — I do these townhalls all the time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I love them, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, remember when we got all of those Japanese cars coming into our country?",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what happened to U.S. cars?,0,0,0,1,0,0
They got better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Innovation and competition really works, okay.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But at the same time when we do trade agreements and other countries cheat, and they do cheat — some of them manipulate their currency, and we need to call them on it when they do it.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"When we find it, we need to call them on it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me tell you another issue for you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we had U.S. steel invest a lot of money in state.,0,0,0,1,1,0
They invest money all over the country.,0,0,1,0,1,1
The Koreans were dumping tubes inside the U.S.  That means selling product below the cost of what it took them to make  them.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"By the time you research them and prove your case, which you would have to do, it could be a year or two and all your people are out of work.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We need an early-warning system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And let me tell you, when they cheat, I will act as the president of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Think of it this way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If Ohio State came up to play your beloved Badgers and I asked for five downs to get a first down and you only got four, how would you feel?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You wouldn’t put up with it, okay?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We should not put up with countries when they cheat.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But that does not keep us from embracing the notion of open and free trade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One other thing, we now have this trade agreement on the table, you the TPP agreement.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"You know, what we basically do when we trade is we’re the most open country, and everybody else has barriers.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So what we try to  do is to get their barriers down so we  get our products into their country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But there’s another element of this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You worry about the Chinese and their growing strength, particularly in Asia?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Make a trade agreement, integrate ourselves with our friends in Asia who can become a bulwark against the strength of the Chinese.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But governor…,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
(inaudible) open trade good when they cheat.,0,1,0,0,0,0
You’ve got to have an early-warning system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You’ve got to shut it off.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, agriculture depends on exports more than about any other industry in this country.",0,1,0,0,1,1
"But, governor, that message isn’t resonate — I mean, Donald Trump is saying trade deals are essentially bad.",0,0,0,1,1,0
They’re exporting jobs overseas.,0,0,1,0,1,1
That’s the message which seems to be resonating with voters.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Anderson, I can say all kinds of things to get people stirred up, but leaders don’t do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Leaders tell people the way that they see it, even if it means for a while you’re unpopular.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, when I — after my first — you can’t believe how many people I made angry in Washington by fighting to balance the budget.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Now in Ohio, in my first year in office, I was one of the most unpopular governors, but I knew what the formula was, and now I’m one of the most popular governors.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You cannot make decisions as a leader by putting your finger in the air and — or doing focus groups or telling people what they want to hear so you get them involved, but you know what they’re saying — what you’re saying is not true.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will not do that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I have never done it in my lifetime, and I’m not about to start.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Period and end of story.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
This is William Dunford.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He’s a student at Marquette University.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He says he supports Ted Cruz — William.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, governor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"My question is, 70 years after World War II and a quarter century after the Cold War ended, a lot of European security remained a responsibility for Americans?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And given that Europeans are wealthy enough to defend themselves, why shouldn’t they?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, young man, look, I don’t know if you’re a leader in your family or not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But leaders, you know, there are people in here who do more for their family than their brothers and sisters, their siblings.",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And sometime, your spouse says why do we have do this all the time?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because that’s what leaders do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, frankly, of course, the Europeans can do more to support themselves.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Their economies, by and large, have been a shambles.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So, they need to straighten out their economies.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it’s a really tough struggle.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, I can tell you that it’s hard for them to get right with things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, they are weak economically.",0,0,1,0,1,0
That doesn’t excuse them from not carrying their share of the load.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But at the same time, we don’t want to have those relationships deteriorate or be eliminated.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because it hurts us, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to have a strong Western Europe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, I heard – I just heard briefly somebody was saying that we should just ignore Ukraine.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Are you kidding me?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The United States of America should be arming the Ukrainians who want to fight for freedom against Putin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
We should be arming them with non-lethal – with lethal defensive aid.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, young man, we should always tell them you’ve got to do more.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we should use whatever leverage we have to get them to do more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I’m going to tell you as Americans, as long as I’ve been alive, we always carry more of the share of the burden than we would like.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We always do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you know there’s an old Scripture that says “To whom much is given, much is expected.”  And as president, I would fight to get them to give us more, and I would use whatever leverage I could to get them to give us more.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But to be honest with you, we’re always going to complain about this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But to walk away from that alliance, are you kidding me?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"If we walk away and it gets weaker, how long do you think it will take the Islamists to come over here?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need to work with them to destroy ISIS in the Middle East, and then we’ve got to work together as a society.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s the way it works.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, there’s no easy way out of this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you know, when you are a leader who has seen these things, then you get a sobering approach.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s why the “Journal Centennial” here in Milwaukee said Kasich is a pragmatic conservative.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Because you just can’t knock all the pieces off the chess board when you get frustrated.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It’s a good question, there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to take a quick break.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to have more questions for Governor Kasich as this 360 CNN town hall continues.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Welcome back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We continue the conversation, taking more voter questions for Ohio governor John Kasich.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thanks very much for joining us again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to ask you a question which I asked to each of the other candidates as well, and had some surprising answers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A pledge was made early on in this race by all the GOP candidates, saying that they would pledge to support whoever the nominee was.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Tonight Donald Trump said that pledge, essentially, was null and void.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"He would not pledge to continue to support whoever the nominee is, he would have to wait and see.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, Ted Cruz wouldn’t really answer it, but implied that a lot has changed, and that not that Donald Trump has…",0,0,0,1,0,0
… Maybe I won’t answer it either.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Anderson, here’s the thing, this is what you have to weigh, and I wish everybody could get out and experience this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you’re in the arena, OK?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You develop respect for people that are in the arena, but you know?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’ve been disturbed by some of the things that I’ve seen, and I have to think about what my word and endorsement would mean in a presidential campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I want to see how this thing finishes out, and you know what?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to tell you, I think the little engine that can keeps going.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I sure hope they’ll endorse me for president when I’m the nominee coming out of the convention in Cleveland, how’s that?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Is that a good answer?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t know.,0,0,1,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would be remiss not to follow up, essentially you’re saying it’s in the balance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You’re kind of waiting to see?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I would say that that would be a good way to describe it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, you’re not ironclad, standing by the initial pledge to support whoever the nominee is?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, frankly, all of us shouldn’t have even answered that question, but it was the first debate, and — you know?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What the heck, sometimes you answer questions — you ought to just say I’m not answering it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, now, just to be clear…",0,0,0,0,0,0
… I’m as clear as you’re going to get out of me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You’re not standing by that pledge…,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I don’t want to be political here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I got to see what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the nominee is somebody that I think is really hurting the  country, and dividing the country, I can’t stand behind them, but we have a ways to go.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Let’s see how this all folds out, and then I’ll let you know…",0,0,0,0,0,0
… Is it fair to say that you believe Donald Trump looks like he would harm the country if he was the nominee?,0,0,0,1,0,0
That’ll be up to the voters here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m not going to get into that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s too much below the belt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to introduce you to Time Carey, he’s a small business owner.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He says she’s still undecided.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"My family and I raced sled dogs in Northern Wisconsin, and this last year we started a business manufacturing sled dog equipment, a partner of mine and myself.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I funded the whole thing myself so far up to this point, and I just — I was wondering what your policies on small business to help people get small businesses going, or tax incentives, or what your thoughts were on that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I hate to keep talking about my state, but it’s a good illustration of my philosophy if I become president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our small businesses pay virtually no income tax in Ohio because we want small businesses to grow, and for the young people that are here, the best chance you have of getting a job once you graduate from college is with a small business.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So, I’m for lowering the income taxes nationally.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’d like to have a 28, a 25 and a 10 percent rate because you probably pay through on your personal taxes, you have a pass-through corporation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So, we need to bring the taxes down and help small businesses.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The other thing we have to be careful of is we’re not snuffing out the small lending institutions, the community banks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was – where was I?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was in La Crosse, and I went to this little bakery.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And this woman proudly was talking about how she built this bakery business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was a fantastic place.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she said a got a $9,000 loan.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"I said, how did you get it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"She said, well, I went to one local community bank and said if you have won’t loan me the money, I’m going to go to the one down the street.",0,0,1,0,0,1
What we’re facing now in America because of the overregulation on some of the big banks that’s trickled down to the smaller banks is we’re beginning to see the smaller banks go out of business.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Those are the ones you depend upon to get the loan you need because they know you, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I think first of all, lower taxes – of course, for you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Commonsense regulation so we’re not crushing you with another stupid for that somebody in the government decides you have to abide by.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And a path to fiscal stability, a balanced budget.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Those are the things that will help you more than anything else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And one final thing: workforce development.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have got to begin to teach our kids in K through 12 and also in the community college and the four-year schools to be getting an education for a job that exists.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Don’t get educated in a vacuum.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Good luck.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Good luck.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me follow up on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sorry —,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I did a sled dog trip one time in New Hampshire many years ago, and I thought I was going to drown in the water.",0,0,0,0,0,0

How’s that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, any time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to follow up on that, because you often – and you’ve done it tonight – touting Ohio’s economic record.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"According to FactCheck.org, Ohio has actually lagged behind the nation in job growth during your tenure as governor.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So why — if that’s true, because they say –",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that’s not true.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, they say private sector job in Ohio was 9.3 percent during your tenure.",0,1,0,0,1,1

There are three things needed to grow an economy: common sense regulations; we don’t have them now.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And we closed some of the loopholes that these big companies got when they moved — you know, when they moved out of the country to get — or moved to Puerto Rico, for example, to get tax advantages.",0,0,1,1,1,1
I thought it was the right thing to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You wouldn’t believe how hard it was to get the federal budget balanced.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One time we had a conference, I wanted to present the opposition to the Clinton tax increase, and I had a specific program to fight that, and we had a Republican conference, and Newt was sitting in the back of the room, and we had 36 speakers, and 34 said, Kasich shouldn’t unveil this plan.",0,0,1,1,1,1

"I’m as a big of a reformer and an idealist as I was the day I got elected, because I believe we can  change the world and make the world better for everyone.",0,0,0,0,0,0

That’s kind of goes with the territory.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Charlote Rasmussen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She’s from the township of Butler.,0,0,0,0,0,1
She’s retired.,0,0,0,0,0,1
She says she’s undecided.,0,0,1,0,0,0

Hello.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Kasich, if you become the nominee of the party, who are you going to pick for your vice president?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you available?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You look great tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, you know what, that’s so far ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s like measuring the drapes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I picked a lieutenant governor, somebody to run with me, a great woman, she was our auditor, and I picked her to run with me because she understood what I wanted to accomplish, and she was willing to be a really great teammate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She’s done great job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So you want to pick somebody who you’re comfortable with and somebody who understands what you’re all about, and somebody who’s not afraid to speak up to you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You see, you can’t just surround yourself with sycophants.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You’ve got to have people there that can tell you, no, I don’t think that’s right, and then you argue it out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And at the end, though, at the end, once you decide, the whole team moves in the same direction.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have been able to be able to accomplish things in politics, I’m going to tell you, not because I’m so great, but I’ve been able to attract people throughout the years — I have some people that have been around me for 30 years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we form a great team, and we keep our eyes on the horizon.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you know what I believe, I think everybody wants to be involved with something that’s bigger than themselves.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that’s what I always try to represent and present in public life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So it’d be somebody along those lines.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Aaron Rodgers maybe if he had a better year next year.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ll see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going take a quick break.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to have more with Governor Kasich as our CNN Republican townhall continues from Milwaukee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ll be right back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK),0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Welcome back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re here with Governor John Kasich of Ohio.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We’re here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yesterday CNN reported that your campaign is looking to work or coordinate behind the scenes with the Cruz campaign in an effort to try to deny Donald Trump delegates to get to the nomination.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Is that something — I mean, have approached Ted Cruz directly about that yourself?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, I’m not involved in the process stuff.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, campaigns always talk.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, there is always ways they do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I’m not in the middle of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I haven’t seen Ted since the last debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I’m not involved in that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We were talking during the break about how many townhalls.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You said you’ve probably done over 200 or so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just like this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I remember, I spoke with you at a townhall that we did in South Carolina.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And one of the things you said to that has always stuck in my mind, I kind of wanted to follow up with you about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You said that this campaign has caused you to slow down.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And I wondered — it was in reference to an incident you had with a young man at a town hall.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve had many incidents.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In what way has it caused you to slow down?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, because there’s a lot of lonely people out there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They come to my meetings and they say things — I haven’t seen it in Wisconsin, but I have seen it all over the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And the young man that gave me a hug was just emblematic of what I’ve seen all over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think when people want to feel safe and for some reason they come to the townhalls I have, which are basically townhalls about how we can fix things and how we can be hopeful, and for some reason people feel safe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I — that’s the grace of the lord as far as I’m concerned, to let people feel that way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, I would also say — and this is important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to ship a lot of programs back to the states, but here’s what I really want everybody to know I believe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The spirit of our country, Anderson, doesn’t rest in the president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, the president’s important, but the spirit of our country rests in the neighborhoods, it rests in the people who are here tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’re the ones that need to change the world, we’re the ones that need to fix education, deal with the problems of the poor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, one of the things I’ve said, you take a lady who was married 50 years, her husband died, nobody calls her anymore.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Call her on a Monday, what does she do on a Thursday?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"She’s gets her hair done, then when Saturday comes, when you’re going to take her to dinner somehow not one hair is out of place.",0,0,0,0,0,0
When you pick her up she wears a dress she hadn’t worn in six months.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Are you changing the world?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When a nurse spends an extra 15 minutes with a family that’s in trouble and says things are going to be OK, Anderson, I just happen to believe — I don’t want to get too carried away here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, you know?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Lord’s given us all a certain purpose in life, and we need to carry it out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to live a life bigger than ourselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I’m not applying for sainthood, and neither is anybody else, but we can get up every day and try to live a life to help heal this world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need the solutions in Washington to create the jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is an absolute — without jobs we don’t have anything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, when we shift welfare, education, infrastructure, job training, Medicaid programs back to the states then we’ve got to run them, and we have to run them where we live.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, frankly, state government ought to be shifting more power to the neighborhoods.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s the spirit of our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The spirit of our country — don’t you think where we live?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s in you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s in you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It’s in me, and him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It’s not in somebody, you know, down in Washington D.C.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You think?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, I hope so.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to thank you for taking part.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to thank you for this town hall, we’d love to do another one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is all the time we have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to thank all the candidates, thank the voters who had such good questions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Everyone in this room who made tonight possible, including the Riverside Theater and Turner Hall here in Milwaukee.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank You.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Today I'd like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People have asked me why I am running for President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We come to work together and turn visions into reality.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We think big, and then we make it happen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton – only by me.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we can't solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.,0,0,0,1,0,0
That's why we're asking Bernie Sanders' voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because it's not just the political system that's rigged.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's the whole economy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It's rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"It's rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.",0,0,1,1,1,1
It's rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"It's rigged against you, the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar –   just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.",1,0,1,1,1,1
Brian Williams' career was destroyed for saying far less.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is a talent our country desperately needs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Here is my promise to the American voter:   If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests – and taking money from special interests.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund – doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests – in less than 2 years – secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"They totally own her, and that will never change.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Those are the stakes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton wants to be President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But she doesn't have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders' said, the judgement, to be president.",0,0,0,1,0,0
She believes she is entitled to the office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Her campaign slogan is ""I'm with her.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what my response to that is?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm with you: the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She thinks it's all about her.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know it's all about you – I know it's all about making America Great Again for All Americans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism – focusing on what's good for America's middle class – to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.",0,0,1,1,1,1
This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.,0,0,1,0,0,1
This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what we mean by America First.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our Founders understood this. One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for ""the encouragement and protection of manufactur",0,0,0,0,1,1
[ing],0,0,0,0,0,0
in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:   The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.""",0,0,0,1,0,1
I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton's disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization.",1,0,1,0,1,1
We've lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton's time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property – a crime which is continuing to this day.,1,0,1,1,1,1
"Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!",0,0,1,1,1,0
"The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America's expense.",0,0,1,0,0,1
She gets rich making you poor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Here is a quote from the book: ""At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton…at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.""",0,0,0,0,1,1
These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas – and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it.",1,0,0,1,0,0
"She has even deleted this record of total support from her book – deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)",1,0,1,0,1,1
"But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn't change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career – and it will be even worse than the Clintons' NAFTA deal.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We don't make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.",0,0,0,0,0,1

That's true.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think that your words matter more now?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, very much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think that -- that talking about millions of illegal votes is dangerous to this country...,0,0,0,1,0,0
"No, not at all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
... without presenting the evidence?,0,0,0,1,0,0
Not at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because many people feel the same way that I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And...,0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't think it undermines your credibility if there's no evidence?,1,0,0,1,0,0
"No, not at all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because they wouldn't -- they didn't come to me, believe me.",1,0,0,1,0,0

Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's -- it's -- it's bigger picture.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You -- you took some heat -- after your visit to the CIA, in front of that hallowed wall, 117 stars -- of those lost at the CIA, you talked about other things, but you also talked about crowd size at the inauguration, about the size of your rallies, about covers on Time magazine.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I just want to ask you, when does all of that matter just a little less?",0,0,0,0,0,0
When do you let it roll off your back now that you're the president?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK, so I'm glad you asked.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I went to the CIA, my first stop.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have great respect for the people in intelligence and CIA.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't have a lot of respect for in particular one of the leaders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But that's OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I have a lot of respect for the people in the CIA.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That speech was a homerun.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That speech, if you look at Fox, OK, I'll mention your network -- read -- see what Fox said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They said it was one of the great speeches.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They showed the people applauding and screaming and -- and they were all CIA.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"There was nobody -- somebody was asking Sean, Well",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you would give the same speech if you went back?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In front of that wall?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was great.,0,0,0,0,0,0

They gave me a standing ovation for a long period of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They never even sat down, most of them, during the speech.",0,0,1,0,1,0
There was love in the room.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You and other networks covered it very inaccurately.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"I hate to say this to you, and you probably won't put it on, but turn on Fox and see how it was covered and see how people respond to that speech.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That speech was a good speech.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you and a couple of other networks tried to downplay that speech.,0,0,0,1,0,0

"I am curious about the first full day here at the White House, choosing to send the press secretary out into the briefing room, summoning reporters to talk about the inaugural crowd size.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Does that send a message to the American people that that's -- that's more important than some of the very pressing issues?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Part of my whole victory was that the men and women of this country who have been forgotten will never be forgotten again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Part of that is when they try and demean me unfairly -- because we had a massive crowd of people -- we -- we had a crowd -- I looked over that sea of people and I said to myself, Wow.""",0,0,0,1,0,0
And I've seen crowds before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Big,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Therefore, I won't allow you or other people like you to demean that crowd and to demean the people that came to Washington, D.C., from faraway places because they like me.",0,0,0,1,0,0

Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You will send in the feds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What do you mean by that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's carnage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, in my speech, I got tremendous -- from certain people, the word carnage.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is carnage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's horrible carnage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is -- Afghanistan is not like what's happening in Chicago.,0,0,0,1,0,0
People are being shot left and right.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Thousands of people over a period -- over a short period of time.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"This year, which has just started, is worse than last year, which was a catastrophe.",0,0,1,0,1,1
They're not doing the job.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, if they want help, I would love to help them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will send in what we have to send in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe they're not going to have to be so politically correct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe they're being overly political correct?,0,0,0,1,0,0
Maybe there's something going on?,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you can't have those killings going on in Chicago.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Chicago is like a warzone.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Chicago is worse than some of the people that you report, in some of the places that you report about every night, in the Middle East.",0,0,0,0,1,1
So I will -- you mention federal assistance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There's federal assistance, and then there's sending in the feds.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm just curious, will you take action on your own?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want them to fix the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You can't have thousands of people being shot in a city, in a country that I happen to be president of.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Maybe it's OK if somebody else is president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want them to fix the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They have a problem that's very easily fixable.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"They're going to have to get tougher and stronger and smarter, but they got to fix the problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't want to have thousands of people shot in a city where, essentially, I'm the president.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I love Chicago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know Chicago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And Chicago is a great city.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It can be a great city.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It can't be a great city if people are shot walking down the street for a loaf of bread.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It can't be a great city.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if they are unable to fix it, that's when you would send in the feds?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, so far they have been unable -- it's been going on for years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I wasn't president.,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's a warzone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a warning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want them to straighten out the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would do -- what I would do -- I want to keep our country safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to keep our country safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What does that mean?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When they're shooting, when they're chopping off the heads of our people and other people, when they are chopping off the heads of people because they happen to be a Christian in the Middle East, when ISIS is doing things that nobody has ever heard of since medieval times, would I feel strongly about waterboarding?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"As far as I'm concerned, we have to fight fire with fire.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, with that being said, I'm going with General Mattis.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going with my secretary, because I think Pompeo is going to be phenomenon.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to go with what they say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I have spoken, as recently as 24 hours ago, with people at the highest level of intelligence, and I asked them the question.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Does it work?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Does torture work?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the answer was: Yes, absolutely.",1,0,0,0,0,0
You're now the president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you want waterboarding?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't want people to chop off the citizens' or anybody's heads in the Middle East, OK?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Because they're Christian or Muslim or anything else.,0,0,0,0,0,0

You never saw heads chopped off until a few years ago.,0,0,0,0,0,1

So we have that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're not allowed to do anything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're not playing on an even field.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will rely on Pompeo and Mattis and my group.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if they don't want to do, that's fine.",0,0,0,0,0,0

So the economy...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I just think we've had years and years of allowing our jobs to be dissipated in this country, and there's no reason for it.",0,0,0,1,0,1

"When we come back, the millions of Americans who want to know what the replacement will be for Obamacare.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm just asking about the people who are nervous and watching you for reassurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We -- here's what I can assure you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Voiceover],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And later, the moment in the Oval Office, President Trump revealing the conversation with President Obama, as they got into the motorcade, sharing that ride to the Capitol.",0,0,0,0,0,1
What was that car ride like to the Capitol?,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Voiceover],0,0,0,0,0,0
When we come back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Commercial Break],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me ask you, Mr. President, about another promise involving Obamacare, to repeal it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you told the Washington Post that your plan to replace Obamacare will include insurance for everybody.,0,0,0,0,1,1
That sounds an awful lot like universal coverage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's going to be -- what my plan is, is that I want to take care of everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not going to leave the lower 20 percent that can't afford insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just so you understand, people talk about Obamacare, and I told the Republicans this.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The best thing we can do is nothing for two years, let it explode, and then we'll go in and we'll do a new plan and the Democrats will vote for it, believe me.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Because this year, you'll have 150 percent increases.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Last year, in Arizona, 116 percent increase.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"Minnesota, sixty some odd percent increase.",0,1,1,0,1,1
And I told them -- except for one problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to get it fixed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The best thing I could do as the leader of this country, but as wanting to get something approved with support of the Democrats, if I didn't do anything for two years, they'd be begging me to do something.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I don't want to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So just so you -- Obamacare is a disaster.,0,0,0,1,0,0
It's too expensive.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's horrible health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It doesn't cover what you have to cover.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a disaster.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said to the Republican folks, and they're terrific folks, Mitch and Paul Ryan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, look, if you go fast -- and I'm OK in doing it, because it's the right thing to do -- we want to get good coverage at much less cost -- I said, if you go fast, we then own Obamacare.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They're going to put it on us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And Obamacare is a disaster waiting to explode.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you sit back and let it explode, it's going to be much easier.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the thing to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the right thing to do is to get something done now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to make sure that nobody's dying on the streets when I'm president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've seen the estimate that 18 million Americans could lose their health insurance if Obamacare is repealed and there is no replacement.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Can you assure those Americans watching this right now that they will not lose their health insurance or end up with anything less?,0,0,0,0,0,0
So nobody ever deducts all the people that have already lost their health insurance that liked it.,0,0,0,0,1,1
You had millions of people that liked their health insurance and their healthcare and their doctor and where they went.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You had millions of people that now aren't insured anymore.,0,0,1,0,1,1
I'm just asking about the people who are nervous and watching you for reassurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, we -- here's what I can assure you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are going to have a better plan, much better health care, much better service treatment, a plan where you can have access to the doctor that you want and the plan that you want.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have a much better health care plan at much less money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have an explosion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And to do it right, sit back, let it explode, and let the Democrats come begging us to help them, because it's on them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I don't want to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to give great health care at a much lower cost.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So no one who has this health insurance through Obamacare will lose it or end up with anything less?,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, you know, when you say no one, I think no one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Ideally, in the real world, you're talking about millions of people -- will no one?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And then, you know, knowing ABC, you'll have this one person on television saying how they were hurt.",0,0,1,1,0,0
OK. We want no one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We want the answer to be no one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I will say: Millions of people will be happy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, you have millions and millions and millions of people that are unhappy.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And as we walked through the White House, we asked the president about the voices, just outside in Washington, D.C., and across the country, the more than a million women, men and children who marched the day after the inauguration.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Let me just ask you while we're standing outside.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Could you hear the voices from the women's march here in Washington?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We know there were more than a million people who turned out.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And you are their president now, too.",0,0,0,0,1,0
It's true.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Could you hear them from the White House?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I couldn't hear them.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But the crowds were large, but you're going to have a large crowd on Friday, too, which is mostly pro-life people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You're going to have a lot of people coming on Friday.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will say this -- and I didn't realize this, but I was told -- you will have a very large crowd of people.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I don't know, as large or larger.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Some people say it's going to be larger, pro-life people, and they say the press doesn't cover them.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I don't want to compare crowd sizes again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, you shouldn't.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But let me just say, what they do say is that the press doesn't cover them.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We saw the marches around the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you are their president now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you sense the responsibility to reach out now and to unite them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And for those women, men, children who marched who are watching this, what would you say to them?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I do, but I have to also say: We just had an election a few weeks ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they voted, in many cases, and some cases, they didn't vote, I imagine.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And we did have an election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With that being said, absolutely I have responsibility to everybody, including people that didn't vote for  Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Totally.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the Oval Office.,0,0,0,0,0,1
[Voiceover],0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we come back, President Trump takes us into the Oval Office.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What moves you the most about this room?,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Voiceover],0,0,0,0,0,0
The president on what he's changed already here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the letter left by President Obama and the phone call after reading it, when we come back.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Commercial Break],0,0,0,0,0,0
So we're in the Oval Office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the Oval Office.,0,0,0,0,0,1
This is truly one of the great spaces.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I bring people in from General Motors and from Ford and the biggest people, and I bring in the labor leaders, and the people that are in the labor movement.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they walk into this room, and they just want to take it in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They could stand here for an hour just taking it in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What moves you the most about this room?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just the history of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The importance of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What's happened here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I actually put some pictures up that I thought would be great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some of the paintings that I thought would be really appropriate, George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, who a lot of people, they compare the campaign of Trump with, the campaign of -- you have to go back to 1828, but that seems to be a comparison for, you know, certain obvious reasons.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But we put some of these up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're standing on -- we're standing on Ronald Reagan's rug?,0,0,0,0,0,0
This was Ronald Reagan's.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you have a choice, you know, when you come in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They have eight or nine carpets.,0,0,1,0,0,1
They have different furniture.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The desk is...,0,0,0,0,0,0
The resolute desk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's the resolute desk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is actually very nice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is actually a couple of things that are interesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This was given to me by one of the combatants that I fought to get here, and Adams versus Jefferson, and this book, they say this was the most vicious campaign ever fought for president until this.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Who gave this to you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Somebody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A combatant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And this was the letter given to me by President Obama.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We saw that image of him the final morning that he was here putting the letter on the desk.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Which was -- I won't show it to you or read it to you.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But a -- just a beautiful letter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is there a line you can share that struck you most?,0,0,0,0,0,0
There were numerous lines.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So well-written.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So thoughtful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So thoughtful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in the drawer, you know, put in the drawer, which is a custom, but I doubt too many of them were written in this manner.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"He really -- in fact, I called him and thanked him for the thought that was put into that letter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have to say, I have looked at a lot of those presidential letters that they have left for the next president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That one looks a lot longer than the ones that I have seen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was long, it was complex, it was thoughtful, and it took time to do it, and I appreciated it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I called him and thanked him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Was there something he said in that letter that surprised you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think nothing that surprised me, but it was stated beautifully.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But -- and I'm representing a lot of people, and I'm carrying on a very important tradition, and just do a great job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He wants me to do a great job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He said something that was very interesting to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said, you know, if I thought your health care plan was going to be better than his plan, Obamacare, I would support it, and I believe he would.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe he would.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What was that car ride like to the Capitol, when you got into the car with the president who was about to leave, and you were about to...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The amazing thing to me -- and he may say differently -- is that we I think have sort of a great relationship, and yet it was a vicious campaign, and vicious things were said by him and by me about each other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, he said that, you know, I would never represent the Republican Party.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Then, I won, that I will never win.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I said vicious things about him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was a very -- you know, you talk about Jefferson and Adams.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This was rough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Hillary had a great asset on her side, him and Michelle, who is a phenomenal person.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Hillary had these two people that were really campaigning, big league.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"In fact, I was going out and campaigning -- you know, really complaining about it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I was saying, not really fair.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But to have that kind of vitriol, to have that kind of stuff going on, and then we're riding in a car together up Pennsylvania Avenue, and I'm saying to myself -- I actually said to him, This is a little weird",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we really -- we didn't discuss the negative.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We only discussed the future and the positive.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we really got along well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, again, he may say differently, but I don't think he would.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We really got along well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, you bring up Hillary Clinton.",0,1,0,0,0,0
You had her stand up at Statuary Hall and said some very kind things about her.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She fought hard.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She fought hard.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think America is done hearing about investigations into Hillary Clinton?,0,0,0,1,0,0
I just don't know.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I mean, I hope so.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"From my standpoint, we want to move onto the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I hope so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't know what the status of that is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I know it's a lot of very serious stuff, but I certainly hope so.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have seen the amount of action at this desk already this week.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Dow hit 20,000 today.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm very proud of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Very proud of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The business community and the labor community, you saw that with the labor leaders that came out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of them said it was the single greatest meeting I've ever had with anybody, it's the highlight of my life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the Dow on top of it just hit 20,000.",0,0,1,0,1,1
First time in history.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I'm very proud of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, we have to go up, up, up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't want it to stay there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's the challenge, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's going to be the challenge, but it's gone up a lot since I won.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Don't forget, when I won, people thought, oh, maybe it will go down.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But the business world doesn't think that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The business world knows me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They don't think that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And it was a steady climb.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And now we just hit a record and a number that's never been hit before.,0,0,1,0,1,0
So I was very honored by that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Voiceover],0,0,0,0,0,0
The president then takes us through the West Wing to show us the photos they already have on the walls.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, these are some of the pictures that were taken.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the swearing in and the first dance with Melania.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here's a picture of the crowd.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, the audience was the biggest ever.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But this crowd was massive.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Look how far back it goes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This crowd was massive.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I would actually take that camera and take your time, if you want to know the truth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do want to ask you, Mr. President, about this photo right here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I saw this moment on Inauguration Day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I saw you put your hand on President Obama's back there, as he boarded Executive One, no longer Marine One.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What did you say to him?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I saw you smiling.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is a warmth -- look, if you see that picture, there is a warmth there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that was an incredibly beautiful moment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I've seen it over the years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've seen the good and the bad.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, right now, she is just getting settled, moved to Washington.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Her husband, Jared, very, very smart.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Good guy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We know he'll have a role.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has an office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right, he does.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And he has an office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll have to see what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She is a special person.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're not ruling it out?,0,0,0,1,0,0
She's smart and she's got every quality you could possibly have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't rule out anything.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"No, there's certainly a possibility.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And just before we leave, the president tells us he wants to show us just one more image.",0,0,0,0,0,0
One thing this shows is how far over they go here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Look how far this is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This goes all the way down here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All the way down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody sees that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You don't see that in the pictures.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"It's really something special, that all these people traveled here from all parts of the country, maybe the world, but all parts of the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then I'll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"By coin toss, it's been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have an enthusiastic audience tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0

(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentlemen, welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to start with the topic of presidential leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment's notice?",0,0,0,0,0,0

She made history by protesting school segregation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She believed our nation was stronger together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why I'm so proud to be her running mate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It'll be whether we can make somebody's life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer -- it's going to be about results.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she said to me, you've been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You've been a city councilman and mayor.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You've been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people's lives.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan.",0,0,1,1,1,1

"My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more.",0,0,0,0,1,1
The Trump plan is a different plan.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"It's a ""you're fired"" plan.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And there's two key elements to it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, Donald Trump said wages are too high.",1,1,1,1,1,1
And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession -- the deepest recession since the 1930s.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs.,0,1,1,1,1,1
The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs.,0,1,1,0,1,1
And Donald Trump -- why would he do this?,0,0,0,1,0,0
Because his tax plan basically helps him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump's 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Does that seem fair to you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the ""you're hired,"" ""you're fired"" thing, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You use that a whole lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, what -- what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government.",0,0,0,1,1,1

"I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch.",1,0,1,1,1,1

It's not more spending...,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am interested to hear whether he'll defend his running mate's not releasing taxes and not paying taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0

And he did it brilliantly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How do you know that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You haven't seen his tax returns.,0,0,0,0,0,1
He created a runway -- because he's created a business that's worth billions of dollars today.,0,0,1,0,1,1
How do you know that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn't pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs.",0,0,1,1,1,1

"Elaine, I think that's a very fair comment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we put a lot on police shoulders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States.",0,0,1,0,1,1

"For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Here's what I learned as a mayor and a governor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don't work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country.,0,0,0,0,1,0
That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So here's what we'll do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll focus on community policing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We will focus on -- and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States.",0,0,0,0,1,1

I'm a strong Second Amendment supporter.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And that really has got to stop.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith -- Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy.",0,0,1,1,0,1

We -- we grieve with those who grieve.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I just think...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can I -- can I explain...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We ought to assure the public that we'll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there's a loss of life because of police action.,0,0,0,0,0,0

You've got to pick your choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's our proposal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents.",0,0,1,1,1,1

"So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's another 4.5 million people.,0,0,0,0,1,1

"He wouldn't -- he wouldn't support -- this is important, Elaine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When a guy running for president will not support the troops, not support veterans, not support teachers, that's really important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I said about Aleppo, we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern Syria.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's very important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Pence, you had mentioned no-fly zone.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Where would you propose setting up a safe zone specifically?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How would you keep it safe?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump supports our troops.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump supports our veterans.,0,0,0,0,1,0
He won't pay taxes.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Donald Trump has paid all the taxes that he's -- do you not take deductions?,0,0,0,0,1,1
How does that work?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentlemen, this is about Syria.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Honestly, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Honestly, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is about our troops.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is about our troops.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I understand why you want to change -- I understand why you want to change the subject.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How can you support the troops if you won't pay taxes?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I understand why you want to change the subject.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And let me be very clear on this Russian thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The larger question here...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentlemen, we're going to have time to get to Russia here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What we're dealing with is the -- you know, there's an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we're not having talks anymore.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"To answer your question, we just need American strength.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need to -- we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm's way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And exactly how would those safe zones work?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How would they remain safe?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The -- the safe zones would have to be -- as the senator said, there's already a framework for this that's been recognized by the international community.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"The United States of America needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas, including with a no-fly zone.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, look, this is very tough stuff.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me -- let me come back...",0,0,0,0,0,0
is deeply troubling to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That will all change the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"and talk about -- let me talk about the things that Governor Pence doesn't want to acknowledge, Elaine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He doesn't want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program.,0,0,1,1,1,1
He doesn't want to acknowledge...,0,0,0,0,0,0
We didn't.,0,0,0,0,1,0
that Hillary was part of a team that got bin Laden.,0,0,1,0,1,0
He doesn't want to acknowledge...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"that it's a good thing, not a bad thing, that it's a good thing -- not a bad thing -- that we're down from 175,000 troops deployed overseas to 15,000.",0,0,0,0,1,1
But let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Donald Trump's idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s.,0,0,0,1,0,1
He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And I think that's who Governor Pence's running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And come on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that -- that's pretty low.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But do you -- do you think -- do you think we should have -- more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Senator, the...",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what Donald Trump thinks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence...,0,0,0,0,0,1
But can you defend Donald Trump's claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons?,0,0,0,1,0,0
and assurance to our allies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me go back to this Iran thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, he keeps saying that they prevented -- that Hillary Clinton started the deal with the Iranians prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.",0,0,0,1,1,1
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what the Israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that's not what -- that's not what Israel thinks.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Gadi Eizenkot, you can go check it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You wouldn't necessarily know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go to the tape.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know you boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech when he came before the Congress.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"No, I visited him in his office.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I visited him in his office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You boycotted the speech.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"The point is, what this Iran -- so-called Iran deal did was essentially guarantee -- I mean, when I was in Congress, I fought hard on a bipartisan basis with Republican and Democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions, it -- literally in the history of the United States, against Iran.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And then Hillary used them to get a deal.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"We were bringing them to heel, but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if Iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Elaine, let me just mention one thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"They have not -- Elaine, let me finish a sentence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They have not renounced their nuclear ambitions.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"And when the deal's period runs out, there's no limitation on them obtaining weapons.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And very quickly, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Elaine...,0,0,0,0,0,0
and the fact that they got $1.7 billion in a ransom payment...,0,0,1,1,1,1
We need to talk about Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Very quickly, though, Senator, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
is astonishing to the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can't imagine how you can defend your running mate's position on one issue after the next.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in all six cases, he's refused to defend his running mate.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"Well, let's -- no, no, don't put words in my mouth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's going...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And I just think that should be underlined.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I'm -- look...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, gentlemen, let's talk about Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a topic that has come up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm very, very happy to defend Donald Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If he wants to take these one at a time, I'll take them one at a time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will give you an opportunity to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
More nations should get nuclear weapons.,1,0,1,0,0,1
Try to defend that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Don't put words in my mouth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, he never said that, Senator.",1,0,1,1,1,0
He absolutely said it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Most of the stuffy you've said, he's never said.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Gentlemen, Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and has provided crucial military support to the Assad regime.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"What steps, if any, would your administration take to counter these actions?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Kaine?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've got to be tough on Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So let's start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he's a great leader.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And Donald Trump has business...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, we haven't.",0,0,0,0,1,0
has business dealings -- has business dealings with Russia that he refuses to disclose.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to- toe with Russia.,0,0,1,0,1,0
She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile.,0,0,1,0,1,1
She's had the experience doing it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"And we've done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we've put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Donald Trump, on the other hand, didn't know that Russia had invaded the Crimea.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Oh, that's nonsense.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He was on a TV show a couple months back, and he said, ""I'll guarantee you this, Russia's not going into the Ukraine.""",0,0,0,1,0,1
And he had to be reminded that they had gone into the Crimea two years before.,0,0,0,0,1,1
He knew that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia to work out a deal on New START.,0,0,1,0,1,1
She got them engaged on a meaningful way to cap Iran's nuclear weapons program.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And yet she stood up to them on issues such as Syria and their invasion of Georgia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You've got to have the ability to do that, and Hillary does.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the other hand, in Donald Trump, you have somebody who praises Vladimir Putin all the time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"America should really wonder about a President Trump, who had a campaign manager with ties to Putin, pro- Putin elements in the Ukraine, who had to be fired for that reason.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"They should wonder -- when Donald Trump is sitting down with Vladimir Putin, is it going to be America's bottom line or is it going to be Donald Trump's bottom line that he's going to be worried about with all of his business dealings?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, this could be solved if Donald Trump would be willing to release his tax returns, as he told the American public that he would do.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I know he's laughing at this, but every president...",0,0,0,0,0,0
But what's it got to do with Russia?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Every president since Richard Nixon has done it, and Donald Trump has said I'm doing business with Russia.",0,0,0,0,1,1
The only way the American public will see whether he has a conflict of interest...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, he hasn't said that.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"He has, actually.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, your time is up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, thanks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm just trying to keep up with the insult-driven campaign on the other side of the table.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I'm just saying facts about your running mate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I know you can't defend.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the governor's two minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm happy to defend him, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Don't put words in my mouth that I'm not defending him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm happy to defend him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Most of what you said is completely false, and the American people know that.",0,0,0,1,1,1
I'll run through the list of things where you won't defend...,0,0,0,0,0,0
This isn't the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is Governor Pence's two minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, this is the alternative universe of Washington, D.C., versus reality.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Hillary Clinton said her number-one priority was a reset with Russia.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"That reset resulted in the invasion of Ukraine, after they'd infiltrated with what are called little green men, Russian soldiers that were dressing up like Ukrainian dissidents, and then they moved all the way into Crimea, took over the Crimean Peninsula.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Donald Trump knew that happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He basically was saying it's not going to happen again.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had -- increased its influence in Iran, that's now -- now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear -- the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that -- Syria is imploding.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo.,0,0,0,0,0,0
ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"It is -- ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier -- I get all that -- in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day...",0,0,0,0,0,0
We even wiped out the leader of Al Qaida.,0,0,1,0,1,0
on the day that Iran released four American hostages...,0,0,1,1,1,1
We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons.,0,0,1,1,1,0
Governor...,0,0,0,0,0,0
we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.,1,0,1,1,1,1
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, yesterday, Mr. Trump said...",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"quote, ""Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton and no respect for Obama.""",0,0,1,1,0,0
Why do you think he'll respect a Trump- Pence administration?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Strength.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Plain and simple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Business dealings.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump -- that's nonsense.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Donald Trump is a strong leader...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump's son says that the Trump organization...,0,0,0,1,0,0
who is going to lead with American strength.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Please, Senator, I'll give you a chance to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to rebuild our military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And let me -- let me -- this whole Putin thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, America is stronger than Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Our economy is 16 times larger than the Russian economy.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"America's political system is superior to the crony, corrupt capitalist system in Russia in every way.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"When Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts.",0,0,1,1,1,1
That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin.,0,0,0,1,0,0
That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Kaine?,0,0,0,0,0,0
of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.",0,1,1,0,1,1
That is absolutely inaccurate.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And -- and -- and I just think a guy who praises...,0,0,0,0,0,0
He said he's stronger -- he's been stronger on the world stage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, he said leader.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"And if -- and I'll just say this, Governor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You just said better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you mistake leadership for dictatorship, and you can't tell the difference, a country that's running its economy into the ground...",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Yeah, here we go.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the grade school thing again?,0,0,0,0,0,0
persecuting journalists...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right, this is grade school.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"if you can't tell the difference, you shouldn't be commander-in-chief.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And with Donald Trump -- Donald Trump's sons say that they have all these business dealings with Russia.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Those could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America's bottom line or his own bottom line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Kaine, what went wrong with the Russia reset?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Vladimir Putin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Vladimir Putin is a dictator.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And what would do you differently?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Vladimir Putin is a dictator.,0,0,0,0,0,1
He's not a leader.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Anybody who thinks otherwise doesn't know Russian history and they don't know Vladimir Putin.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Hillary Clinton knows exactly who this guy is.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"John McCain said, I look in his eyes and I see KGB.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And Hillary kind of has that same feeling.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So how do deal with him?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've got to -- we do have to deal with Russia in a lot of different ways.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are areas where we can cooperate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So it was Hillary Clinton who worked with Russia on the New START Treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile.,0,0,1,1,1,1
It was Hillary Clinton that worked with Russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons without firing a shot.,0,0,0,1,1,1
She's not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a very challenging part of the world, and we ought to have a commander-in-chief who is prepared and done it, rather than somebody who goes around praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, I'd like to ask now about North Korea, Iran and the threat of nuclear weapons.",0,0,0,1,0,0
North Korea recently conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What specific steps would you take to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States?,0,0,0,1,0,0
Governor Pence?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first, we need to -- we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military, including modernizing our nuclear forces.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we also need -- we also need an effective American diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the Asian Pacific Rim to put pressure on North Korea, on Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"It has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we're -- we're not going to have the -- the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power.",0,0,0,1,1,1
We're going to -- we're going to go back to the days of peace through strength.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I have to tell you that -- that all this talk about tax returns -- and I get it, you know, you want to keep bringing that up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It must have -- must have...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Until he...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
done well in some focus group.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But here -- Hillary Clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the Clinton Foundation.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"While she was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process.",0,0,0,1,0,1
They cannot make financial contributions.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"When you talk about all these -- all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton -- you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning -- the reason...",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Governor, your two minutes are up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
the reason the American people don't trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server...,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Governor, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
while she's secretary of state.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your two minutes are up, Governor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they're saying enough is enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Kaine?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to talk about the foundation, and then I'll talk about North Korea.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, on the foundation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I am glad to talk about the foundation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people.,1,0,0,0,1,1
It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does.,0,0,1,0,1,1
The Clinton foundation does an awful lot of good work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States.",0,0,0,1,1,1
So the foundation does good work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But let's compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns.,0,0,1,1,0,1
He's refused to do it.,0,0,0,1,1,0

"And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"It's putting money into Donald Trump's pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary.",0,0,0,1,1,1
The Trump Foundation is non-profit.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"In addition, Donald Trump has a foundation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University.,0,0,1,1,1,1
This is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won't share with the American public what he's doing and what those conflicts are.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Governor, I will give you 30 seconds to respond, because I know you want to, but, again, I would remind you both this was about North Korea.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, Thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Trump Foundation is a private family foundation.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Political contributions?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Less than ten cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.,0,0,1,1,1,1

Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.,1,1,1,0,1,1

"All right, let's turn back to North Korea...",0,0,0,0,0,0
that she refused to turn over in her private server...,0,0,0,1,1,0
Senator Kaine...,0,0,0,0,0,0
and we'd have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Kaine, if you had intelligence that North Korea was about to launch a missile, a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States, would you take preemptive action?",0,0,0,1,0,1
"If we -- look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have to.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A president has to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this -- virtually the same package.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"They're starting to get worried about North Korea, too.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"So we're working together with China, and we need to.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"China's another one of those relationships where it's competitive, it's also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Hillary understands that very well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, ""Women's rights are human rights.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They didn't want her to say that, but she did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But she's also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And that's what it's going to take.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China.",0,0,1,1,1,1
I'm not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to turn to our next segment now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in this, I'd like to focus on social issues.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Kaine?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, that's an easy one for me, Elaine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's an easy one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm really fortunate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My mom and dad are sitting right here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My 40th reunion is in 10 days.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"For me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And so I had to grapple with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you elect me, I will uphold the law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I was elected, and I did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn't feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That was a real struggle.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don't feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor Pence?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it's a wonderful question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I've tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And with my wife at my side, we've followed a calling into public service, where we've -- we've tried to -- we've tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and -- and -- and -- I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine's sincere faith.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I truly do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's shared.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives.",0,0,0,0,1,0
I'm also very pleased at the fact we're well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"I think if you're going to be pro-life, you should -- you should be pro- adoption.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion.,0,1,0,0,1,0
"I mean, to hold to the view -- and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally -- but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I cannot -- I can't conscience about -- about a party that supports that.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Or that -- I know you've historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion.,0,0,0,1,1,1
But Hillary Clinton wants to -- wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn't use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"So for me, my faith informs my life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I try and spend a little time on my knees every day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So let's talk about abortion and choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's talk about them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We support Roe v. Wade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's something we trust American women to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we don't think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade.,0,0,1,1,1,1
He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And we have some young people in the audience who weren't even born when Roe was decided.,0,0,0,0,0,1
This is pretty important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.",0,0,1,1,1,1
I think you should live your moral values.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.,1,0,1,1,0,0
"No, it's really not.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Then why did Donald Trump say that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We just never would.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why did he say that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, look, it's -- look, he's not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And so...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I would admit that's not a polished...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, things don't always come out exactly the way he means them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, can I say...",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm telling you what the policy of our administration would be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Great line from the -- great line from the gospel of Matthew.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals...,0,0,0,1,1,0
I'm telling you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, you've whipped out that Mexican thing again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He -- look...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you defend it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives.",0,0,0,1,1,1
You want to -- you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
He also said and many of them are good people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You keep leaving that out of your quote.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you want me to go there, I'll go there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But here's -- there is a choice, and it is a choice on life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I couldn't be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who's standing for the right to life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's a principle that -- Senator Kaine -- and I'm very gentle about this, because I really do respect you -- it's a principle that you embrace.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I have appreciated the fact that you've supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that's not Hillary Clinton's view.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"People need to understand, we can come together as a nation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We can create a culture of life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are -- we're better for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can -- like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast...,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is important --,0,0,0,0,0,0
bring the -- let's welcome the children into our world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are so many families around the country who can't have children.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We could improve adoption...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, Governor...",0,0,0,0,0,0
so that families that can't have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, why don't you trust women to make this choice for themselves?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We can encourage people to support life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course we can.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But why don't you trust women?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why doesn't Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what we ought to be doing in public life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because there are...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"but on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because there is -- a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I believe it with all my heart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I couldn't be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do have one final question for you both tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It has been a divisive campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Kaine, if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you?",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's a really important one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"And again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump -- and this is -- this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he can't defend Donald Trump -- Donald Trump has run a campaign that's been about one insult after the next.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But we do have to bring the country together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So here's what we'll do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I served in the Senate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'm really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She was on the Armed Services Committee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She was on other committees.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana.",1,0,1,0,1,1
She worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"She worked to get benefits for -- TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard.",0,0,0,0,1,1
She has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I think it's fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, how will you unify the country if you win?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a very challenging time in the life of our nation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Weakened America's place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it's going to take leadership to do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They want to see an American comeback.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And Donald Trump's entire career has been about building.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It's been about -- it's going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and -- when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we're going to have a stronger America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They're going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we'll have the kind of unity that's been missing for way too long.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, gentlemen, thank you so much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This concludes the vice presidential debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Our viewers should know that we have lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up.,0,0,0,0,0,1

We had no treaties at risk.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We had no Americans at risk.,0,0,1,0,0,0
There was no threat of attack or imminent attack.,0,0,0,1,0,0

"I — well, I — I would leave his ultimate judgment to the legal system.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Here's what I do believe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a serious problem in terms of the collection of personal information in this country.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And one of the things that I did during the FISA bill in 2007, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was introduce with Russ Feingold two amendments basically saying, ""We understand the realities of how you have to collect this broad information in the Internet age, but after a certain period of time, you need to destroy the personal information that you have if people have not been brought — if criminal justice proceedings have not been brought against them.""",0,0,0,1,1,1
We've got a vast data bank of information that is ripe for people with bad intentions to be able to use.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they need to be destroyed.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Another — another question for each of you, starting with Governor Chafee.",0,0,0,0,0,0

They quickly join the other side.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We bombed the...,0,0,0,0,1,0
[ crosstalk ],0,0,0,0,0,0
President Obama's generals right now are suggesting keeping troops in Afghanistan after the time he wanted them pulled out.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Would you keep them there?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to finish my question — my answer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And also we just bombed a hospital.,0,0,1,0,1,0
We've had drone strikes that hit civilian weddings.,0,0,1,0,1,0
So I would change how we — our approach to the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need a new paradigm in the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor O'Malley, how would you be different than President Obama's administration?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would follow through on the promise that the American people thought we made as Democratic Party, to protect the Main Street economy from recklessness on Wall Street.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would push to separate out these too-big-to-jail, too-big-to-fail banks, and put in place Glass-Steagall, a modern Glass-Steagall that creates a firewall so that this wreckage of our economy can never happen again.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, how would you not be a third term of President Obama?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think that's pretty obvious.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we've had up until this point, including President Obama.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Is there a policy difference?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, there's a lot that I would like to do to build on the successes of President Obama, but also, as I'm laying out, to go beyond.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I have a lot of respect for president Obama.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have worked with him time and time again on many, many issues.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But here's where I do disagree.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe that the power of corporate America, the power of Wall Street, the power of the drug companies, the power of the corporate media is so great that the only way we really transform America and do the things that the middle class and working class desperately need is through a political revolution when millions of people begin to come together and stand up and say: Our government is going to work for all of us, not just a handful of billionaires.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Webb, how would you not be a third term for Obama?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I got a great deal of admiration and affection for Senator Sanders, but I — Bernie, I don't think the revolution's going to come.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I don't think the Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if there would be a major difference between my administration and the Obama administration, it would be in the use of executive authority.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I came up as a committee counsel in the Congress, used to put dozens of bills through the House floor every year as a committee counsel on the Veterans Committee.",0,0,1,0,1,1
I have a very strong feeling about how our federal system works and how we need to lead and energize the congressional process instead of allowing these divisions to continue to paralyze what we're doing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I would lead — working with both parties in the Congress and working through them in the traditional way that our Constitution sets (ph).,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, he cited you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't hear a lot of Democratic presidential candidates talking about revolution.,0,0,0,0,0,1
What do you mean?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I mean is that we need to have one of the larger voter turnouts in the world, not one of the lowest.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We need to raise public consciousness.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need the American people to know what's going on in Washington in a way that today they do not know.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Anderson, I actually have talked about a revolution.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What we need is a green energy revolution.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Why should Democrats embrace an insider like yourself?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I'm running because I have a lifetime of experience in getting results and fighting for people, fighting for kids, for women, for families, fighting to even the odds.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I know what it takes to get things done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know how to find common ground and I know how to stand my ground.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we're going to need both of those in Washington to get anything that we're talking about up here accomplished.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I'm very happy that I have both the commitment of a lifetime and the experience of a lifetime to bring together to offer the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor O'Malley, do you want to tell Secretary Clinton why she shouldn't get the crown?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, actually, you know, we had this conversation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will share with you that I've traveled all around the country, Anderson, and there's two phrases I keep hearing again and again and again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they're the phrases ""new leadership"" and ""getting things done.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We cannot be this dissatisfied with our gridlocked national politics and an economy where 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago, and think that a resort to old names is going to move us forward.",0,0,0,1,1,1
I respect what Secretary Clinton and her husband have done for our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But our country needs new leadership to move forward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, you have to be able to respond, if you want.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I would not ask anyone to vote for me based on my last name.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I would ask them to listen to what I'm proposing, look at what I've accomplished in the Senate, as secretary of of state, and then draw your own conclusion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I certainly am not campaigning to become president because my last name is Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm campaigning because I think I have the right combination of what the country needs, at this point, and I think I can take the fight to the Republicans, because we cannot afford a Republican to succeed Barack Obama as president of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Let's talk about Iran, your assessment, do you think we are on a collision course we being the United States with that country?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it was the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I think it was deal that should have never been negotiated.,0,0,0,1,0,0
The nuclear deal?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The deal that was made by the Obama administration, I think it's a shame that we've had a deal like that and that we had to sign a deal like that and there was no reason to do it.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And if you're going to do it have a good deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Kerry who was negotiating it never once left the table.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We have the worst of everything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've already given them billions and billions, probably hundred $50 billion.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"We gave them $1.7 billion in cash, which is unheard of.",1,0,1,1,1,1
And we put the money out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have really nothing to show for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Possibly you'll tear it up?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We will see what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we'll going to see what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I can say this, they had total disregard for our country.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"They are the number one terrorist state, they're sending money all over the place and weapons, and can't do that.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Sanctions, that's how you're going to start with them?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Just started.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you're going to move in a carrier, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we're just started with sanctions.",0,0,0,0,1,0
I never talked about military moves.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I always criticize President Obama with having an announcement that they're going into Mosul, they're going to some place.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they give the name, the date, the time.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I don't believe in that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We will -- let's see what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I don't like to talk about what we do militarily.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, you're not real bullish on Iran at this point.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"No, I'm not bullish.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's like they're emboldened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They follow our planes, they circle our ships with their little boats, and they scream things at us.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It is what happened -- it's not good.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You would thought what the deal they made, which was a great deal for them and a horrible deal for us, that they would have had a warmth toward our country, and it's exactly the opposite.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They lost respect because they can't believe anybody could be so stupid as to make a deal like that.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Let's talk about Mexico.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There was a report that you talk to President Nieto, and you told him that this was the report.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I want to know if it's true or not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That if his arm he couldn't handle the drug cartels, that U.S. army soldiers would.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Did you say that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to do something about the cartels, I did talk to him about it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to help him with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think he is a very good man.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have a very good relationship, as you probably know.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We will going to have a wall, we will going to have a border.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to stop drugs from coming into our country, and if he can handle it, and maybe they can and maybe they can't or maybe he needs help, he seemed very willing to get help from us because he has got a problem and it's a real problem for us.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So, President Nieto of Mexico was open to the possibility of U.S. forces, all right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Helping him combat the drug cartels.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would rather, as a very nice man that he is and somebody I respect, I would rather have him respond to that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you, I certainly offered him help on knocking out the drug cartels because we have got a problem.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"Don't forget those cartels are operating in our country, and they are poisoning the youth of our country.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And by the way, countries all over the work, just so you understand, this is a cartel all over the world, the cartels.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But I certainly would help him if he needed the help here,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At this point, do you consider Mexico a corrupt country?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because this stuff has been going on for decades.,0,0,0,0,0,0
His Mexico corrupt.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Well, it's a country that has got difficulty.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's certainly has done well with us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $60 billion a year.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"That doesn't include drugs, and it doesn't include the border and all the things that are happening on the border.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But it is a country that I have great respect for the people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I love the people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I really like this administration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think he is a good man.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We get along very well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But they have problems controlling aspects of their country.,0,0,0,1,0,0
There is no question about it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And I would say that drugs and the drug cartels number one.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Have you figured out what kind of a tariff you're going to levy on Mexico to pay for the wall?,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, we might not have to do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They want to negotiate a deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to negotiate a deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We will see what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we can always do a tariff or a tax if necessary, and we will do that if necessary.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But if we can make a deal, we assignment of NAFTA, but I am going to put another F in the name NAFTA because right now it's free trade, and I'm going to have it fair trade also because it's not fair.",0,0,0,0,0,1
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are losing, Bill.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We are losing $60 billion a year in trade deficits with Mexico.,0,0,1,1,1,1
We can't do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You talked to Putin last week.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You had a busy week last week.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I had a busy week.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Busy week and a half.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But within 24 hours of you on the phone with the Russian leader, the pro-Russian forces step up the violence in Ukraine.",0,0,0,1,1,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did you take that as an insult?,0,0,0,0,0,0
No I didn't because we don't really know exactly what that is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're pro-forces.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We don't know if they're uncontrollable?,0,0,0,1,0,0
Are they uncontrollable?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That happens also.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to find out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will be surprised, but we will see.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you respect Putin?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do respect him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I respect a lot of people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that doesn't mean I am going to get along with him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's a leader of his country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I say it's better to get along with Russia than not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Will I get along with them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have no idea.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He is a killer though.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Put is a killer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are a lot of killers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think our country is so innocent?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think our country is so innocent?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't know of any government leaders that are killers in America.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Take a look at what we have done too.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've made a lot of mistakes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've been against the war in Iraq from the beginning.,1,0,0,0,1,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mistakes are different then --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A lot of mistakes, okay?",0,0,0,0,0,0
But a lot of people were killed.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"So, a lot of killers around, believe me.",0,0,0,1,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You mentioned ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Can we expect, we the American people, more U.S. military action against ISIS?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You know, I hate to be evasive but --",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, tell me specifically.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't like talking openly about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't like talking openly about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I can say this, ISIS is bad.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They are evil.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They cut off heads of Christians and Muslims and anybody else that gets in their way.,0,0,0,1,1,0
They drown people in steel cages.,0,0,1,1,0,1
This is like not since the medieval times has anything happened like this.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And the previous administration allowed it to happen because we shouldn't have been in Iraq, but we shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"It created a vacuum, ISIS was formed.",0,1,1,0,0,1
I was to take the oil.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"If they would've taken the oil, there would be no ISIS because they used that to --",0,0,1,1,0,1
"If you took the oil, the Iraqi oil, you would have to put in U.S. troops to do that, and then that would have started another round of it.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And you would have made a lot of money with the oil and you would have had assets and to the -- and all of that.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But forget that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's turn to domestic policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
When can Americans expect the tax cuts?,0,0,0,0,0,0
This year?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are working very much right now on the health care package.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Which I think would be -- it is moving along very well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are trying to get our person Dr. Tom price approved, as you know, the Democrats are being purely political reasons.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is terrible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me get you on the record here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"2017, can Americans expect a tax cut?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think so, yes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think before the end of the year, I would like to say yes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can Americans in 2017 expect a new health care plan ruled out by the Trump administration?,0,0,0,0,0,0
This year.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, in the process, and maybe it will take until sometime into next year, but we are certainly going to be in the process.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Very complicated.,0,0,0,1,0,0
ObamaCare is a disaster.,1,0,0,1,0,0
"You have to remember, ObamaCare doesn't work.",1,0,0,1,1,1
"You look at Arizona, 160 percent increase.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"You look at Minnesota, all of these places it's going through the roof.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It doesn't work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But when are you going to have something ready?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to be putting it in very soon.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that yes, I would like to say by the end of the year.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"At least the rudiments, but we should have something within a year into the following year.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, we will have something that is good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Less expensive and really great health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0

They are now voting on whether they should become a sanctuary state.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So, the state of California, led by Governor Jerry Brown is defying you, absolutely defying the President of the United States.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"So, California and the USA are on a collision course.",0,0,0,1,0,0
How do you see it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think it is a ridiculous sanctuary cities as you know.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I am very much opposed to sanctuary cities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They break crime, there are lots of problems.",0,0,0,1,0,0
You do it very well with Kate and all of the other people you talk about on the show that I watch.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will tell you that sanctuary cities are -- they got a lot of problems, and if there is tremendous crime.",1,0,1,0,0,1
A lot of people agree with me.,0,0,0,0,0,0

This isn't just brought up now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"California in many ways is out of control, as you know.",0,0,1,1,0,1

"We will certainly not stand for sanctuary even cities, let alone states.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You mentioned Kate's Law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why do you think the Democratic Party opposes Kate's Law?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It seems so logical.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's so logical.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are many things that are very logical, the tax cuts are logical but the Democrats who want to raise taxes --",0,0,0,1,0,1
But you didn't answer my question.,0,0,0,1,0,0

"They're talented, they're honest as the day is long.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They're great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But there are some terrible dishonest people and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people.,0,0,0,1,0,0
A tremendous disservice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They are very dishonest people.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And they shouldn't use sources.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They should put the name of the person.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You will see stories dry up like you've never seen before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story — and I put myself in your position sometimes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because many of you, you're not part of the story.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you're not part of the story, you know, then you, sort of, know — if you are part of the story, you know what they're saying is true or not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when they make it up — and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election: polls, polls.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The polls.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They come out with these polls and everybody was so surprised.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Actually, a couple polls got it right.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"I must say Los Angeles Times did a great job, shocking because, you know, they did a great job.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we had a couple of others that were right, but generally speaking, I mean, can tell you the network, somebody said a poll came out.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And I say, what network is it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they'll say, a certain — let's not even mention names, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Shall we?,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you have a lot of them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, the Clinton News Network is one.",0,0,0,1,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
Totally.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Honestly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Take a look, honestly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look at polls over the last two years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now you'd think they would fire the pollster, right?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"After years and years of getting battered, but I — who knows, maybe they are just bad at polling or maybe they're not legit, but it's one or the other, look at how inaccurate — look at CBS, look at ABC, also, look at NBC, take a look at some of these polls.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"They're so bad, so inaccurate and what that does is it creates a false narrative.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"It creates like this narrative that is just like we're not going to win, people say, I love Trump, but you know, I'm not feeling great today, he can't win, so I won't go and vote.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I won't go and vote.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It creates a whole false deal.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And we have to fight it, folks, we have to fight it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They're very smart, they're very cunning and they're very dishonest.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So just to conclude, I mean, it's a very sensitive topic and they get upset when we expose their false stories.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"They say that we can't criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment, you know, they always bring up the First Amendment.",0,0,0,0,1,0
[Laughter],0,0,0,0,0,0
And I love the First Amendment; nobody loves it better than me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, who use its more than I do?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the First Amendment gives all of us — it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans, the right to speak our minds freely.",0,0,0,0,1,1
It gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And many of these groups are part the large media corporations that have their own agenda and it's not your agenda and it's not the country's agenda, it's their own agenda.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn't tell the truth.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Doesn't tell the truth.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So just in finishing, I say it doesn't represent the people, it doesn't tell the never will represent the people, and we're going to do something about it because we have to go out and have to speak our minds and we have to be honest.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before.,1,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],1,0,0,0,0,0
I'm here fighting for you and I will continue to fight for you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The victory and the win were something that really was dedicated to a country and people that believe in freedom, security and the rule of law. Our victory...",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
... was a victory and the win for conservative values.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And our victory was a win for everyone who believes it's time to stand up for America, to stand up for the American worker and to stand up for the American flag.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, there we should stand up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Come on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There we should stand up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK. And by the way, we love our flag. By the way, you folks are in here — this place is packed, there are lines that go back six blocks and I tell you that because you won't read about it, OK.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[Laughter],0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there are lines that go back six blocks, there is such love in this country for everything we stand for, you saw that on Election Day.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
And you're going to see it more and more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we're all part of this very historic movement, a movement the likes of which, actually, the world has never seen before.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There's never been anything like this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There's been some movements, but there's never been anything like this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There's been some movements that petered out like Bernie, petered out.",1,0,0,0,0,0
[Laughter],1,0,0,0,0,0
"But it was a little rigged against him, you know, super delegate, super delegate.",1,0,0,1,0,0
"She had so many delegates before the thing even started, I actually said to my people, how does that happen?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Not that I'm a fan of Bernie, but a lot of Bernie people voted for Trump, you know why?",0,0,0,0,1,1
Because he's right on one issue; trade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He was right about trade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our country is being absolutely devastated with bad trade deals.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"So he was right about that, but we got a lot of Bernie support.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So actually, I like Bernie.",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I like Bernie.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm here today to tell you what this movement means for the future of the Republican party and for the future of America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is and what it actually represents.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[Applause, Chanting ""USA""]",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For too long, we've traded away our jobs to other countries.",0,0,1,1,1,1
So terrible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've defended other nations' borders while leaving ours wide open, anybody can come in.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"We're going to build a wall, don't worry about it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're building the wall.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We're building the wall.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"In fact, it's going to start soon.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Way, way, way ahead of schedule.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to start very soon.,0,0,0,0,0,0
General Kelly by the way has done a fantastic job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fantastic job he's done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And remember, we are getting the bad ones out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
These are bad dudes.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"We're getting the bad ones out, OK?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're getting the bad — if you watch these people, it's like gee, that's so sad.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're getting bad people out of this country, people that shouldn't be whether it's drugs or murder or other things.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We're getting bad ones out, those are the ones that go first and I said it from day one.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Basically all I've done is keep my promise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"In the Middle East, we've spent as of four weeks ago, $6 trillion.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Think of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Booing],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, the Middle East is in — I mean, it's not even close, it's in much worse shape than it was 15 years ago.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"If our presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape than we are right now, that I can tell you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
Be a hell of a lot better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We could have rebuilt our country three times with that money.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This is the situation that I inherited.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I inherited a mess, believe me.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We also inherited a failed health care law that threatens our medical system with absolute and total catastrophe.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Now, I've been watching and nobody says it, but Obamacare doesn't work, folks.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"I mean, I could say, I could talk, it doesn't work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And now people are starting to develop a little warm heart, but the people that you're watching, they're not you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They're largely — many of them are the side that lost, you know they lost the election.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"It's like, how many elections do we have to have?",0,0,0,0,0,0
They lost the election.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"But I always say, Obamacare doesn't work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And these same people two years ago and a year ago were complaining about Obamacare.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And the bottom line, we're changing it.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"We're going to make it much better, we're going to make it less expensive.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to make it much better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obamacare covers very few people — and remember, deduct from the number all of the people that had great health care that they loved that was taken away from them — it was taken away from them.",0,0,0,1,1,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Millions of people were very happy with their health care, they had their doctor, they had their plan.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Remember the lie, 28 times.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You could keep your doctor, you could keep your plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Over and over and over again, you heard it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So we're going to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I tell Paul Ryan and all of the folks that we're working with very hard, Dr. Tom Price, very talented guy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I tell them from a purely political standpoint, the single best thing we can do is nothing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let it implode completely, it's already imploding.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You see the carriers are all leaving.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"I mean, it's a disaster.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But two years, don't do anything.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Democrats will come to us and beg for help, they'll beg and it's their problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it's not the right thing to do for the American people, it's not the right thing to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"We inherited a national debt that has doubled in eight years, think of it, $20 trillion, it's doubled.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another.,0,0,1,0,0,1
We don't win anymore.,0,0,1,1,0,0
When was the last time we won?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did we win a war?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Did we win anything?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do we win anything?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to win.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going on win big, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0

We're gonna win.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The era of empty talk is over, it's over.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
Now is the time for action.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So let me tell you about the actions that we're taking right now to deliver on our promise to the American people and on my promise to make America great again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've taken swift and strong action to secure the southern border of the United States and to begin the construction of a great, great border wall.",0,0,0,0,1,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"By doing this, and with the help of our great border police, with the help of ICE, with the help of General Kelly and all of the people that are so passionate about this — our border patrol, I'll tell you what they do, they came and endorsed me, ICE came and endorsed me.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"They never endorsed a presidential candidate before, they might not even be allowed to.",0,0,1,1,1,1
[Laughter],0,0,0,0,0,0
But they were disgusted with what they saw and we'll stop it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll stop the drugs from pouring into our nation and poisoning our youth.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Pouring in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Pouring in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"We get the drugs, they get the money.",0,0,1,0,0,0

No good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
No good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Going to stop.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"By stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless tax dollars, and that's so important because the tax — the dollars we're losing are beyond anything that you can imagine.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And the tax dollars that can be used to rebuild struggling American communities, including our inner cities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
We are also going to save countless American lives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As we speak today, immigration offers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminal aliens and throwing them the hell out of our country.",1,0,1,1,1,1
[Applause],1,0,0,0,0,0
And we will not let them back in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They're not coming back in, folks.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"They do, they're going to have bigger problems than they ever dreamt of.",0,0,0,1,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm also working with the Department of Justice to being reducing violent crime.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I mean, can you believe what's happening in Chicago as an example?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Two days ago, seven people were shot and I believe killed.",0,0,1,1,1,1

We will support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0

I've also followed through on my campaigning promise and withdrawn America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0,0,0,0,1,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
So that we can protect our economic freedom.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're going to make trade deals, but we're going to do one on one, one on one, and if they misbehave, we terminate the deal and then they'll come back and we'll make a better deal.",0,0,0,1,0,1
None of these big quagmire deals that are a disaster.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Just take a look — by the way, take a look at NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever made by any country, having to do with economic development.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It's economy un-development, as far as our country is concerned.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We're preparing to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to save Americans from this crisis, and give them the access to the quality health care they need and deserve.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Do we agree?,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"But can you imagine — I told this story the other day — can you imagine the gentleman — never met him, don't even know the name of this company.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"I actually sort of know it, but I want to get it exactly correct.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Big, big powerful company, they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the pipeline, same thing with the Dakota, different vice.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"They got their approvals, everything, in the case of Dakota, then all of a sudden they couldn't connect it because they had people protesting that never showed up before.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"But with the Keystone — so they spent hundreds of millions of dollars with bloodsucker consultants — you know, sucking the blood out of the company, don't worry, I've used them all my life, OK?",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Don't worry, we're going to get it approved, I'm connected, I'm a lobbyist, don't worry.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Bottom line, Obama didn't sign it, right?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Could be 42,000 jobs, somewhere around there — a lot of jobs.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Didn't sign it.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"A year ago, it was dead, now he's doing anything, calling his wife, hello darling, I'm a little bored, you know that pipeline that has killed us, that has killed our company.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Knock, knock.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. so and so, the Keystone Pipeline sir, out of nowhere has just been approved.",0,0,1,0,1,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, can you imagine the expression?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you know the sad part?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Those same blood sucking consultants that hit them for all the money and failed, they're now going to go back to him and say, did we do a great job; we want more money, right?",0,0,0,1,0,0

[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And not only our economy, crushing our jobs because companies can't hire.",0,0,1,1,1,1
We're going to put the regulation industry out of work and out of business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, I want regulation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to protect our environment, I want regulations for safety, I want all of the regulations that we need and I want them to be so strong and so tough, but we don't need 75 percent of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs, make us non-competitive overseas with other companies from other countries, that we don't need.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But we're going to have regulation.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"President-elect is meeting with Ford, he's meeting with Chrysler, he's meeting with General Motors.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I just wanted to save a little time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Laughter],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because Ford and Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Intel, and so many others are now, because of the election result, making major investments in the United States, expanding production and hiring more workers.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And they're going back to Michigan and they're going back to Ohio and they're going back to Pennsylvania and they're going back to North Carolina and to Florida.,0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0

[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
We're also put nothing a massive budget request for our beloved military.,0,0,1,1,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we will be substantially upgrading all of our military, all of our military, offensive, defensive, everything, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And hopefully, we'll never have to use it, but nobody's gonna mess with us, folks, nobody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
It will be one of the greatest military build-ups in American history.,0,0,0,0,1,1

Sequester.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"By the way, take a look at what's happening in Europe, folks, take a look at what's happening in Europe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I took a lot of heat on Sweden.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Laughter],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then a day later, I said has anybody reported what's going on?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it turned out that they didn't — not too many of them did.,0,0,0,1,1,0
Take a look at what happened in Sweden.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I love Sweden, great country, great people, I love Sweden.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they understand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The people over there understand I'm right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look at what's happening in Sweden.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look at what's happening in Germany.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"He loves the city of lights, he loves Paris.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For years, every year during the summer, he would go to Paris, was automatic with his wife and his family.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Hadn't seen him in a while.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I said, Jim, let me ask you a question, how's Paris doing?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Paris?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't go there anymore, Paris is no longer Paris.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That was four years — four or five years hasn't gone there.,0,0,0,0,0,1
He wouldn't miss it for anything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now he doesn't even think in terms of going there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Take a look at what's happening to our world, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have to be smart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to be smart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can't let it happen to us.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"So let me state this as clearly as I can, we are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.",0,0,0,1,0,0

"We will not be deterred from this course, and in a matter of days, we will be taking brand-new action to protect our people and keep America safe, you will see the action.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And these are great people, these are some great people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We still don't have our Cabinet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I assume we're setting records for that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the only thing good about it is we're setting records.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I love setting records.,0,0,0,0,0,0

But I hate having a Cabinet meeting and I see all these empty seats.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"We're meeting with unions, meeting with law enforcement and we're meeting with leaders from all around where the White House doors used to be totally closed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They were closed, folks.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"You don't realize that, they were closed.",0,0,1,0,1,0
They're now wide open and they're open for people doing business for our country and putting people to work.,0,0,0,0,1,0

We will fix our broken and embarrassing trade deals that are no good.,0,0,0,1,0,0
None of them.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You wonder where did the people come from that negotiated these deals.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Where did they come from?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, they came also from campaign contributions, I must be honest.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They're not as stupid as you think.,0,0,0,1,0,0

We will cut wasteful spending.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We will promote our values.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We will rebuild our inner cities.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Good evening from the campus of Lynn University here in Boca Raton, Florida.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is the fourth and last debate of the 2012 campaign, brought to you by the Commission on Presidential Debates.",0,0,0,0,0,1
This one's on foreign policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The questions are mine, and I have not shared them with the candidates or their aides.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"The audience has taken a vow of silence — no applause, no reaction of any kind except right now when we welcome President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"(Sustained cheers, applause.)",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentlemen, your campaigns have agreed to certain rules and they are simple.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They have asked me to divide the evening into segments.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll pose a question at the beginning of each segment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You will each have two minutes to respond, and then we will have a general discussion until we move to the next segment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Tonight's debate, as both of your know, comes on the 50th anniversary of the night that President Kennedy told the world that the Soviet Union had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba — perhaps the closest we've ever come to nuclear war.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And it is a sobering reminder that every president faces at some point an unexpected threat to our national security from abroad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So let's begin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The first segment is the challenge of a changing Middle East and the new face of terrorism.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to put this into two segments, so you'll have two topic questions within this one segment on that subject.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The first question, and it concerns Libya, the controversy over what happened there continues.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Four Americans are dead, including an American ambassador.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Questions remain.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What happened?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What caused it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Was it spontaneous?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Was it an intelligence failure?,0,0,0,1,0,0
Was it a policy failure?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Was there an attempt to mislead people about what really happened?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Governor Romney, you said this was an example of an American policy in the Middle East that is unraveling before our very eyes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to hear each of you give your thoughts on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Romney, you won the toss.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You go first.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Bob, and thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here, and Mr. President, it's good to be with you again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and it's nice to maybe be funny this time not on purpose.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll see what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(Laughter.),0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world and to America in particular, which is to see a — a complete change in the — the — the structure and the — the environment in the Middle East.",0,0,0,0,0,1
With the Arab Spring came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation and opportunity for greater participation on the part of women and — and public life and in economic life in the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But instead we've seen in nation after nation a number of disturbing events.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course, we see in Syria 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"We see in — in — in Libya an attack apparently by — well, I think we know now by terrorists of some kind against — against our people there, four people dead.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Our hearts and minds go to them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali, by al-Qaida-type individuals.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We have in — in Egypt a Muslim Brotherhood president.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And so what we're seeing is a — a — a pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course, the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And — and we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the president has done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I congratulate him on — on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaida.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But we can't kill our way out of this mess.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're — we're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the — the world of Islam and — and other parts of the world reject this radical violent extremism which is — it's really not on the run.,0,0,0,1,0,0
It's certainly not hiding.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Mr. President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe, and that's what we've done over the last four years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as a consequence, al-Qaida's core leadership has been decimated.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"In addition, we're now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security, and that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened; and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans, and we would bring them to justice, and that's exactly what we're going to do.",0,0,0,0,1,1
But I think it's important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to — without putting troops on the ground, at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq — liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years, got rid of a despot who had killed Americans.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"And as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying, America's our friend.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We stand with them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you know, Governor Romney, I'm glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after al-Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, my strategy's pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to — to kill them, to take them out of the picture.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But my strategy is broader than — than that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's — that's important, of course, but the key that we're going to have to pursue is a — is a pathway to — to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't want another Iraq.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We don't want another Afghanistan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not the right course for us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the — the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these — these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And how we do that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the — the world reject these — these terrorists.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And the answer they came up was this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One, more economic development.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment and that of our friends — we should coordinate it to make sure that we — we push back and give them more economic development.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number two, better education.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number three, gender equality.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number four, the rule of law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to help these nations create civil societies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what's been happening over the last couple years as we watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see al-Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And — and they're throughout many nations of the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It's wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy, but next door, of course, we have Egypt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Libya's 6 million population, Egypt 80 million population.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We want — we want to make sure that we're seeing progress throughout the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With Mali now having North Mali taken over by al-Qaida, with Syria having Assad continuing to — or to kill — to murder his own people, this is a region in tumult.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And of course Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon.,0,0,1,1,1,0
We've got real gaps in the region.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We'll get to that, but let's give the president a chance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Romney, I'm glad that you recognize that al-Qaida's a threat because a few months ago when you were asked, what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia — not al-Qaida, you said Russia.",1,0,0,1,1,1
"And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But, Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq, but just a few weeks ago you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And the — the challenge we have — I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy, but every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong.",0,0,0,1,0,0
You said we should have gone into Iraq despite the fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction.,0,0,1,1,1,1
You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia, despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it.",0,0,1,1,1,1
You've said that first we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan then you said we should.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong but you were also confusing and sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So what — what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And unfortunately, that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength or keeping America safe over the long term.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to add a couple of minutes here to give you a chance to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, of course I don't concur with what the president said about my own record and the things that I've said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They don't happen to be accurate.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But — but I can say this: that we're talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism we're seeing and the rising tide of tumult and — and confusion.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And — and attacking me is not an agenda.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Attacking me is not talking about how we're going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East and take advantage of the opportunity there and stem the tide of this violence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'll respond to a couple of the things you mentioned.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Number one --,0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a geopolitical foe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I said in the same — in the same paragraph, I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have clear eyes on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia or Mr. Putin, and I'm certainly not going to say to him, I'll give you more flexibility after the election.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed, I believe, that there should have been a status of forces agreement.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Did you --,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not true.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"Oh, you didn't — you didn't want a status of forces agreement?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"No, but what I — what I would not have done is left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down.",0,0,0,1,1,0
That certainly would not help us in the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm sorry, you actually — there was a --",0,0,0,0,0,0
Here — here is — here is --,0,0,0,0,0,0
There was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And I concurred in that and said we should have some number of troops that stayed on.,0,0,0,0,1,1
That was something I concurred with.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Governor --,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was your posture.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was my posture as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I thought it should have been 5,000 troops.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Governor --,0,0,0,0,0,0
I thought it should have been more troops.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you — (inaudible).,0,0,0,1,0,0
This is just a few weeks ago.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The answer was, we got no troop (through ?)",0,0,0,1,1,0
whatsoever.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"No, I didn't.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I'm sorry, that's --",0,0,0,0,0,0
You made a major speech.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I indicated — I indicated that you failed to put in place a status of forces agreement at the end of the conflict that --,0,0,0,1,1,1
Governor --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, here's — here's one thing — here's one thing — here's one thing I've learned as commander in chief.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let him have — (inaudible).,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You've got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, you just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just beat these challenges militarily, and so what I've done throughout my presidency and will continue to do, is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts; number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in Israel's security, because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Number three, we do have to make sure that we're protecting religious minorities and women because these countries can't develop unless all the population — not just half of it — is developing.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Number four, we do have to develop their economic — their economic capabilities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we can't continue to do nation building in these regions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Part of American leadership is making sure that we're doing nation building here at home.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me interject the second topic question in this segment about the Middle East and so on, and that is, you both mentioned — alluded to this, and that is Syria.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The war in Syria has now spilled over into Lebanon.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"We have, what, more than a hundred people that were killed there in a bomb.",0,0,1,1,1,1

The war goes on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's still there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Should we reassess our policy and see if we can find a better way to influence events there, or is that even possible?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it's you — you go first, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go.",0,0,0,0,1,0
We've mobilized sanctions against that government.,0,0,1,1,1,0
We have made sure that they are isolated.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have provided humanitarian assistance, and we are helping the opposition organize, and we're particularly interested in making sure that we're mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so everything we're doing, we're doing in consultation with our partners in the region, including Israel, which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria, coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, this — what we're seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that's why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping, that we're not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or our allies in the region.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I am confident that Assad's days are numbered.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what we can't do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Governor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let's step back and talk about what's happening in Syria and how important it is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Secondly, Syria's an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It's their route to the sea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally Israel.",0,0,1,1,1,0
And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number two, seeing a — a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And finally, we don't want to have military involvement there.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We don't want to get drawn into a military conflict.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so the right course for us is working through our partners and with our own resources to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a — in a form of — of — if not government, a form of — of council that can take the lead in Syria, and then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We do need to make sure that they don't have arms that get into the — the wrong hands.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Those arms could be used to hurt us down the road.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies and particularly with — with — with Israel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the Saudis and the Qatari and — and — and the Turks are all very concerned about this.,0,0,0,1,0,1
They're willing to work with us.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the — the — the insurgents there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed are people who will be the responsible parties.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Recognize I believe that Assad must go.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I believe he will go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I believe we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place such that in the years to come we see Syria as a — as a friend and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This — this is a critical opportunity for America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what I'm afraid of is that we've watched over the past year or so first the president saying, well, we'll let the U.N. deal with it, and Assad — excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and — and said, we're going to try — have a cease-fire.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That didn't work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then it looked to the Russians and said, see if you can do something.",0,0,0,0,0,0
we should.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We should be playing the leadership role there, not on the ground with military --",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We are — we playing the leadership role.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We organized the ""Friends of Syria.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
We are mobilizing humanitarian support and support for the opposition.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And we are making sure that that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you know, going back to Libya, because this is an example of — of how we make choices, you know, when we went into Libya and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize, we also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didn't stay there.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And to the governor's credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle.",0,0,0,1,1,0
Imagine if we had pulled out at that point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That — Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden.,0,0,1,1,1,1
And so we were going to make sure that we finished the job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Like, for example, would you put in no-fly zones over Syria?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't — I don't want to have our military involved in — in Syria.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I don't think there's a necessity to put our military in Syria at — at this stage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't anticipate that in the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us — a responsible government, if possible.",0,0,0,0,1,0
And I want to make sure the get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves but also to remove — to remove Assad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of — of our — of our troops.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And this isn't — this isn't going to be necessary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have — with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups.",0,0,0,0,1,1

Some in your administration thought perhaps we should have waited a while on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"No, I don't because I think that America has to stand with democracy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what I've also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, that they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities — and we have put significant pressure on them to make sure they're doing that — to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region.",0,0,0,0,0,1
These countries can't develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They have to abide by their treaty with Israel.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"That is a red line for us, because not only is Israel's security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They have to make sure that they're cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy, because ultimately, what's going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt but also for the world is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Their aspirations are similar to young people's here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They want jobs.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have a — the prospects of a better life in the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so one of the things that we've been doing is — is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to — to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way that's noncorrupt, that's transparent.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"But what is also important for us to understand is — is that for America to be successful in this region, there are some things that we're going to have to do here at home as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And it's very hard for us to project leadership around the world when we're not doing what we need to do here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Romney, I want to hear your response to that, but I would just ask you, would you have stuck with Mubarak?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I believe, as the president indicated and said at the time, that I supported his — his action there.",0,0,0,0,1,0
I felt that — I wish we'd have had a better vision of the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president did, which is these — these freedom voices in the — the streets of Egypt where the people who were speaking of our principles and the — the — President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable, and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Let me — let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East, and even more broadly, because our purpose is to make sure the world is more — is peaceful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We want a peaceful planet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future and not be at war.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's our purpose.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the mantle of — of leadership for promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We didn't ask for it, but it's an honor that we have it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong, and that begins with a strong economy here at home, and unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.",0,0,0,0,0,1

This — we have weakened our economy.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We need a strong economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to have as well a strong military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our military is second to none in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're blessed with terrific soldiers and extraordinary technology and intelligence.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But the idea of a trillion dollars in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that.,0,0,1,1,1,1
We need to have strong allies.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is America's influence greater today than it was four years ago.",0,0,1,0,1,1
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's because we've become weaker on each of those four dimensions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right — perfect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're going to get a chance to respond to that because that's a perfect segue into our next segment, and that is what is America's role in the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is the question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What do each of you see as our role in the world?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I believe, Governor Romney, it's your turn to go first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I — I absolutely believe that America has a — a responsibility and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that — that make the world more peaceful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections, because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They don't vote for war.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So we want to — to promote those principles around the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
America must lead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You can't have 23 million people struggling to get a job.,0,0,0,0,1,1
You — you can't have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down its growth rate.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You can't have kids coming out of college, half of whom can't find a job today, or a job that's commensurate with their college degree.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We have to get our economy going.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And our military — we've got to strengthen our military long- term.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We — we make decisions today in a military that — that will confront challenges we can't imagine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the 2000 debates there was no mention of terrorism, for instance.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And a year later, 9/11 happened.",0,0,0,0,1,1
So we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that means a strong military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will not cut our military budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to also stand by our allies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way did we was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"And then of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when — when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred.",0,0,0,0,0,1
For the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
America remains the one indispensable nation.,0,0,0,0,0,1

And it is stronger now than when I came into office.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger — in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat.",0,0,0,0,1,1
But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's what my plan does: Making sure that we're bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we're creating jobs here, as we've done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas; making sure that we've got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow; doing everything we can to control our own energy.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We've cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we've developed oil and natural gas, but we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020.",0,0,1,0,1,1
That's the kind of leadership that we need to show.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've got to make sure that we reduce our deficit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unfortunately, Governor Romney's plan doesn't do it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We've got to do it in a responsible way, by cutting out spending we don't need but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That way we can invest in the research and technology that's always kept us at the cutting edge.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies.",0,0,0,1,0,0
He's praised George Bush as good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who shows great wisdom and judgment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Romney, wrong and reckless policies?",0,0,0,1,0,0
(Chuckles.),0,0,0,0,0,0
I've got a policy for the future and an agenda for the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take- home pay.",0,0,0,0,0,1

The — the president said by now we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment.,0,1,1,0,1,1
We're 9 million jobs short of that.,0,0,1,0,1,1
I will get America working again and see rising take- home pay again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll do it with five simple steps.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, were going to have North American energy independence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear and our renewables.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Number two, we're going to increase our trade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Trade grows about 12 percent per year.,0,0,1,0,1,1
It doubles about every — every five or — or so years.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We're all focused on China.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Latin America is a huge opportunity for us: time zone, language opportunities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number three, we're going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers union's going to have to go behind.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And then we're going to have to get to a balanced budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can't expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their companies' money and invest in America if they think we're headed to the road to Greece.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And finally, number five, we've got to champion small business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Small business is where — where jobs come from.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.,0,0,1,0,1,1
New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration.,0,0,1,0,1,1
I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses, but Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses' development ranked about 48, I think, out of 50 states, in Massachusetts, because the policies that you're promoting actually don't help small businesses.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And the way you define small businesses include folks at the very top.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They include you and me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not the kind of small business promotion we need.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But — but let's take an example that we know is going to make a difference 21st century, and that's our education policy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, under my leadership, what we've done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We've seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time, and they're starting to finally make progress.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we've fallen behind when it comes to math and science.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And those teachers can make a difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said, this isn't going to help the economy grow.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don't make a difference.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if we've got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, that's what's going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Companies are going to locate here depending on whether we've got the most highly skilled workforce.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And the kinds of budget proposals that you've put forward — when we don't ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, that's undermining our long-term competitiveness.",0,0,0,1,1,1
That is not good for America's position in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the world notices.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me get back to foreign policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well --,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can I just get back --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I need to speak a moment if you'll let me, Bob --",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"— just about education, because I'm — I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have, every two years, tests that look at how well our kids are doing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"While I was governor, I was proud that our fourth graders came out number one of all 50 states in English and then also in math, and our eighth graders number one in English and also in math — first time one state had been number one in all four measures.",0,0,0,0,1,1
How did we do that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And that was --,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ten years earlier --,0,0,0,0,0,1
That was — that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And this is — and we were --,0,0,0,0,0,0
But that was 10 years before you took office.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And we — absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Gentlemen --,0,0,0,0,0,0
And then you cut education spending when you came into office.,0,1,0,0,1,0
The first — the first — and we kept our schools number one in the nation.,0,0,1,0,1,1
They're still number one today.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And the principles that we've put in place — we also gave kids not just a graduation exam that — that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to — to be able to compete, but also, if they graduated in the top quarter of their class, they got a four-year tuition-free ride at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning.",0,0,1,0,1,1
That happened — that happened before you came into office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That was actually mine, actually, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You got that fact wrong.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Let me — I want to try to shift it, because we have heard some of this in the other debates.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, you say you want a bigger military.",0,0,0,0,1,0
You want a bigger Navy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't want to cut defense spending.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"What I want to ask you, we're talking about financial problems in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Where are you going to get the money?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let's — let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way — all the way through.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I'm going through, from the very beginning, we're going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget excluding military.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That's number one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
But can you do this without driving us deeper into debt?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The good news is, I'll be happy to have you take a look.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Come on our website, you'll look at how we get to a balanced budget within eight to 10 years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We do it by getting — by reducing spending in a whole series of programs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"By the way, number one I get rid of is ""Obamacare.""",0,0,0,1,0,0
"There are a number of things that sound good but, frankly, we just can't afford them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that one doesn't sound good, and it's not affordable, so I get rid of that one from day one; to the extent humanly possible, we get that out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We take program after program that we don't absolutely have to have and we get rid of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number two, we take some programs that we are going to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We're — take that health care program for the poor, and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"As a governor, I thought, please, give me this program.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Can he do that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
(Inaudible.),0,0,0,0,0,0
I can run this more efficiently than the federal government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And states, by the way, are proving it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these Medicaid dollars, have shown they can run these programs more cost effectively.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Bob --,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I want to do those two things that gets us — it gets us to a balanced budget with eight in — eight to 10 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Bob --,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the military --,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's go back to the military, though.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that's what I'm trying to find out about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's talk about the military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You should have answered the first question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, Governor Romney's called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says he's going to pay for by closing deductions.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Now, the math doesn't work but he continues to claim that he's going to do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He then wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military's not asking for.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined — China, Russia, France, the United — United Kingdom, you name it, next 10.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And what I did was work with our Joint Chiefs of Staff to think about what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the budget that we've put forward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what you can't do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts, you say that you're going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions without naming what those loopholes and deductions are, and then somehow you're also going to deal with the deficit that we've already got.",1,0,1,1,0,1
The math simply doesn't work.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know, just budgets, we got to think about capabilities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to be thinking about cybersecurity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to be thinking about space.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's exactly what our budget does, but it's driven by strategy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's not driven by politics.,0,0,0,1,1,0
It's not driven by members of Congress and what they would like to see.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It's driven by what are we going to need to keep the American people safe?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's exactly what our budget does.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern because we've got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Bob, I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was in the world of business for 25 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you didn't balance your budget, you went out of business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I went to the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance and made a success there.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I had the chance to be governor of a state.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Four years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We cut taxes 19 times, balanced our budget.",0,0,1,0,1,1
The president hasn't balanced a budget yet.,0,0,1,0,1,1
I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I — I'm going to be able to balance the budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's talk about military spending, and that's this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our Navy --,0,0,0,0,0,0
About 30 seconds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our Navy is older — excuse me — our Navy is smaller now than any time since 1917.,0,0,1,0,1,1
The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We're now down to 285.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We're headed down to the — to the low 200s if we go through with sequestration.,0,1,0,0,0,0
That's unacceptable to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Our Air Force is older and smaller than any time since it was founded in 1947.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We've changed for the first time since FDR.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We — since FDR we had the — we've always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Now we're changing to one conflict.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the president of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is the combination of the budget cuts that the president has as well as the sequestration cuts.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"That, in my view, is — is — is making our future less certain and less secure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I won't do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Bob, I just need to comment on this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, the sequester is not something that I proposed.",0,0,0,0,1,0
It's something that Congress has proposed.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It will not happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The budget that we're talking about is not reducing our military spending.,0,0,0,0,1,0
It's maintaining it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You — you mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets — (laughter) — because the nature of our military's changed.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And so the question is not a game of Battleship where we're counting ships.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's — it's what are our capabilities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so when I sit down with the secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward, because it just don't work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you know, we've visited the website quite a bit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it still doesn't work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot to cover.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd like — (murmurs) — I'd like to move to the next segment: red lines, Israel and Iran.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Would either of you — and you'll have two minutes, and President Obama, you have the first go at this one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Would either of you be willing to declare that an attack on Israel is an attack on the United States, which of course is the same promise that we give to our close allies like Japan?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And if you made such a declaration, would not that deter Iran?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"It's certainly deterred the Soviet Union for a long, long time when we made that — when we made that promise to our allies.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Mr. President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, Israel is a true friend.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is our greatest ally in the region.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I've made that clear throughout my presidency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And --,0,0,0,0,0,0
So you're saying we've already made that declaration?,0,0,0,1,0,0
I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"In fact, this week we'll be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history, this very week.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"But to the issue of Iran, as long as I'm president of the United States, Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.",0,0,0,1,1,1
I've made that clear when I came into office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Their currency has dropped 80 percent.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago.,0,0,1,0,1,1
So their economy is in a shambles.,0,0,1,1,1,0
And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security and it's threat to Israel's national security.,0,0,1,1,0,1
We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Iran's a state sponsor of terrorism, and for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to nonstate actors — that's unacceptable.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map.,0,0,1,1,1,1
So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that during the course of this campaign he's often talked as if we should take premature military action.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"I think that would be a mistake because when I've sent young men and women into harm's way, I always understand that that is the last rest, not the first resort.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Two minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I — I want to underscore the — the same point the president made, which is that if I'm president of the United States, when I'm president of the United States, we will stand with Israel.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"And — and if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's number one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number two, with regards to — to Iran and the threat of Iran, there's no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran, is unacceptable to America.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"It presents a threat not only to our friends, but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"It's also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And crippling sanctions are something I'd called for five years ago when I was in Israel speaking at the Herzliya Conference.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I laid out seven steps.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Crippling sanctions were number one.,0,0,1,1,0,0
And they do work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're seeing it right now in the economy.,0,0,0,0,1,0
It's absolutely the right thing to do to have crippling sanctions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd have put them in place earlier, but it's good that we have them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil can't come into our ports.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I imagine the EU would agree with us as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not only ships couldn't, I'd say companies that are moving their oil can't, people who are trading in their oil can't.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I would tighten those sanctions further.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, I'd take on diplomatic isolation efforts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention.,0,0,1,0,1,1
His words amount to genocide incitation.,0,0,0,1,1,0
I would indict him for it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world, the same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to increase pressure time and time again on Iran because anything other than a — a — a solution to this which says — which stops this nuclear folly of theirs is unacceptable to America.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And of course, a military action is the last resort.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is something one would only, only consider if all of the other avenues had been — had been tried to their full extent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me ask both of you, there — as you know, there are reports that Iran and the United States, as part of an international group, have agreed in principle to talks about Iran's nuclear program.",0,0,0,0,1,1
What is the deal if there are such talks?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What is the deal that you would accept?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, those were reports in the newspaper.",0,0,0,1,0,1
They are not true.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place, because they have the opportunity to re-enter the community of nations, and we would welcome that.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"There are — there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world, for a better life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the deal we'll accept is, they end their nuclear program.",0,0,1,1,1,0
It's very straightforward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you know, I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the some things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that that would make a difference, and it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking; it's meticulous.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We started from the day we got into office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the reason it was so important — and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world — is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China, because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions, we've had sanctions in place for a long time.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've got to maintain that pressure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established; they convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program; there are inspections that are very intrusive.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the meantime, though, we're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And one last thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm — just to make this point: The clock is ticking.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And I've been very clear to them, you know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program, and that clock is ticking.",0,0,0,1,1,1
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration and — and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"And I say that because from the very beginning, the president, in his campaign some four years ago, said he'd meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"He'd — he'd sit down with Chavez and — and Kim Jong-Il, with Castro and with — with President Ahmadinejad of — of Iran.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And — and I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the president of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And then the president began what I've called an apology tour of going to — to various nations in the Middle East and — and criticizing America.,1,0,0,0,1,0
I think they looked at that and saw weakness.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, the Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I think they noticed that as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel that — that they noticed that as well.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here; we can keep talks going on, but we're just going to keep on spinning centrifuges.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to — to create a — a — a --- a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"That's unacceptable for us, and — and — and it's essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They must not develop nuclear capability.,0,0,1,1,0,0
And the way to make sure they understand that is by having from the very beginning the tightest sanctions possible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They need to be tightened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to indict Ahmadinejad.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Bob, let me just respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign, and every fact-checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we've put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And the fact is while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"So I'll let the American people decide, judge who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place, and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And — and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I came into office, the world was divided.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Iran was resurgent.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Iran is at its weakest point economically, strategically, militarily than since — than in many years.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to makes sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's in America's national interest, and that will be the case so long as I'm president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And — and we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they've — they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's number one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to — to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to — to Turkey and Iraq.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And — and by way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel.",0,0,0,1,1,0
And then in those nations and on Arabic TV you said that America had been dismissive and derisive.,0,0,1,1,0,1
You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We have freed other nations from dictators.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Bob, let me — let me respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, if we're going to talk about trips that we've taken, you know, when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors, I didn't attend fundraisers, I went to Yad Vashem, the — the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the — the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And then I went down to the border towns of Sderot, which had experienced missiles raining down from Hamas.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And I saw families there who showed me where missiles had come down near their children's bedrooms, and I was reminded of — of what that would mean if those were my kids, which is why, as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.",0,0,1,0,1,1
So that's how I've used my travels when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the central question at this point is going to be, who's going to be credible to all parties involved?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they can look at my track record — whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities — and they can say that the president of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And — and that kind of credibility is precisely why we've been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What if — what if the prime minister of Israel called you on the phone and said: Our bombers are on the way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to bomb Iran.,0,0,1,1,0,0
What do you say?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Bob, let's not go into hypotheticals of that nature.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way or their fighters are on the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of action.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So you're saying just what --,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm — that's — that's --,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's see what — (inaudible) --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, but let me — let me — let me come back — let's come back — let's come back and go back to what the president was speaking about, which is what's happening in the world and — and — and the president's statement that things are going so well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I — I look at what's happening around the world and I see Iran four years closer to a bomb.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I see jihadists continuing to spread.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whether they're rising or just about the same level hard to — hard to precisely measure, but it's clear they're there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They're very, very strong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power.",0,0,1,1,1,1
I see our trade deficit with China larger than it's — growing larger every year as a matter of fact.,0,0,1,0,1,1
I look around the world and I don't feel that — you see North Korea continuing to export their nuclear technology.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Russia's said they're not going to follow Nunn-Lugar anymore; they're (back ?),0,0,0,1,1,0
away from their nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home, in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military and the way I think it ought to be, in part because of the — the — the turmoil with Israel.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.",0,0,1,1,1,1
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They asked him, please repair the tension — Democrat senators — please repair the damage in his — in his own party.",0,0,0,1,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's Afghanistan, whether it's Iraq, whether it's now Iran, you've been all over the map.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"I mean, I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But just a few years ago you said that's something you'd never do, in the same way that you initially opposed a time table in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends; in the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there; the same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Gadhafi.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any president would make that call.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when you were a candidate in 2008 — as I was — and I said, if I got bin Laden in our sights, I would take that shot, you said we shouldn't move heaven and earth to get one man, and you said we should ask Pakistan for permission.",1,0,1,1,1,0
"And if we had asked Pakistan for permission, we would not have gotten it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, after we killed bin Laden, I was at Ground Zero for a memorial and talked to a — a — a young woman who was 4 years old when 9/11 happened.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the twin towers, saying, Peyton (sp), I love you, and I will always watch over you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And for the next decade she was haunted by that conversation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she said to me, you know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when we do things like that, when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world, and it tells Peyton (sp) that we did not forget her father.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And — and I make that point because that's the kind of clarity of leadership — and those decisions are not always popular.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Those decisions generally are not poll-tested.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what the American people understand is, is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's go — and that leads us — this takes us right to the next segment, Governor, America's longest war, Afghanistan and Pakistan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Bob --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, you get to go first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You can't — you can't — well, OK, but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"With respect, sir, you had laid out quite a program there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that's probably true.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(Chuckles.),0,0,0,0,0,0
And we'll — we'll give you --,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll agree (with that ?,0,0,0,0,0,0
).,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll catch you up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The United States is scheduled to turn over responsibility for security in Afghanistan to the Afghan government in 2014.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"At that point we will withdraw our combat troops, leave a smaller force of Americans, if I understand our policy, in Afghanistan for training purposes.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It seems to me the key question here is what do you do if the deadline arrives and it is obvious the Afghans are unable to handle their security?,0,0,0,1,0,0
Do we still leave?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I believe Governor Romney, it — you go first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we're going to be finished by 2014.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when I'm president, we'll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've seen progress over the past several years.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"The surge has been successful, and the training program is proceeding apace.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"There are now a large number of Afghan security forces, 350,000, that are — are ready to step in to provide security.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And — and we're going to be able to make that transition by the end of — of 2014.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So our troops'll come home at that point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I — I can tell you, at the same time, that — that we will make sure that we — we look at what's happening in Pakistan and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And — and I say that because I know a lot of people just feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the — in our nation feel that Pakistan (doesn't ?)",0,0,0,0,0,0
— being nice to us and that we should just walk away from them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads, and they're rushing to build a lot more.",0,0,0,0,1,1
They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the — in the relatively near future.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They also have the Haqqani network and — and the Taliban existent within their country.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"And so a — a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and us.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And so we're going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a — a more stable government and — and rebuild a relationship with us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that means that — that — that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So for me, I look at this as both a — a — a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction and also to get Afghanistan to be ready.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they will be ready by the end of 2014.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, when I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq, and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we did deliver a surge of troops.,0,0,0,0,1,0
That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Part of what had happened is we'd forgotten why we'd gone.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And so we decimated al-Qaida's core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.,0,0,0,1,1,1
We then started to build up Afghan forces.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, that transition's — has to take place in a responsible fashion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've been there a long time, and we've got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war, it's time to do some nation-building here at home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what we can now do is free up some resources to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I was having lunch with some — a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what we've said is, let's change those certifications.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And as a consequence, veterans' unemployment is actually now lower than general population, it was higher when I came into office.",1,0,1,0,1,1
So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we're making that transition in Afghanistan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me go to Governor Romney because you talked about Pakistan and what needs to be done there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"General Allen, our commander in Afghanistan, says that Americans continue to die at the hands of groups who are supported by Pakistan.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We know that Pakistan has arrested the doctor who helped us catch Obama's — bin Laden.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"It still provides safe haven for terrorists, yet we continue to give Pakistan billions of dollars.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Is it time for us to divorce Pakistan?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, it's not time to divorce a nation on earth that has a hundred nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation — as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani network.",0,0,1,1,1,1
It's a nation that's not like — like others and that does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You've got the ISI, their intelligence organization is probably the most powerful of the — of the three branches there.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Then you have the military and then you have the — the civilian government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a nation which if it falls apart — if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you've got — you've got terrorists there who could grab their — their hands onto those nuclear weapons.",0,0,1,1,1,1
This is — this is an important part of the world for us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Pakistan is — is technically an ally, and they're not acting very much like an ally right now, but we have some work to do.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I — I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We had to go into Pakistan; we had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That was the right thing to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that upset them, but there was obviously a great deal of anger even before that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we're going to have to work with the — with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it's important for them, it's important for the nuclear weapons, it's important for the success of Afghanistan, because inside Pakistan you have a large group of Pashtuns that are — that are Taliban, that they're going to come rushing back into Afghanistan when we go.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And that's one of the reasons the Afghan security forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we do need to make sure that as we — as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on — on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me ask you, Governor, because we know President Obama's position on this, what is — what is your position on the use of drones?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I believe that we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it's widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that entirely and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology and believe that we should continue to use it to continue to go after the people who represent a threat to this nation and to our friends.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Let me also note that, as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and — and killing bad guys, important as that is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're also going to have to have a far more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We haven't done that yet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the — the record.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You look at the record of the last four years and say, is Iran closer to a bomb?",0,0,1,0,0,1
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is the Middle East in tumult?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Is — is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?",0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is — are Israel and the Palestinians closer to — to reaching a peace agreement?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, they haven't had talks in two years.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We've created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism — in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And what we've also done is engage these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their government aren't corrupt, to make sure that they are treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown, and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries and we have stood on the side of democracy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One thing I think Americans should be proud of — when Tunisians began to protest, this nation, me, my administration stood with them earlier than just about any other country.",0,0,0,0,1,0
In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.,0,0,0,0,1,1
In Libya we stood on the side of the people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And as a consequence there is no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And we want to shrink those groups and those networks, and we can do that, but we're always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The truth, though, is that al-Qaida is much weaker than it was when I came into office, and they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Let's go to the next segment because it's a very important one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is the rise of China and future challenges for America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to just begin this by asking both of you — and Mr. President, you go first this time — what do you believe is the greatest future threat to the national security of this country?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We have to remain vigilant, as I just said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But with respect to China, China's both an adversary but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I know Americans had — had seen jobs being shipped overseas, businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And that's the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other — the previous administration had done in two terms.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"And we've won just about every case that we've filed, that — that has been decided.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"In fact, just recently, steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest, Pennsylvania, are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires — or — or — or cheap Chinese tires.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"And we put a stop to it and, as a consequence, saved jobs throughout America.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case, said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But I tell you, those workers don't feel that way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we've also got to make sure, though, that we're taking — taking care of business here at home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we don't have the best education system in the world, if we don't continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to — to create great businesses here in the United States, that's how we lose the competition.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And unfortunately, Governor Romney's budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments.",0,0,0,1,1,1
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not government investments that make businesses grow and hire people.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat, is a nuclear Iran.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Let's talk about China.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"China has an interest that's very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They don't want war.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They don't want to see protectionism.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"They don't want to see the — the world break out into — into various forms of chaos, because they have to — they have to manufacture goods and put people to work.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And they have about 20,000 — 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year, coming into the cities, needing jobs.",0,0,1,0,1,1
So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so we can be a partner with China.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We can work with them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can collaborate with them if they're willing to be responsible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, they look at us and say, is it a good idea to be with America?",0,0,0,0,0,0
How strong are we going to be?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How strong is our economy?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They look at the fact that we owe them a trillion dollars and owe other people 16 trillion (dollars) in total, including them.",0,0,1,1,1,1
They — they look at our — our decision to — to cut back on our military capabilities — a trillion dollars.,0,0,1,1,1,1
The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.,0,0,1,1,1,1
It's not my term.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's the president's own secretary of defense called them devastating.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"They look at America's commitments around the world and they see what's happening and they say, well, OK, is America going to be strong?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And the answer is yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I'm president, America will be very strong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency.",0,0,1,1,1,1
It holds down the prices of their goods.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It means our goods aren't as competitive and we lose jobs.,0,1,0,1,1,1
That's got to end.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're making some progress; they need to make more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why on day one I will label them a currency manipulator which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"They have to understand, we want to trade with them, we want a world that's stable, we like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, Governor, let me just ask you, if you declare them a currency manipulator on day one, some people are saying you're just going to start a trade war with China on day one.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Is that — isn't there a risk that that could happen?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And we sell them about this much stuff every year.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So it's pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there's one going on right now that we don't know about.,0,0,0,0,1,0
It's a silent one and they're winning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have an enormous trade imbalance with China.,0,0,1,0,1,1
And it's worse this year than last year.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And it was worse last year than the year before.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And — and so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and — and lose jobs year in and year out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to say to our friends in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively, we understand it, but — but this can't keep on going.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even into the United States.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I was with one company that makes valves in — in process industries.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And they said, look, we were — we were having some valves coming in that — that were broken, and we had to repair them under warranty.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"And we looked them up, and — and they had our serial number on them.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And then we noticed that — that there was more than one with that same serial number.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging.",0,0,1,1,1,1
These were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor.,0,0,1,1,1,1
This can't go on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want a great relationship with China.,0,0,0,0,0,0
China can be our partner.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But — but that doesn't mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, Governor Romney's right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas, because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"And, you know, that's your right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, that's how our free market works.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I've made a different bet on American workers.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, if we had taken your advice, Governor Romney, about our auto industry, we'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that are in profits overseas don't pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes, now, that's estimated to create 800,000 jobs.",0,0,1,0,1,1
The problem is they won't be here; they'll be in places like China.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the lead in things like clean energy technology.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, with respect to what we've done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled, since I came into office, to China.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And actually, currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We absolutely have to make more progress, and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And we believe China can be a partner, but we're also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power, that we are going to have a presence there.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through, that commerce continues.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And we're organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.,0,0,0,0,1,1
That's the kind of leadership we've shown in the region.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just want to take one of those points.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, attacking me is not talking about an agenda for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nothing could be further from the truth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm a son of Detroit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was born in Detroit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My dad was head of a car company.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I like American cars.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was President Bush that wrote the first checks.,0,0,0,0,1,1
I disagree with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said they need — these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy, and in that process they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd — they'd built up.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And fortunately the president picked --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Romney, that's not what you said.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"Fortunately, the president — you can take — you can take a look at the op-ed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, you did not --",0,0,0,1,0,0
You can take a look at the op-ed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You did not say that you would provide, Governor, help.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"You know, I'm — I'm still speaking.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said that we would provide guarantees and — and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the idea that has been suggested that I would liquidate the industry — of course not.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Of course not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's check the record.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the height of silliness.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's — let's check the record.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have never said I would — I would liquidate the industry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to keep the industry growing and thriving.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, the people in Detroit don't forget.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And — and that's I have the kind of commitment to make sure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We in this country can compete successfully with anyone in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're going to.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to have to have a president, however, that doesn't think that somehow the government investing in — in car companies like Tesla and — and Fisker, making electric battery cars — this is not research, Mr. President.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"These are the government investing in companies, investing in Solyndra.",0,0,0,0,1,1
This is a company.,0,0,0,0,0,1
This isn't basic research.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I — I want to invest in research.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Research is great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Providing funding to universities and think tanks — great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But investing in companies?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the wrong way to go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, the fact of the matter is --",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm still speaking.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well — (chuckles) --,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I want to make sure that we make — we make America more competitive --,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"— and that we do those things that make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses to grow.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But your investing in companies doesn't do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In fact it makes it less likely for them to come here --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, Governor --",0,0,0,0,0,0
— because the private sector's not going to invest in a — in a — in a solar company if --,0,0,0,1,0,1
I'm happy — I'm — I'm — I'm happy to respond --,0,0,0,0,0,0
— if you're investing government money and someone else's.,0,0,0,1,0,0
You've held the floor for a while.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The — look, I think anybody out there can check the record.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know, airbrush history here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You were very clear that you would not provide government assistance to the U.S. auto companies even if they went through bankruptcy.,1,0,0,1,1,1
You said that they could get it in the private marketplace.,0,0,0,0,1,1
That wasn't true.,0,1,0,1,1,0
They would have gone through a --,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're wrong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're wrong, Mr. President.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I — no, I am not wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You're wrong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am not wrong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And --,0,0,0,0,0,0
People can look it up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People will look it up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But more importantly, it is true that in order for us to be competitive, we're going to have to make some smart choices right now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Cutting our education budget — that's not a smart choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That will not help us compete with China.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cutting our investments in research and technology — that's not a smart choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That will not help us compete with China.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Bringing down (sic) our deficit by adding $7 trillion of tax cuts and military spending that our military's not asking for before we even get to the debt that we currently have — that is not going to make us more competitive.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Those are the kinds of choices that the American people face right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Having a tax code that rewards companies that are shipping jobs overseas instead of companies that are investing here in the United States — that will not make us more competitive.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And — and the one thing that I'm absolutely clear about is that after a decade in which we saw drift, jobs being shipped overseas, nobody championing American workers and American businesses, we've now begun to make some real progress.",0,0,1,0,1,1
What we can't do is go back to the same policies that got us into such difficulty in the first place.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And that's why we have to move forward and not go back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The policies of the last four years have seen incomes in America decline every year for middle-income families, now down $4,300 during your term, 23 million Americans still struggling to find a good job.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"When you came into office, 32 million people on food stamps — today 47 million people on food stamps.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"When you came to office, just over $10 trillion in debt — now $16 trillion in debt.",0,0,1,1,1,1
It hasn't worked.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You said by now we'd be at 5.4 percent unemployment.,0,0,1,1,1,1
We're 9 million jobs short of that.,0,0,1,0,1,1
I've met some of those people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I — I met a young woman in — in — in Philadelphia who's coming out of — out of college, can't find work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've been — Ann was with someone just the other day that was just weeping about not being able to get work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours that these last four years have been so hard.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that — and that's why it's so critical that we make America once again the most attractive place in the world to start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's not going to happen by — by just hiring teachers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I — I love to — I love teachers, and I'm happy to have states and communities that want to hire teachers, do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I — by the way, I don't like to have the federal government start pushing its way deeper and deeper into — into our schools.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let the states and localities do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was a governor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The federal government didn't hire our teachers.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Governor --,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I love teachers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to get our private sector growing, and I know how to do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we all love teachers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(Laughter.),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentlemen, thank you so much for a very vigorous debate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have come to the end.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is time for closing statements.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe you're first, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, thank you very much Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, you've now heard three debates, months of campaigning and way too many TV commercials.",0,0,0,1,0,0
(Laughter.),0,0,0,0,0,0
And now you've got a choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, over the last four years, we've made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those policies: a foreign policy that's wrong and reckless; economic policies that won't create jobs, won't reduce our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very top don't have to play by the same rules that you do.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And I've got a different vision for America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to build on our strengths.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here not overseas.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I want to make sure we've got the best education system in the world and we're retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas, but also the energy sources of the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending that we don't need, but also by asking the wealthy to do a little bit more so that we can invest in things like research and technology that are the key to a 21st century economy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"As commander in chief, I will maintain the strongest military in the world, keep faith with our troops and go after those who would do us harm.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But after a decade of war, I think we all recognize we got to do some nation building here at home, rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially caring for our veterans who've sacrificed so much for our freedom.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we've been through tough times, but we always bounce back because of our character, because we pull together.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if I have the privilege of being your president for another four years, I promise you I will always listen to your voices, I will fight for your families and I will work every single day to make sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on earth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Bob, Mr. President, folks at Lynn University — good to be with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm optimistic about the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm excited about our prospects as a nation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to see peace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to see growing peace in this country, it's our objective.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have an opportunity to have real leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
America's going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace that'll make a world the safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I also want to make sure that we get this economy going.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there are two very different paths the country can take.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One is a path represented by the president, which, at the end of four years, would mean we'd have $20 trillion in debt, heading towards Greece.",0,0,1,0,1,1
I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I want to make sure our take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The president's path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job.,0,0,1,0,1,1
I'll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps not by cutting the program but by getting them good jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
America's going to come back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.,0,0,0,0,1,1
I learned how to get along on the other side of the aisle.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to do that in Washington.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Washington is broken.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I know what it takes to get this country back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we'll work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This nation is the hope of the earth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've been blessed by having a nation that's free and prosperous thanks to the contributions of the Greatest Generation.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They've held a torch for the world to see, the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Now it's our turn to take that torch.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm convinced we'll do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need strong leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd like to be that leader, with your support.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll work with you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll lead you in an open and honest way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I ask for your vote.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd like to be the next president of the United States to support and help this great nation, and to make sure that we all together maintain America as the hope of the earth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you so much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentlemen, thank you both so much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That brings an end to this year's debates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we want to thank Lynn University and its students for having us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As I always do at the end of these debates, I leave you with the words of my mom who said, go vote.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It makes you feel big and strong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Good night.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(Inaudible.),0,0,0,0,0,0
Morning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thanks for being here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are now nine away from the inauguration of the next president and vice president of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It's an opportunity to be here today to allow the president-elect to take your questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"After the president-elect makes some remarks, he will introduce Ms. Sheri Dillon, a prominent attorney in Washington, D.C., with the prestigious firm of Morgan Lewis who will -- who structured the agreements pursuant to the president's business arrangements and she will give brief remarks.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Before we start, I want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in BuzzFeed last night.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to the president-elect's campaign to drop highly salacious and flat-out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"According to BuzzFeed's own editor, there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"The executive editor of The New York Times also dismissed the report by saying it was, quote, ""Totally unsubstantiated, echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet.""",0,0,1,1,1,1
The fact that BuzzFeed and CNN made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"The report is not an intelligence report, plain and simple.",0,0,0,1,0,0
One issue that the report talked about was the relationship of three individuals associated with the campaign.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"These three individuals; Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen and Carter Page.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Carter Page is an individual who the president-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"Paul Manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and Michael Cohen, who is said to have visited Prague in August and September did not leave or enter the United States during this time.",0,0,1,1,1,1
We asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no doubt that he was not in Prague.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In fact, Mr. Cohen has never been in Prague.",0,0,1,0,1,1
A new report actually suggests that Michael Cohen was at -- at the University of Southern California with his son at a baseball game.,0,0,0,1,1,1
One report now suggested apparently it's another Michael Cohen.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"For all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgraceful.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"With that, it is my honor to introduce the next vice president of the United States, Mike Pence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
We are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States of America.,0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am profoundly honored and humbled that I will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the United States nine days from today, but I'm even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make America great again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, the president-elect's leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as the chairman of the transition effort, I can assure the American people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring.",0,0,0,0,0,0
To see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Nineteen of the 21 cabinet officials have been announced, nine committee hearings already scheduled, seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a -- it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Perhaps that's why there's been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You know, I have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and I always will be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But with freedom comes responsibility.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report, when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news, can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the president-elect and our incoming administration and the American people are sick and tired of it.",0,0,0,1,1,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"But today, we'll get back to real news, to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the American economy and assembling a team that will make America great again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we'll hear from the president-elect about issues that are of paramount importance to the American people today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, it is my honor to introduce to all of you, my friend and the president-elect of the United States of America, Donald Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on an almost daily basis.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences and it's good to be with you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news, but I do have to say that -- and I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Who knows, but maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"A tremendous blot, because a thing like that should have never been written, it should never have been had and it should certainly never been released.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I want to thank a lot of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years -- a couple in particular -- and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"So, I just want to compliment many of the people in the room.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you, there were some news organizations with all that was just said that were so professional -- so incredibly professional, that I've just gone up a notch as to what I think of you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've had some great news over the last couple of weeks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've been quite active, I guess you could say, in an economic way for the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A lot of car companies are going to be moving in, we have other companies -- big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the Midwest.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You saw yesterday Fiat Chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"Ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in Mexico and they're going to be moving into Michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant.",0,1,1,0,1,1
I appreciate that from Ford.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I appreciate it very much from Fiat Chrysler.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope that General Motors will be following and I think they will be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think a lot of people will be following.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think a lot of industries are going to be coming back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to get our drug industry back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our drug industry has been disastrous.,0,0,0,1,1,0
They're leaving left and right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they're getting away with murder.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Pharma, pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there's very little bidding on drugs.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We're the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don't bid properly and we're going to start bidding and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time.,0,0,0,1,1,1
And we're going to do that with a lot of other industries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the F--35, you've been reading about it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And it's way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget.",0,0,0,1,1,1
I don't like that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the admirals have been fantastic, the generals have been fantastic.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've really gotten to know them well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're going to do some big things on the F--35 program, and perhaps the F--18 program.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're going to get those costs way down and we're going to get the plane to be even better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're going to have some competition and it's going to be a beautiful thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, we've been very, very much involved, and other things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We had Jack Ma, we had so many incredible people coming here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are no -- they're going to do tremendous things -- tremendous things in this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they're very excited.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will say, if the election didn't turn out the way it turned out, they would not be here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They would not be in my office.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They would not be in anybody else's office.,0,0,1,1,0,0
They'd be building and doing things in other countries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, there's a great spirit going on right now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A spirit that many people have told me they've never seen before, ever.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to create jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I said that I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I mean that, I really -- I'm going to work very hard on that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but I think we're going to do a real job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm very proud of what we've done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we haven't even gotten there yet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I look very much forward to the inauguration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to be a beautiful event.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have great talent, tremendous talent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have the -- all of the bands -- or most of the bands are from the different -- from the different segments of the military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I've heard some of these bands over the years, they're incredible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to have a very, very elegant day.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special; very beautiful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we're going to have massive crowds because we have a movement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a movement like the world has never seen before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a movement that a lot of people didn't expect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And even the polls -- although some of them did get it right, but many of them didn't.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And that was a beautiful scene on November 8th as those states started to pour in.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and they're gonna have a lot of security.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They're going to have a lot of good news for their veterans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, speaking of veterans, I appointed today the head secretary of the Veterans Administration, David Shulkin.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And we'll do a news release in a little while.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Tell you about David, he's fantastic -- he's fantastic.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He will do a truly great job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One of the commitments I made is that we're gonna straighten out the whole situation for our veterans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our veterans have been treated horribly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They're waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days, cases where they go in and they have a minor early-stage form of cancer and they can't see a doctor.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"By the time they get to the doctor, they're terminal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not gonna happen, it's not gonna happen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, David is going to do a fantastic job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to be talking to a few people also to help David.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the Veterans Administration, like the Cleveland Clinic, like the Mayo Clinic, a few more than we have.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And we're gonna set up a -- a group.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"These are hospitals that have been the top of the line, the absolute top of the line.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they're going to get together with their great doctors -- Dr. Toby Cosgrove, as you know from the Cleveland Clinic, has been very involved.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Ike Perlmutter has been very, very involved, one of the great men of business.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And we're gonna straighten out the V.A.,0,0,0,0,0,0
for our veterans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've been promising that for a long time and it's something I feel very, very strongly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, you'll get the information on David.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think you'll be very impressed with the job he does.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We looked long and hard.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We interviewed at least 100 people, some good, some not so good.",0,0,0,0,1,1
But we had a lot of talent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we think this election will be something that will, with time -- with time, straighten it out and straighten it out for good 'cause our veterans have been treated very unfairly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK, questions?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, John?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thanks so much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Appreciate it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on Friday that we're looking for further clarification on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, did the heads of the intelligence agencies provide you with the two-page summary of these unsubstantiated allegations?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And secondly to that, on the broader picture, do you accept their opinion that Vladimir Putin ordered the hack of the DNC and the attempted hack of the RNC?",0,0,1,1,0,0
"And if you do, how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the United States?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"OK, first of all, these readings as you know are confidential, classified.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I'm not allowed to talk about what went on in a meeting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And -- but we had many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will say, again, I think it's a disgrace that information would be let out.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I saw the information; I read the information outside of that meeting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's all fake news.,0,0,0,1,0,0
It's phony stuff.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It didn't happen.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people.",0,0,0,1,1,1
It was a group of opponents that got together -- sick people -- and they put that crap together.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So, I will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"It should have never been -- number one, shouldn't have even entered paper.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But it should have never have been released.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I read what was released and I think it's a disgrace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it's an absolute disgrace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as hacking, I think it was Russia.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I -- I can say that you know when -- when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn't make a big deal out of that.",0,0,1,1,1,1
That was something that was extraordinary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was probably China.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We had -- we had much hacking going on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And one of the things we're gonna do, we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we've assembled.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world -- they were never in the same room together as a group.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And we're gonna put those minds together and we're going to form a defense.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I have to say this also, the Democratic National Committee was totally open to be hacked.",0,0,0,1,1,1
They did a very poor job.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"They could've had hacking defense, which we had.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"And I will give Reince Priebus credit, because when Reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And they tried to hack the Republican National Committee and they were unable to break through.,1,0,1,1,1,1
We have to do that for our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's very important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
... just to the last part of that question how could all of this potentially color your attempts to build a better relationship with President Putin?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you know, President Putin and Russia put out a statement today that this fake news was indeed fake news.",0,0,0,1,1,1
They said it totally never happened.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Now, somebody would say, ""Oh, of course he's gonna say that.""",0,0,0,1,0,0
I respected the fact that he said that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I -- I'll be honest, I think if he did have something, they would've released it; they would've been glad to release it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think, frankly, had they broken into the Republican National Committee, I think they would've released it just like they did about Hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like Mr. Podesta, said about her.",0,0,1,1,0,0
I mean what he said about her was horrible.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"If somebody said about me, what Podesta said about Hillary, I was the boss, I would've fired him immediately or that person.",0,0,1,1,0,0
Because what he said about her was horrible.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But remember this,0,0,0,0,0,0
That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn't report it?,0,0,0,1,0,0
That's a horrible thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's a horrible thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you imagine that if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate -- it would've been the biggest story in the history of stories.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they would've said immediately, ""You have to get out of the race.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody even talked about it.,0,0,1,1,0,0
It's a very terrible thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Can I ask you a question, sir?",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Mr. President-elect.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On that intelligence report, the second part of their conclusion was that Vladimir Putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Do you accept that part of the finding?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And will you undo what President Obama did to punish the Russians for this or will you keep it in place?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, if -- if Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Russia can help us fight ISIS, which, by the way, is, number one, tricky.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I mean if you look, this administration created ISIS by leaving at the wrong time.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"The void was created, ISIS was formed.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's called an asset, not a liability.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, I don't know that I'm gonna get along with Vladimir Putin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But there's a good chance I won't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if I don't, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Does anybody in this room really believe that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Give me a break.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
... President Obama...,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
"... make clear whether during your visits to either Moscow or St. Petersburg, you engaged in conduct that you now regret and that a reasonable...",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
Would a reasonable observer say that you are potentially vulnerable to blackmail by Russia or by its intelligence agencies?,0,0,0,1,0,0
Lemme just tell you what I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I leave our country, I'm a very high-profile person, would you say?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I am extremely careful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm surrounded by bodyguards.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm surrounded by people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I always tell them -- anywhere, but I always tell them if I'm leaving this country, ""Be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you're gonna probably have cameras.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm not referring just to Russia, but I would certainly put them in that category.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And number one, ""I hope you're gonna be good anyway.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can't see them and you won't know.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You better be careful, or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
I tell this to people all the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was in Russia years ago, with the Miss Universe contest, which did very well -- Moscow, the Moscow area did very, very well.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I told many people, ""Be careful, because you don't wanna see yourself on television.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Cameras all over the place.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And again, not just Russia, all over.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Does anyone really believe that story?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[LAUGHTER],0,0,0,0,0,0
LaughterCrosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
... how you plan to disentangle yourself from your business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But first, I have to follow-up on some of these Russian remarks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Based on your comments here today, do you believe the hacking was justified?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Does Russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I tweeted out that I have no dealings with Russia.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"I have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we've stayed away.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And I have no loans with Russia.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"As a real estate developer, I have very, very little debt.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I have assets that are -- and now people have found out how big the company is, I have very little debt -- I have very low debt.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But I have no loans with Russia at all.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And I thought that was important to put out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I certified that.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"So I have no deals, I have no loans and I have no dealings.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to, I just don't want to because I think that would be a conflict.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So I have no loans, no dealings, and no current pending deals.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, I have to say one other thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Over the weekend, I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the Middle East, Hussein Damack, a friend of mine, great guy.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And I was offered $2 billion to do a deal in Dubai -- a number of deals and I turned it down.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"I didn't have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a no-conflict situation because I'm president, which is -- I didn't know about that until about three months ago, but it's a nice thing to have.",1,0,0,0,0,1
But I don't want to take advantage of something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have something that others don't have, Vice President Pence also has it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I don't think he'll need it, I have a feeling he's not going to need it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I have a no conflict of interest provision as president.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"It was many, many years old, this is for presidents.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Because they don't want presidents getting -- I understand they don't want presidents getting tangled up in minutia; they want a president to run the country.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So I could actually run my business, I could actually run my business and run government at the same time.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would be the only one to be able to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can't do that in any other capacity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as president, I could run the Trump organization, great, great company, and I could run the company -- the country.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd do a very good job, but I don't want to do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, all of these papers that you see here -- yes, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
...do you believe the hacking was justified?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And will you release your tax returns to prove what you're saying about no deals in Russia?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm not releasing the tax returns because as you know, they're under audit.",0,0,1,1,1,1
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
"But every president since the '70's has had a required audit from the IRS, the last place to release them, but as president sir...",1,0,0,0,1,1
"You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, OK?",1,0,0,0,0,0
They're the only who ask.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't think the American public is concerned about it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
No I don't think so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I won, when I became president.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"No, I don't think they care at all.",0,0,1,1,0,0
I don't think they care at all.,0,0,1,1,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you care -- I think you care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, you learn very little to a tax return.",1,0,0,0,0,0
What you should go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And actually, people have learned a lot about my company and now they realize, my company is much bigger, much more powerful than they ever thought.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We're in many, many countries, and I'm very proud of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what I'm going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They are going to be running it in a very professional manner.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're not going to discuss it with me.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Again, I don't have to do this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They're not going to discuss it with me.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And with that, I'm going to bring up Sheri Dillon, and she's going to go -- these papers are just some of the many documents that I've signed turning over complete and total control to my sons.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
Good morning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's my honor and privilege to be here today at President-elect Trump's request.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He's asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps he's taking.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As you know, the business empire built by President-elect Trump over the years is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of Nelson Rockefeller when he became vice president.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"But at that time, no one was so concerned.",0,0,0,0,0,0
President-elect Trump wants the American public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people's business and not his own.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"To that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm Morgan Lewis and Bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the company.",0,0,0,0,1,1
He further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As he said, he's voluntarily taking this on.",0,0,0,0,1,0
The conflicts of interest laws simply do not apply to the president or the vice president and they are not required to separate themselves from their financial assets.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"The primary conflicts of interest statutes and some have questioned it, is Section 18 USC 208 and it's simply inapplicable by its terms.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And this is not just our interpretation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's Congress itself who have made this clear in 1989 when it amended Section 18 USC 202 to state that, except as otherwise provided, the terms office and employee in section 208 shall not include the president.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Even so, President-elect Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests.",0,0,0,1,0,0
He instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Critical to the Morgan Lewis team is Fred Fielding, standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush as well as serving on President George H.W.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Bush's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the Ethics Resource Center.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Mr.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"He's here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as Eric, Don, along with others, take over management of the Trump organization.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the president-elect is taking.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, President-elect Trump's investments and business assets commonly known as the -- as the Trump Organization, comprising hundreds of entities which, again, if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement, the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to January 20th.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Here is just some of the paperwork that's taking care of those actions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Second, through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the Trump Organization to his sons Don and Eric and a longtime Trump executive, Allen Weisselberg.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Together, Don, Eric and Allen will have the authority to manage the Trump Organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Further, at the president-elect's direction, the trust agreement provides -- that to ensure the Trump Organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards, an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"The written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"President-elect Trump as well as Don, Eric and Allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency.",0,0,0,0,0,0
President-elect Trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the Trump Organization entities.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Further, in addition, his daughter Ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the Trump Organization.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"As she and Jared move their family to D.C., Ivanka will focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schools.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The president-elect has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"As a result, the trust will have two types of assets; first, it will hold liquid assets.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Cash, cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio, one that is consistent with the regulations from the Office of Government Ethics.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Second, the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid, but very valuable business assets, the ones that everyone here is familiar with.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Trump owned, operated and branded golf clubs, commercial rental property, resorts, hotels, rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of Trump-Marks Productions and Goods.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Things like Trump Tower, Mar-a--Lago, all of his other business assets, 40 Wall Street will all be in the trust.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Through instructions in the trust agreement, President-elect trust -- President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"This impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"As you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for President-elect Trump, but also for Don, Ivanka and Eric.",0,0,1,1,1,1
The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals.,0,0,1,1,1,1
No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump's presidency.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"New domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Because any new deal could -- and I emphasize could -- be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions, and any new deal must receive written approval.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"To further reinforce the wall that we are building between President-elect Trump and the Trump Organization, President-elect Trump has ordered, through his trust agreement, to sharply limit his information rights.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole.,0,0,0,0,0,1
There will be no separate business by business accounting.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Another step that President-elect Trump has taken is he created a new position at the Trump Organization; the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the Trump businesses, again, are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"He has also directed that no communications of the Trump Organization, including social media accounts, will reference or be tied to President-elect Trump's role as president of the United States or the office of the presidency.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"In sum, all of these actions -- complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, sharply limited information rights -- will sever President-elect Trump's presidency from the Trump Organization.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Some have asked questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why not divest?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why not just sell everything?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Form of blind trust.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'd like to turn to addressing some of those questions now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Selling, first and foremost, would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"In fact, it would exacerbate them.",0,0,0,1,0,0
The Trump brand is key to the value of the Trump Organization's assets.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"If President-elect Trump sold his brand, he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it, and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Further, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Was it too high, is there pay for play, was it too much pay to curry favor with the president-elect.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale.,0,0,1,1,0,1
President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people, and selling the entire Trump Organization isn't even feasible.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Some people have suggested that the president-elect sell the business to his adult children.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"This would require massive third-party debt sourced with multiple lenders, whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And if the president-elect were to finance the sale himself, he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns now.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Some people have suggested that the Trump -- that President-elect Trump could bundle the assets and turn the Trump Organization into a public company.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a non-starter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the Trump Organization.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Some people have suggested a blind trust, but you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses.",0,0,0,0,0,1
President Trump can't unknow he owns Trump Tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the Trump Organization are well publicized.DILLON,0,0,0,0,1,1
I'm going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's a word I think we've all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're gonna describe some other actions that President-elect Trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Emoluments comes from the Constitution.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Constitution says ""officials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office.""",0,0,0,1,1,1
"The so-called Emoluments Clause has never been interpreted, however, to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder.",0,0,0,1,1,1
No one would have thought when the Constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Instead, it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But since President-elect Trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They suggest that the Constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm's-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isn't even aware of.,0,0,1,1,1,1
These people are wrong.,0,0,0,1,0,0
This is not what the Constitution says.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office.,1,0,0,0,0,1
It's not an emolument.,1,0,1,0,0,1
The Constitution does not require President-elect Trump to do anything here.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"But, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So, President-elect Trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the United States Treasury.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"This way, it is the American people who will profit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In sum, I and president-elect's other advisers at Morgan Lewis have determined the approach we've outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the president-elect and his family.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the president-elect's desire to be isolated from his business interests and give the American people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making America great again, bringing back jobs to this country, securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The American people were well -- well aware of President-elect Trump's business empire and financial interests when they voted.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Many people voted for him precisely because of his business success.,0,0,0,0,1,0
President-elect Trump wants to bring this success to all Americans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0

"Mr. Trump, from America News.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What is your response to your critics that say not only you, but also your Cabinet is filled with conflicts of interest? And do you plan to set an example in the future to make sure that your -- your Cabinet and everyone throughout your administration...",0,0,0,0,0,0

"I -- I really think that when you watch what's going on with what's happening in -- I was just watching, as an example, Rex Tillerson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it's brilliant what he's doing and what he's saying.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I watched yesterday, as you know, our great senator, who is going to be a great attorney general.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And he was brilliant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what people don't know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in Alabama.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And he was brilliant yesterday.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I really think that they are -- I think we have one of the great Cabinets ever put together.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've been hearing that from so many people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People are so happy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, in the case of Rex, he ran incredibly Exxon Mobil.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"When there was a find, he would get it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When they needed something, he would be there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A friend of mine who's very, very substantial in the oil business, Harold Hamm -- big supporter -- he said there's nobody in the business like Rex Tillerson.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And that's what we want.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what I want to bring to government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to bring the greatest people into government, because we're way behind.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't make good deals any more.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I say it all the time in speeches.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't make good deals anymore; we make bad deals.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Our trade deals are a disaster.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"So we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking, they're smart.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's what I'd put, I'm very proud of the Cabinet, I think they're doing very well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's very interesting how it's going, but it's -- I think they're doing very, very well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
"... a quick follow-up on -- on Russia, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Mr. President-elect.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I wanted to ask a few questions on Obamacare?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah. Can you be specific on what guidance you're giving congressional Republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace, whether it needs to be simultaneous or...",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Finally, Obamacare, I thought it was never gonna be asked.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"...though if you have outlined a plan for what you want the replace package to look like, would it guarantee coverage for those who have gotten health insurance through the current Obamacare law?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You're gonna be very, very proud, as not only the media and reporters, you're gonna be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Obamacare is a complete and total disaster.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"They can say what they want, they can guide you anyway they wanna guide you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In some cases, they guide you incorrectly.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"In most cases, you realize what's happened, it's imploding as we sit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some states have over a hundred percent increase and '17 and I said this two years ago, '17 is going to be the bad year.",1,0,1,0,1,1
It's going to be catastrophic.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Frankly, we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn't be fair to the people.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a Chuck Schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come, they would come, begging to us please, we have to do something about Obamacare.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We don't wanna own it, we don't wanna own it politically.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They own it right now.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"So the easiest thing would be to let it implode in '17 and believe me, we'd get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary's approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It'll be repeal and replace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It will be essentially, simultaneously.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So we're gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And we're gonna get a health bill passed, we're gonna get health care taken care of in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have deductibles that are so high, that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so high.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Obamacare is the Democrats problem.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're doing them a tremendous service by doing it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We could sit back and let them hang with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are doing the Democrats a great service.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we'll be filing a plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it was actually, pretty accurately reported today, The New York Times.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And the plan will be repeal and replace Obamacare.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We're going to have a health care that is far less expensive and far better. OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was going right here.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"President-elect Trump, Jon Steinberg from Cheddar.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you look at all the meetings that you've had with Carrier, SoftBank and Alibaba, do you conceive of making this a program, maybe sitting inside of commerce?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then my follow-up question to that, is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cuts?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, if I can save jobs, for instance I was doing individual companies and people said well, that's only one company, like we did a good job with Carrier.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I wanna thank United Technologies which owns Carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs.",1,1,0,0,1,1
"And they were gone and Mike Pence and his staff really helped us, a lot.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But those were -- that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving so it's always tough when they're building a plan, just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You want to move your plant and you think, as an example, you're going to build that plant in Mexico and you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you're making, and you're going to sell it through what will be a very, very strong border -- not a weak border like it is -- we don't even have a border.",0,0,1,1,0,1
It's an open sieve.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you're going to sell through a very strong border -- not going to happen.,0,0,0,1,0,0
You're going to pay a very large border tax.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great American workers that got you there in the first place, you can move from Michigan to Tennessee and to North Carolina and South Carolina.",0,0,0,0,1,0
You can move from South Carolina back to Michigan.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You can do anywhere -- you've got a lot of states at play; a lot of competition.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So it's not like, oh, gee, I'm taking the competition away.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You've got a lot of places you can move.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I don't care, as along as it's within the United States, the borders of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you'd have millions more workers right now in the United States that are -- 96 million really wanting a job and they can't get.,1,0,0,1,1,1

Are those claims correct?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, and before we do anything, I've been abundantly clear on this.",0,0,0,0,0,0

That's 45 percent of the problem right there.,0,0,0,1,1,0

People didn't want to have part-time jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,1

They were part-time jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,1

That — my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation.,0,0,0,1,1,0
You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.,0,0,1,1,1,0

Why shouldn't investigators have everything at their disposal?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, in fact what I have said is the only thing — the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago — the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Apple initially came out saying, ""We're being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device.""",0,0,1,1,1,1
That is not accurate.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"The only thing they're being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode that's in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And I think they should comply with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If that's all they're asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue; Apple is not necessarily wrong here.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"But just to be clear — just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?",0,0,0,0,0,0

That Apple phone didn't even belong to the killer.,0,0,0,1,1,1

That is all they're asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world.,0,0,0,1,1,1

I would agree with Apple on that broad policy question.,0,0,0,0,0,0

He respectfully gave it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today.",0,0,0,0,1,1

"He didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong -- what he did in terms of the information he saw.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally.",0,0,0,1,1,0
That's the real problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it.",0,0,0,1,1,1

It's all fake news.,0,0,0,1,0,0
It's all fake news.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal -- I think it's very important -- the illegal, giving out classified information.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"It was -- and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll give you an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I called, as you know, Mexico.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"It was a very, very confidential, classified call.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I called Mexico.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"All of a sudden, it's out there for the world to see.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's supposed to be secret.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Same thing with Australia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Everybody saw this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that's classified?,0,0,0,0,0,1
How do they do it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves.,1,0,0,1,1,0
"But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Yes, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because when I looked at the information, I said, ""I don't think he did anything wrong; if anything, he did something right.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
He was coming into office.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He looked at the information.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said, ""Huh, that's fine.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what they're supposed to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're supposed to -- he didn't just call Russia.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were 30-some-odd countries.",0,0,0,0,1,1
He's doing the job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, he was doing his job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The thing is, he didn't tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn't remember.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But he didn't tell the vice president of the United States the facts.,0,0,0,1,1,1
And then he didn't remember.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that just wasn't acceptable to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"President Trump, clarification here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"During your campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence?",0,0,0,1,0,0

"The failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday.",0,0,1,1,0,0

It was -- it's a joke.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"They weren't even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They -- I hadn't spoken to them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the one person -- I don't think I've ever spoken to him.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I don't think I've ever met him.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And he actually said he was a very low-level member of I think a committee for a short period of time.,0,0,0,1,0,1
I don't think I ever met him.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him.",0,0,1,1,0,0
I didn't talk to him ever.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And he thought it was a joke.,0,0,0,1,0,0
The other person said he never spoke to Russia; never received a call.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That's what he does.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, people know that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's Mr. Manafort, who's -- by the way, who's by the way a respected man.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He's a respected man.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody -- people knew that.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Everybody knew that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And he said that very forcefully.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I saw his statement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He said it very forcefully.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories.,0,0,0,1,1,1
So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I have no loans in Russia.,0,0,1,0,1,1
I don't have any deals in Russia.,0,0,1,0,1,1

"But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country.",0,0,0,0,1,0
So that's the extent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Russia is fake news.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there, because we have our new people going in place, right now.",0,0,0,0,1,0

"And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time's story, yesterday.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And it talked about -- these are front page.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"And I'll tell you something, I'll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I've never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented.",0,0,1,1,0,0
I said give us the retraction.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I am.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just wanted to get untangled.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes.",0,1,0,0,1,1

George H.W.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Bush, 426 when he won as President.",0,0,1,0,1,0
So why should Americans trust --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"...I'm skipping that information, I don't know, I was just given we had a very, very big margin.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you're providing information that's fake?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, I don't know, I was given that information.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I was given -- I actually, I've seen that information around.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that's...",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0

"Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did -- whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed?",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with?",0,0,0,0,0,0
What -- what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Can we ask what you're going to do and also, we've heard about a -- a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they're in position so I hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he's offered his services and you know, it's something we may take advantage of.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But I don't think we're need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as the general's concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn't sound wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said he doesn't think anything is wrong, you know, really didn't think.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"It was really, what happened after that but he didn't think anything was done wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I didn't either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said ""well I don't see"" -- to me, he was doing the job.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The information was provided by -- who I don't know, Sally Yates.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"And I was a little surprised because I said ""doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"As far as -- as far as the actual making the call, fact I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That was very normal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So -- and I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sir, if I could, on the leaks -- on the leaks, sir...",0,0,0,0,0,0
...Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Finish off then I'll get you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm sorry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What will you do on the leaks?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've said twice today...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"...Yes, we're looking at them very -- very, very serious.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Those are criminal leaks.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They're put out by people either in agencies -- I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate.",0,0,0,1,0,1
We just had Jeff Sessions approved.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Injustice, as an example.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So, we are looking into that very seriously.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a criminal act.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"You know what I say, when I -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I said ""you know, it doesn't make sense.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That won't happen"" but that wasn't that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who's a very fine man, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Same thing with Australia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said ""that's terrible that it was leaked"" but it wasn't that important.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But then I said to myself ""what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea?""",0,0,0,1,0,0
What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very -- you know, I mean at the highest level?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Are you going to be reporting about that too?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I don't want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So I'm dealing with Mexico, I'm dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All this information gets put into the ""Washington Post"" and gets put into the ""New York Times"" and I'm saying ""what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We got to stop it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why it's a criminal penalty.,0,0,0,1,1,0
I just want to get you to clarify this very important point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Well the leaks are real.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real.",0,0,0,0,1,1
The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.,0,0,0,1,1,1
So one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because there's nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's very important to me and especially in this position.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's very important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't mind bad stories.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true and, you know, over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm OK with that.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But I'm not OK when it is fake.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, I watch CNN, it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I don't watch it any more because it's very good -- he's saying no.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's OK, Jim.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's OK, Jim, you'll have your chance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I watch others too.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're not the only one so don't feel badly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think it should be straight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it should be -- I think it would be frankly more interesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know how good everybody's ratings are right now but I think that actually -- I think that'd actually be better.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think that's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't know, Peter, is that one right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because you know I think they have lower -- I heard lower than Congress.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I'd appreciate it -- again, I don't mind bad stories when it's true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I think we're setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"I mean, the numbers are crazy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I'm looking, some of them had them approved immediately.",0,0,0,0,1,0
I'm going forever and I still have a lot of people that we're waiting for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's all they're doing, is delaying.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And you look at Schumer and the mess that he's got over there and they have nothing going.,0,0,0,1,0,0
The only thing they can do is delay.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And, you know, I think that they'd be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody's good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And sometimes -- I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that's OK. That's fine.",0,0,0,0,1,0

This is pure delay tactics.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And they say it, and everybody understands it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The first part of my question on contacts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you definitively say that nobody --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I had nothing to do with it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I have nothing to do with Russia.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they're not giving classified information.",1,0,0,1,1,1
They're giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"Which, by the way, nobody mentions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.,0,1,0,1,1,1
Can you imagine -- seriously -- can you imagine if I received the questions?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It would be the electric chair.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK, he should be put in the electric -- you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Yes?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We'll do you next Jim, I do you next.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador —,0,0,0,0,0,0

And then fired him —,0,0,1,0,0,0
Excuse me. Did you fire him because,0,0,0,1,0,0
[Inaudible],0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence.",0,0,1,0,1,0
Very simple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mike was doing his job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He was calling countries and his counterparts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that's his job.",0,0,0,0,0,0

OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jim?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don't hate you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't hate you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, pass that along —",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ask -- ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, that's -- well, you know, we do have other people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You do have other people and your ratings aren't as good as some of the other people that are waiting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's pretty good right now, actually.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK, go ahead, John.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle.",0,0,0,1,1,1
You welcomed that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
At one time —,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was OK with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
-- you said -- you said that you loved WikiLeaks.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Then, your numbers were off too.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"No -- no, but I did say 30.",0,0,0,0,1,0
But it was actually higher than that.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"If -- if I may ask you, sir, it -- it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during the campaign —",0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK, fair question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ready?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, if I may ask you that —",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No -- no, but let me do one at a time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
If I may as a follow up?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you mind?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, in one case, you're talking about highly classified information.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"In the other case, you're talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I will say this, if John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.",0,0,1,1,0,0
He said terrible things about her.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it wasn't classified information.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"But in one case, you're talking about classified -- regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I don't want to be hacked.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And we did that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed.,1,0,0,1,1,0
The DNC did not do that.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"And if they did it, they could not have been hacked.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But they were hacked and terrible things came in.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn't even in the papers.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would have been headline in every newspaper.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, think of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They gave her the questions to a debate and she -- and she should have reported herself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why did Hillary Clinton announce that, ""I'm sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it's inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job.""",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake.",0,0,0,1,1,1
I guess I don't understand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It seems that there's a disconnect there.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The reporting is fake. Look, look...",0,0,0,1,1,1
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what it is?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's the thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The public isn't -- you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They don't know if it's true or false because they're not involved.,0,0,0,1,1,1
I'm involved.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've been involved with this stuff all my life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm involved.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I just see many, many untruthful things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll tell you what else I see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I see tone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know the word ""tone.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
The tone is such hatred.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm really not a bad person, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that -- the tone is such hatred.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I watched this morning a couple of the networks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I have to say, Fox & Friends in the morning, they're very honorable people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they have the most honest morning show.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's all I can say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's the most honest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the tone, Jim.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you look -- the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets...",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You just take a look at that show.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is a constant hit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump.,0,0,0,1,1,0
The good news is he doesn't have good ratings.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump.,0,0,0,1,1,0
And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth; the hatred coming from other people on your network.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, I will say this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I watch it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I see it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm amazed by it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I just think you'd be a lot better off, I honestly do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The public gets it, you know.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They want to throw their placards at CNN.,0,0,1,1,0,0
You know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I -- I think you would do much better by being different.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you just take a look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's -- it's brutal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, they'll take this news conference -- I'm actually having a very good time, OK?",0,0,0,0,0,0

OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, that's how I won.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I won with news conferences and probably speeches.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's for sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm having a good time.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"OK. Now I checked it -- I said -- they said, ""No, sir.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I said, ""Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But aren't you -- aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don't like ""fake news""?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Why not just say it's a story I don't like.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you call it ""fake news,"" you're undermining confidence in our news media.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Isn’t that important?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0

OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I know what's good and bad.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I know what's bad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive -- sometimes something that should be very positive, they'll make OK.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They'll even make it negative.,0,0,0,1,0,0
So I understand it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, because I'm there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know what was said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know who's saying it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So it's very important to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Mr. President?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, since you...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We're doing Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We're in final stages.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"It's not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner.",0,0,0,0,0,1

Yes?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, you mentioned Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You mentioned the vessel -- the spy vessel off the coast of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Not good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries; and a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Not good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I listened to you during the campaign ...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Excuse me, excuse me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
When did it happen?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, ""Hey, we're back to the old games with the United States; there's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us.""",0,0,0,1,0,1
Because the -- you have to understand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, ""Oh, isn't that wonderful.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I know you well enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then you would say, ""Oh, he was too tough; he shouldn't have done that."" Look, all of the...",0,0,0,1,0,0

Excuse me just one second.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
"All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal.",0,0,0,1,0,0
So Hillary Clinton tries a re-set.,0,0,1,0,1,0
It failed.,0,0,0,1,1,0
They all tried.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm different than those people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How are you interpreting those moves?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what do you intend to do about them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm so beautifully represented.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm so honored that the Senate approved him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's going to be fantastic.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I think that I've already...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I don't think so.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't know.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We might.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We might not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to do the right thing for the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.",0,0,0,0,0,1
There's no up-side.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I have been briefed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Who did I say is not good?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"No, I read off the three things that have recently happened.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Each one of them you said they're not good.,0,0,0,0,1,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, it's not good, but they happened.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But do they damage the relationship?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do they undermine...,0,0,0,0,0,0
They all happened recently. No...,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
... this country's ability to work with Russia?,0,0,0,0,0,0
They all happened recently.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I understand what they're doing because they're doing the same thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, again, maybe I'm not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if I don't, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Does anybody in this room really believe that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal.",0,0,1,1,0,0
She had the re-set.,0,0,1,0,0,0
She gave all that valuable uranium away.,0,0,0,0,1,0
She did other things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, they say I'm close to Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States.,0,0,1,0,1,1
She's close to Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can we...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what I gave?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nothing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?,0,0,0,1,0,0
I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't talk about military response.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't say I'm going into Mosul in four months.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to attack Mosul in four months.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Then three months later, ""We are going to attack Mosul in one month.""",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you know why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I don't talk about military, and I don't talk about certain other things, you're going to be surprised to hear that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, my whole campaign, I'd say that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I don't have to tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't want to be one of these guys that say, ""Yes, here's what we're going to do.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't have to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Wait a minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because they shouldn't know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I'm not going to tell you.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But hopefully, I won't have to do anything, but I'm not going to tell you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Could I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The trouble...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Where are you from?,0,0,0,0,0,0
BBC.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's another beauty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's a good line.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. President...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just like CNN right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
On the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, I do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me tell you about this government...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Were there any mistakes...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know who you are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just wait.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me tell you about the travel ban.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban.,0,0,1,0,1,0
But we had a bad court.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Got a bad decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We had a court that's been overturned.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Again, may be wrong.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But I think it's 80 percent of the time, a lot.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We had a bad decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to keep going with that decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to put in a new executive order next week some time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we had a bad decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban.,0,0,0,0,1,0
You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Very bad for the safety and security of our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The rollout was perfect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I said this to my people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Give them a one-month period of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month -- the bad ones.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"You do agree there are bad people out there, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
That not everybody that's like you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have some bad people out there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Kelly said you can't do that.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And he was right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I said how about one week?,0,0,0,0,0,0
He said no good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don't have time to come in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now nobody ever reports that.,0,0,1,1,1,0
But that's why we did it quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, if I would've done it a month, everything would've been perfect.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The problem is we would've wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would've come into our country.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now in the meantime, we're vetting very, very strongly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Very, very strongly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we need help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we need help by getting that executive order passed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just a brief follow-up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if it's so urgent, why not introduce...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I told you this.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high.",0,0,0,0,1,1

Stephen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements.,0,0,0,0,1,1
You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Doesn't this program take jobs away from Americans?,0,0,0,1,0,0
If it's being abused the way Disney did.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans, but that you've tried to hire Americans.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India.",0,0,1,1,1,1
That company then hoards up all of these visas.,0,0,1,0,1,0
They hire workers.,0,1,1,0,1,0
You hire — Disney or some other company hires this company.,0,0,0,0,0,1
What they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"It is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans.",0,0,1,1,1,1

"Well first, I think — well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"If there's an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that's in violation of the law.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"And what I'm explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not — what they are doing is they are eliminating the job.",0,0,0,1,1,1
They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company.,0,0,0,0,1,1
They are making the argument that we didn't replace you.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead.,0,0,1,0,1,1
And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad.,0,0,0,0,1,1

"And in order to be correct on this issue, here's the bottom line.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We do work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There is — Islam has a major problem on its hands.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"It has a significant percentage of its adherents, particular in the Sunni faith but also in the Shia, who have been radicalized.",0,0,0,0,1,1

There is no doubt about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face, we are going to have to work together with other — with Muslims, who do not — who are not radicals.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"We're going to have to work with the Egyptians to defeat, for example, ISIS.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ bell rings ],0,0,0,0,0,0
It will take a Sunni Arab movement to defeat them.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And so I think you can be correct without meaning to be politically correct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to have to work with people of the Muslim faith even as Islam itself faces a serious crisis within it of radicalization.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"No, I don't.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think there is a sect of, you know, this radical Islam that is really, really serious, and poses the greatest threat to us today.",0,0,0,1,0,0
There isn't any question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's why the whole world has to work together to make sure that we don't have proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But look, I was there when, and saw it, when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States was in the Rose Garden bringing the Arab Muslim world to work with us to repel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"The fact is that if we're going to defeat ISIS, we're going to have to have these countries.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And they are Egypt.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And they are Saudi Arabia.,0,0,0,0,0,1

And I frankly think the Europeans went in the wrong direction when they rejected Turkey from joining in to the economic sphere of Europe.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"The simple fact of the matter is, a lot of these Muslim countries, they are just — they can't believe the stuff they see out of people who have distorted their faith.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Look, the people who represent radical Islam, they want to destroy everything that we're about and other Muslims who don't share their view.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But at the end of the day, we've got to bring the world together, the civilized world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we all speak with one voice to make sure that people who sit on the fence understand what civilization is, and we represent it, and equality and hope for everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Governor Kasich.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"You said that the U.S. has to, quote, ""take out"" the families of terrorists.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"When it was pointed out that targeting civilians is against the Geneva Conventions, you said, quote, ""So they can kill us, but we can't kill them?""",0,0,0,1,1,1
"It is against federal, military and international law to target civilians.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"So how will you order the military to target the families of suspected terrorists, while also abiding by the law?",0,0,0,1,0,0

"Now, we have to obey the laws.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Have to obey the laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we have to expand those laws, because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out ISIS and all of the others that are so bad.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We better expand our laws or we're being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us.",0,0,0,1,0,0

"Senator Rubio, would you as president pursue a policy of targeting the families of suspected terrorists?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"No, of course not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we don't have to in order to defeat terrorists.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's difficult to do, but it has to be done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I'm president of the United States, the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They're going to be expanded.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And then the best military in the world, which needs to be rebuilt because — because Barack Obama is gutting our military.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"He's going to leave us with the smallest Army since the end of World War II, and the smallest Navy in a century, and the smallest Air Force we've ever had.",0,0,0,0,1,1

I have not made that decision yet.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't know if I get any credit for it but I'm self-funding my campaign.,0,1,0,0,0,0

"And now his argument is after four decades of being part of that influence buying, after Hillary Clinton spending decades being part of that influence selling, that suddenly he will change.",0,0,0,1,0,0

"Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond, but specifically you talked about flexibility and one of the examples you gave was the height of the border fence.",0,0,0,0,0,1

Does it matter at all that the gap between the rich and everyone else is widening?,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think the Federal Reserve has made this problem worse.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"By artificially keeping interest rates below the market rate, average ordinary citizens have a tough time earning interest, have a tough time making money.",0,0,0,1,0,1
They're actually talking now about negative interest.,0,0,0,1,0,0
The money as it's created through quantitative easing or other means tends to start out in the big banks in New York.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"And because we're now paying interest for them to keep the money there, much of that money has not filtered out into the economy.",0,0,0,1,1,1
So what we're finding is there is increasing income disparity and income inequality.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"We also find that as the Federal Reserve destroys the value of the currency, what you're finding is that, if you're poor, if you make $20,000 a year and you have three or four kids, and you're trying to get by, as your prices rise or as the value of the dollar shrinks, these are the people that are hurt the worst.",0,0,0,1,0,1
So really we need to reexamine whether we not — we want a Federal Reserve that's involved so much in determining interest rates.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We also need to look at root causes as to what caused the housing boom and the housing collapse.,0,0,0,0,0,1

They're saying how do you come up with that decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It cannot be more simple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So they're ruling on what I just read you and they don't even quote it in their ruling because you can't because it's too obvious.,0,0,0,1,1,1
So we will do something next week.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you'll be impressed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's see what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's the bottom line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to keep our country safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You look at what's happening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to keep our country safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sweden, who would believe this.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Sweden.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They took in large numbers.,0,0,1,0,1,0
They're having problems like they never thought possible.,0,0,0,1,0,0

We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people.,1,0,1,0,0,1
There was no documentation.,0,0,1,0,0,0
There was no nothing.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So we're going to keep our country safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we all have heart, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what I want to do is build safe zones in Syria and other places so they can stay there and live safely until their cities and their country, that mess that I was left by Obama and everybody else — folks, we were left a mess like you wouldn't believe, but we're going to build safe zones.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have those safe zones.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We do owe $20 trillion.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we're going to have the gulf states pay for those safe zones.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They've got nothing, but money.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We're going to do it that way instead of taking massive numbers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Tens the of thousands of people into our country and we don't know anything about those people.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"We want people to come into our country, but we want people that love us.",0,0,0,0,0,0

We owe them so much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our veterans are going to be taken care of for once and for all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our system and our country has led down our veterans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are not going to let that go on any further.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You wait and you see what we're going to be doing for our great veterans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you veterans.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've already imposed a five year lobbying ban on the executive branch officials and lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.,0,0,1,1,1,1
And there's another major promise I have kept to the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've nominated a fantastic justice to replace the late great Justice Scalia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch.,0,0,0,0,0,0

His writings are truly amazing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He will be a true, true defender of our constitution.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So let's tell the Senate Democrats to support his nomination for the good of the country because what's happening with the Democrats — no wonder they're doing so badly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
No wonder they're doing so badly.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You take a look, race after race, I just want the tell you, in case you didn't read it, of course you're reading the fake news, but the Democrats were supposed to win the presidency.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That didn't happen.,0,0,0,1,1,0
They were supposed to take over the Senate.,0,0,1,1,0,1
That didn't happen.,0,0,0,1,1,0
And they were supposed to take over potentially even the House.,0,0,0,1,0,1
It was going to be four weeks out the greatest defeat in the modern history of American politics.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it was, but it was for the Democrats, not for the Republicans.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So we have to tell the Democrats, because they're doing the wrong thing for the American people, to stop their tactics of delay and obstruction and destruction.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They got to get on with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My administration is also pushing ahead strongly with very historic tax reform.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We are working to lower tax rates in the middle class to reduce tax rates big league on businesses and to make our tax code more fair and very simple for all Americans so it's understandable by everyone.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Senate Democrats should work with us to lower taxes and bring back our jobs, but the Democrats want to increase your taxes very, very substantially.",0,0,0,1,1,1
We're not going let that happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Also time for the Senate Democrats to take responsibility for Obamacare and to work with us to replace it with new reforms that reverse this nation-wide healthcare tragedy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a tragedy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You look at some states, Arizona, up 116%.",0,0,1,0,1,1

"Sit back for two years, let it explode.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Democrats will come and beg for us to do something, but we can't do that to the American people.",0,0,0,1,0,0
We have to fix it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we will.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need members of both parties to join hands and work with us to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to build new roads and bridges and airports and tunnels and highways and railways all across our great nation.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You're all part of this incredible movement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This movement that we talk about so much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's been written about on the cover of every magazine all over the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It's a movement that is just sweeping.,0,0,0,0,0,0

It undermines democracy and trade prosperity.,0,0,0,1,1,1
We're giving it away.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"The so-called global elite have done well for themselves, but left working families with shrinking wages.",0,0,0,1,0,1

But in the past week you've mocked Mr. Trump's tan.,0,0,0,1,0,0

So what happened?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, you know, Bret, let me say something.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This campaign for the last year Donald Trump has basically mocked everybody with personal attacks.,0,0,0,1,1,0

He has done so about people that are disabled.,0,0,0,0,1,0

You are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars...,0,0,1,1,1,1

Of course you are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, you're not, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's put up full screen number 2.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You say that Medicare could save $300 billion a year negotiating lower drug prices.,0,0,1,0,1,1
But Medicare total only spends $78 billion a year on drugs.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Sir, that's the facts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You are talking about saving more money on Medicare prescription drugs...,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I'm saying saving through negotiation throughout the economy, you will save $300 billion a year.",0,0,0,0,1,1
But that doesn't really cut the federal deficit.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And that's a huge — of course it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to buy things for less money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That works out...,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the only money that we buy — the only drugs that we pay for is through Medicare.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"I'm not only talking about drugs, I'm talking about other things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We will save $300 billion a year if we properly negotiate.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We don't do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't negotiate.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Senator Cruz, one of centerpieces of your campaign, in fact, you mentioned it again tonight, is that you will abolish the IRS.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Question though, who will collect the taxes that you are still calling for?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Who will oversee to make sure that people pay the taxes that they rightfully owe?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And who will check on the various tax deductions and tax credits that you still want?,0,0,0,0,0,0
So my simple flat tax I have rolled out in precise detail how it will operate where every American can fill out our taxes on a postcard.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And if you want to actually see the postcard, see all the details, you can find them on our Web site.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's tedcruz.org.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When he we get rid of all the corporate welfare, all the subsidies, all the carve-outs in the IRS code, it dramatically simplifies it.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And under Obama, the IRS has become so corrupt and so politicized we need to abolish it all together.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Now, at the end of that there will still be an office in the Treasury Department to receive the postcards but it will be dramatically simpler.",0,0,0,0,0,1

You're angry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're angry at Washington, and he uses angry rhetoric.",0,0,0,1,0,0

"And you're not going to stop the corruption in Washington by supporting someone who has supported liberal Democrats for four decades, from Jimmy Carter to John Kerry to Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,1,0,1
You're not going to stop the corruption and the cronyism by supporting someone who has used government power for private gain.,0,0,0,1,0,0

I have been supporting people for many years.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I've supported everybody, because, until recently, I wasn't a politician, and I hope maybe you don't all consider me a politician right now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I hate the term politician.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I've been supporting politicians.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Part of the problem we have in Washington, Chris...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0

"You support raising the minimum wage, although you say not to the $15 an hour that Democrats are talking about.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Mr. Trump opposes any increase because he says it will price American workers out of the world market.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Is he wrong about that?,0,0,0,1,0,0
No increase in the minimum wage?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, well, wait a minute, first of all, I didn't say I was for an increase in the federal minimum wage.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I said in Ohio we increased it modestly every single year.,0,0,1,0,1,1
So I'm not for a federal minimum wage increase.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you did talk about states doing it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, states — if states want to do it, they ought to sit down with businesspeople and the lawmakers and figure out what will work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But hold on a second here with everything else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm the only person on this stage who actually was the chief architect of balancing the federal budget.,0,0,0,0,1,0
It's not a theory for me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not — it's not some — you have to know how to put everything together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you know, I spent 10 years of my life to get there, and I did not do that because I'm worshiping at some balanced budget shrine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The reason I did it is when you have commonsense regulations, lower taxes on individuals and businesses, and you have a fiscal plan that makes sense, the job creators will expand employment.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And what happened?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I was there, the jobs were exploding.",0,0,1,0,1,0
Bill Clinton's tried to take credit for it.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"When I went to Ohio, we're up 400,000 jobs.",0,1,1,0,1,1
It's the same formula.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it isn't easy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I fought the entire Washington establishment and won, because when you balance a budget, you must affect every single thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Everything in the federal government specifically.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You cannot get there with theories or broad statements, and you have to be willing to take the heat.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, I fought a Republican president, who I thought was not offering constructive proposals to fix this economy.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"So when we talk about all this, there's one person on this stage and one person who's been a candidate for president in either party that restored economic strength, growth, a balanced budget, paid down debt, cut taxes, the things that people in this country want.",0,0,0,0,0,1

Let's talk immigration for a little bit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Cruz, let's start with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have repeatedly touted how you have stood shoulder to shoulder with Senator Jeff Sessions to fight illegal immigration and amnesty.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But Senator Sessions just endorsed Donald Trump.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"If voters want Jeff Sessions-style immigration policies, isn't their choice rather clear?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, their choice is very clear.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you look to the actual record — you know, Donald mentioned a moment ago that he was just doing business when he was writing checks to liberal Democrats.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"But that's not, in fact, the checks he was writing.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"Listen, we could all understand if you write a check to a city commission because you're looking for a zoning waiver on building a building.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"That may be corrupt, but you could understand real estate developers doing that.",0,0,0,1,0,0
That's not what Donald Trump did.,0,0,0,1,1,0
Donald Trump supported Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Donald supported John Kerry over George W. Bush.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"If you don't like Obamacare, Donald Trump funded Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi taking over Congress to pass Obamacare.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"On immigration, if you don't like amnesty, if you don't like the Gang of Eight, Donald Trump funded five of the eight members of the Gang of Eight $50,000.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And let's talk about this election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The choice Republican primary voters are making is who is best prepared to stand up to Hillary Clinton and beat Hillary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Donald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once, not twice, not three times.",1,0,1,1,1,1
Ten times.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign.,0,0,1,1,1,0
It wasn't that she was the New York senator and it was a cost of doing business.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It was to her presidential campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald Trump in 2008 wrote four checks to elect Hillary Clinton as president.,0,0,1,0,1,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I'd like to ask Donald, why did you write checks to Hillary Clinton to be president in 2008?",0,0,0,0,0,0
It wasn't for business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And how can you stand on a debate stage now with her and say you don't think she should be president?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Actually, it was for business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It was.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I pride myself, including outside of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm doing almost 120 deals outside of the — which I hope to be able to stop very soon and let my children handle it — but we're doing many, many deals outside of the United States.",0,0,0,0,1,1

"In 2008, I supported Hillary Clinton.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"I supported many other people, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that was because of the fact that I'm in business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I did support very heavily Ronald Reagan.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I also supported George Bush, by the way.",0,0,0,0,1,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump...,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what would you say...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, stand by — stand by, Senator Cruz.",0,0,0,0,0,0

You have suggested that you may have expressed some flexibility when it comes to the size of the wall that you want to build.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But did you tell them, specifically, that you are flexible when it comes to your deportation plan?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't know exactly what — when you talk about off the record.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, Buzzfeed?",0,0,0,0,0,0
They were the ones that said under no circumstances will I run for president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And were they wrong.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But a lot of people said that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then, I did have a meeting with the editorial board of the New York Times, a very nice meeting.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Many of those things were off the record, I think at their suggestion and my suggestion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think being off the record is a very important thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it's a very, very powerful thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These three gentlemen have gone off the record many times with reporters.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think they want to honor it, and I would always honor that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will say, though, in terms of immigration — and almost anything else — there always has to be some, you know, tug and pull and deal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, when I watch Ted stand on the Senate floor, I had great respect for what he did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He stood there for a day-and-a- half or something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the meantime, what came of it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nothing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have to be able to have some flexibility, some negotiation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, sometimes you ask for more than you want and you negotiate down to the point.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I may have discussed something like that with the New York Times, but I would never release off-the-record conversations.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I don't think it's fair, frankly, to do that to anybody.",0,0,0,1,0,0
How flexible are you on this issue?,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not very flexible.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Mexico is going to pay for the wall.,0,0,1,1,0,0

But — and I used an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And this isn't necessarily what was said, but whatever was said, the wall's 50 feet high.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Is it going to be 45 feet or 40 feet?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That could very well be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That could very well — he wants it to be higher.,0,0,0,0,1,0

There's always negotiation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the best negotiator that knows what he's doing will make a great deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm not just saying that now; I said it throughout that process.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We do need to do with this issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ audience booing ],0,0,0,0,0,0
When I'm president it will not be dealt with the way it was done in the Senate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It will be done first and foremost by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving it to the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And only after that is done can anything else happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it will be something the American people support.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Will you authorize of The Times to release the tapes?,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's OK. That's not the worst thing in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There is nothing wrong with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0

And I'm going to repeat it again.,0,0,0,0,0,0

The reason that our campaign has done so well is because we're doing something very radical: We're telling the American people the truth.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to deal with many of the issues both of you just raised.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to begin with a question that goes right to the heart of which one of you should be the Democratic presidential nominee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, in the last week, you've raised questions about Secretary Clinton's qualifications to be president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You said that something is clearly lacking in terms of her judgment and you accused her of having a credibility gap.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"So let me ask you, do you believe that Secretary Clinton has the judgment to be president?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I've known Secretary Clinton, how long, 25 years?",0,0,0,0,0,1
We worked together in the Senate.,0,0,0,0,1,0

"Washington Post headline says ""Clinton Campaign says Sanders is Unqualified"" and that's what the surrogates were saying.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and the intelligence to be a president?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course she does.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
But I do question...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
-- but I do question her judgment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I question a judgment which voted for the war in Iraq...,0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country, voted for virtually every disastrous trade agreement which cost us millions of decent-paying jobs.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And I question her judgment about running super PACs which are collecting tens of millions of dollars from special interests, including $15 million from Wall Street.",0,0,1,1,1,1
I don't believe that that is...,0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
-- the kind of judgment we need to be the kind of president we need.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it is true that now that the spotlight is pretty bright here in New York, some things have been said and Senator Sanders did call me unqualified.",0,1,1,1,0,1
I've been called a lot of things in my life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was a first.,0,1,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
And then he did say that...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
-- he had to question my judgment.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, the people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and...",0,0,0,0,1,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
-- and...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
-- and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to ask me to be secretary of State for the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, look, we have disagreements on policy.",0,0,0,1,0,0
There's no doubt about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if you go and read, which I hope all of you will before Tuesday, Senator Sanders' long interview with the ""New York Daily News,"" talk about judgment and talk about the kinds of problems he had answering questions about even his core issue, breaking up the banks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When asked, he could not explain how...",0,0,0,0,0,0

"-- when asked about a number of foreign policy issues, he could not answer about Afghanistan, about Israel, about counterterrorism, except to say if he'd had some paper in front of him, maybe he could.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I think you need to have the judgment on day one to be both president and commander-in-chief.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And let's talk about judgment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes!,0,0,0,0,0,0

And let us talk about the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country...,0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
I led the opposition to that war.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton voted for that.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Well, let's talk about judgment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's talk about super PACs and 501(c)(4)s, money which is completely undisclosed.",0,1,1,1,0,1
Where does the money come from?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do we really feel confident about a candidate saying that she's going to bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think so.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Secretary?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"You know, let me tell you why.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You may not like the answer, but I'll tell you why.",0,0,0,0,0,0
President Obama had a super PAC when he ran.,0,0,1,0,1,0
President Obama took tens of millions of dollars from contributors.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And President Obama was not at all influenced when he made the decision to pass and sign Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulations...",0,0,1,0,1,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
-- on Wall Street in many a year.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So this is -- this is a phony -- this is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support, to undergird the continuation that he is putting forward in these attacks.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Thank, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to continue on this, but I want Dana Bash to continue with the questioning.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clint, the government announced yesterday that five of the biggest banks on Wall Street have failed to develop plans to dismantle themselves in the event of another financial crisis.",0,0,1,1,1,1
This is the second time in two years those banks neglected to come up with credible plans.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"So, as president, would you call on regulators to start the process of breaking up these banks?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Something that the law not only allows, but actually explicitly encourages?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, this is what I've saying for the past year.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No bank is too big to fail, no executive too powerful to jail.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have been talking about what we should be doing under Dodd- Frank.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm glad that Senator Sanders is now joining in talking about Dodd-Frank, because Dodd-Frank sets forth the approach that needs to be taken.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe, and I will appoint regulators who are tough enough and ready enough to break up any bank that fails the test under Dodd-Frank.",0,0,0,0,0,1
There are two sections there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If they fail either one, that they're a systemic risk, a grave risk to our economy, or if they fail the other, that their living wills, which is what you're referring to, is inadequate.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Let's look at what is at stake here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can never let Wall Street wreck Main street again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I spoke out against Wall Street when I was a Senator from New York.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I have been standing up and saying continuously we have the law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to execute under it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, you're right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will move immediately to break up any financial institution, but I go further because I want the law to extend to those that are part of the shadow banking industry.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The big insurance companies, the hedge funds, something that I have been arguing for now a long time...",0,0,0,1,0,0
...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, you were recently asked what you would replace the big Wall Street banks with if you could break them up.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"You said, quote, ""That's their decision.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why would you trust the banks to restructure themselves?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, Dana...",0,0,0,0,0,0
when you said the whole business model was fraudulent?,0,0,0,1,0,0
That's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, let's start off with the basic premise.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A few days ago Goldman Sachs formally reached a settlement with the United States government for $5 billion dollars.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"What Goldman Sachs acknowledged was, essentially, that they were selling fraudulent packages of subprime mortgage loans.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Goldman Sachs was not the only bank, other banks, of course, did the same.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Now, I don't need Dodd-Frank now to tell me that we have got to break up these banks, A, because they're based on fraudulent principles, and B, because when you have six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 58% of the GFP of this country, they are just too big, too much concentration of wealth and power.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"But, Senator...",0,0,0,0,0,0
The point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But Senator, you didn't answer the specific question which is not just about breaking up the banks, but why allow the banks to do it themselves?",0,0,0,1,0,1
Because I'm not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've got to be a certain size.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I don't know that it's appropriate that the Department of Treasury to be making those decisions.,0,0,0,1,0,1
What we need is to make sure that they are safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dana, you know -- I love being in Brooklyn.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dana, let me add here that there are two ways to at this under Dodd-Frank, which is after all the law we passed under President Obama, and I'm proud that Barney Frank, one of the authors, has endorsed me because what I have said continuously is, yes, sometimes the government may have to order certain actions.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That has to be the judgement of the regulators.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, there's another element to this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement.,0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"They should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution, we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Thank you, Madam Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And hold them accountable as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, you have consistently criticized Secretary Clinton for accepting money from Wall Street.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Can you name one decision that she made as senator that shows that he favored banks because of the money she received?,0,0,0,0,1,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The obvious decision is when the greed and recklessness and illegal behavior of wall street brought this country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Recession -- the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of people lost their jobs, and their homes, and their life savings, the obvious response to that is that you've got a bunch of fraudulent operators and that they have got to be broken up.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"That was my view way back, and I introduced legislation to do that.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Now, Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225,000 a speech.",0,0,1,1,1,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
So the problem response -- the proper response in my view is we should break them up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's what my legislation does.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you can tell, Dana, he cannot come up with any example, because there is no example.",0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
It is important -- it's always important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It may be inconvenient, but it's always important to get the facts straight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I stood up against the behaviors of the banks when I was a senator.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I called them out on their mortgage behavior.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I went to the secretary of state office, the president -- President Obama led the effort to pass the Dodd-Frank bill.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That is the law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, this is our ninth debate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the prior eight debates, I have said, we have a law.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"You don't just say, we're upset about this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm upset about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You don't just say, go break them up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have a law, because we are a nation of laws.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Thank you, Madam Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I support Dodd-Frank, but I have consistently said that's not enough.",0,0,0,0,1,0
We've got to include the shadow banking sector.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton called them out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So they must have been very, very upset by what you did.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Look, here is the difference and here is the clear difference.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These banks, in my view, have too much power.",0,0,1,1,0,0
They have shown themselves to be fraudulent organizations endangering the well-being of our economy.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"If elected president, I will break them up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have got legislation to do that, end of discussion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, if I may, Senator Sanders keeping bringing up the speeches that you gave to Goldman Sachs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I'd like to ask you, so you've said that you don't want to release the transcripts, until everybody does it, but if there's nothing in those speeches that you think would change voters' minds, why not just release the transcripts and put this whole issue to bed?",0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, first of all -- first of all, there isn't an issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I was in public service serving as the senator from New York, I did stand up to the banks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I did make it clear that their behavior would not be excused.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives, as Senator Sanders did, which led to a lot of the problems that we had with Lehman Brothers.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, if you're going to look at the problems that actually caused the Great Recession, you've got to look at the whole picture.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"It was a giant insurance company, AIG.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It was an investment bank, Lehman Brothers.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It was mortgage companies like Countrywide.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not saying that Senator Sanders did something untoward when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives...,0,0,0,1,1,1
Madam Secretary...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... but the fact is he did.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And that contributed to the collapse of Lehman Brothers and started the cascade...,0,0,0,0,1,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, one second, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, the question was about the transcripts of the speeches to Goldman Sachs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Why not release them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have said, look, there are certain -- there are certain expectations when you run for president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a new one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I've said, if everybody agrees to do it -- because there are speeches for money on the other side.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you this, there is -- there is a long-standing expectation that everybody running release their tax returns, and you can go -- you can go to my website and see eight years of tax returns.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I've released 30 years of tax returns.,0,0,0,0,1,1

"Secretary Clinton, I want you to respond to that, but why did you put out that statement blaming Vermont and its gun policy for some of the death of -- by guns in New York?",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Well, the facts are that most of the guns that end up committing crimes in New York come from out of state.",0,1,1,1,1,1
They come from the states that don't have kind of serious efforts to control guns that we do in New York.,0,1,0,1,1,1
"But let me say this -- in 1988, as we've heard on every debate occasion, Senator Sanders did run for the Congress and he lost.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"He came back in 1990 and he won, and during that campaign he made a commitment to the NRA that he would be against waiting periods.",0,0,0,0,1,1

"He clearly was helped by the NRA, because they ran ads against his opponent.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Voting -- he kept his word to the NRA, he voted against the Brady Bill five times because it had waiting periods in it.",0,0,0,1,1,1

Do you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What we need to do is to do everything that we can to make certain that guns do not fall into the hands of people who do not have them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued.",0,0,0,1,0,1

"They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I don't think I owe them an apology.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.",1,0,0,1,1,1
"This is a -- this is a unique gift given to only one industry in the world by the United States Congress, as Senator Murphy from Connecticut said, we have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And the point that Senator Sanders keeps making about how he wouldn't want a mom and pop store -- that was not the point of this.,0,0,0,1,0,0

New York City was on the brink of being able to hold manufacturers and dealers accountable through a very carefully crafted legal strategy.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The NRA came to their supporters in the Congress and said, stop it, stop it now, and Senator Sanders joined those who did.",0,0,0,0,1,1

"Senator, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me just reiterate -- just reiterate so there is no confusion, decades ago, before it was popular, in a rural state with no gun control, Bernie Sanders said, let's ban assault weapons, not see them distributed in the United States of America.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's turn it over to Errol Lewis, of New York 1 Time Warner Cable News.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, the 1994 crime bill that you supported added 100,000 police officers across the country and banned certain assault weapons.",0,0,0,0,1,1
It also imposed tougher prison sentences and eliminated federal funding for inmate education.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Looking at the bill as a whole, do you believe it was a net positive or do you think it was a mistake?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think that it had some positive aspects to it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you mentioned some of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Violence Against Women Act, which has been a very important piece of legislation, in my opinion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And it also did some things which were to provide more opportunities for young people.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"So if we were to have the balance sheet on one side, there are some positive actions and changes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the other side, there were decisions that were made that now we must revisit and we have to correct.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I think that sentences got much too long.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The original idea was not that we would increase sentences for non-violent low-level offenders, but once the federal government did what it did, states piled on.",0,0,0,1,1,1
So we have a problem.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And the very first speech I gave in this campaign was about what I will do to reform the criminal justice system and end the over-mass incarceration.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"So I think that if all of us go and look back at where we were, Senator Sanders voted for the crime bill, and he says the same thing, there were some good things, and things that we have to change and learn from.",0,0,0,0,1,1
So that's how I see it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we ought to be putting our attention on forging a consensus to make the changes that will divert more people from the criminal justice system to start.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
To tackle systemic racism and divert people in the beginning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now earlier this year, a South Carolina voter told your daughter Chelsea, quote, ""I think a lot of African-Americans want to hear, you know what, we made a mistake.""",0,0,0,1,0,0

Do you regret your advocacy for the crime bill?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, look, I supported the crime bill.",0,0,0,1,1,0

"He was the president who actually signed it, Senator Sanders...",0,0,0,0,1,1
"But what about you, Senator?",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people's lives.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I've seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"That's why I chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue, Errol, because I want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I also want people...,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Senator Sanders, earlier this week at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, you called out President Clinton for defending Secretary Clinton's use of the term super-predator back in the '90s when she supported the crime bill.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Why did you call him out?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because it was a racist term, and everybody knew it was a racist term.",0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, much of what Secretary Clinton said was right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We had a crime bill.,0,0,1,0,1,0
I voted for it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
It had the Violence Against Women Act in it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When as mayor of Burlington, we worked very hard to try to eliminate domestic violence.",0,0,0,0,1,1

We're talking about the weapon that killed the children in Sandy Hook.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"This banned assault weapons, not insignificant.",0,0,1,1,0,0
But where we are today is we have a broken criminal justice system.,0,0,0,1,1,1
We have more people in jail than any other country on Earth.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And in my view, what we have got to do is rethink the system from the bottom on up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that means, for a start -- and we don't talk about this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The media doesn't talk about it -- you got 51 percent of African-American kids today who graduated high school who are unemployed or underemployed.,0,0,0,0,1,1
You know what I think?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Maybe we invest in jobs and education for those kids, not jails and incarceration.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And I'll tell you what else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll tell you what else I think.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that is, we have got -- and this is the difference between the secretary and myself as I understand it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have got to have the guts to rethink the so-called war on drugs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Too many lives...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Too many lives have been destroyed because people possessed marijuana, millions over a 30-year period.",0,0,1,1,1,1

Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's -- let's get Secretary Clinton's response.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, look, I think that, as Senator Sanders said about what I said, I will say about what he said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that we recognize that we have a set of problems that we cannot ignore and we must address.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that is why I have been promoting for my entire adult life, I think, the idea of investing early in kids, early childhood education, universal pre-K, like what Mayor de Blasio brought to New York.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We have got to help more kids get off to a good start.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... and to be really focused on how we build ladders of opportunity and tear down these barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your time's up, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, I have a question for you related to this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So you've said that by the end of your first term as president, the U.S. will no longer lead the world in mass incarceration.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"To fulfill that promise, you'd have to release roughly half a million prisoners.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"How are you going to do that, since the vast majority of American prisoners are not under federal jurisdiction?",0,0,0,0,1,1
We're going to work with state governments all over this country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And you know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In a very divided Congress, and a very divided politics in America, actually the one area where there is some common ground is conservatives understand that it's insane to be spending $80 billion a year locking up 2.2 million people.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"With federal and presidential leadership, we will work with state governments to make sure that people are released from jail under strong supervision, that they get the kind of job training and education they need so they can return to their communities.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"On this one, Errol, actually I think you're going to see progressive and conservative support.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We can do it, if we're prepared to be bold.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to take a quick commercial break.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a lot more questions for Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders right after this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Welcome back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's turn to another critically important issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, Secretary, the issue of energy and the environment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders has said you are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry.",0,0,0,0,1,1
You say you're sick and tired of him lying about your record.,0,0,0,1,0,0
What are his lies?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And that's why for the last many years, both in the Senate and as secretary of State, it's been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there has never been any doubt that when I was a senator, I tried -- I joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And I have proposed that again, because that's what I think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And everyone who's looked at this independently, ""The Washington Post"" and others, who give us both hard times when called for on facts, have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"So, we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Best we can tell from the reports that are done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, that is not being supported by big oil, and I think it's important to distinguish that.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"And, let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to get to that to, but I want you to respond, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is one thing, as the Secretary indicated, to talk about workers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm sure I have contributions, you have contributions from workers in every industry in the country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But, as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry maxed out, gave the maximum amount of money to Secretary Clinton's campaign.",0,1,1,1,1,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, that's not saying -- and, then some people say, well, given the hundreds of millions of dollars she raises it's a small amount.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That's true.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, that does not mean to say that the lobbyists thought she was a pretty good bet on this issue.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, what I think is when we look at climate change now, we have got to realize that this is a global environmental crisis of unprecedented urgency.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, it is not good enough.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, if we, God forbid, were attacked tomorrow the whole country would rise up and say we got an enemy out there and we got to do something about it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
That was what 9/11 was about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have an enemy out there, and that enemy is going to cause drought and floods and extreme weather disturbances.",0,0,0,1,0,1
There's going to be international conflict.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"(APPLAUSE) I am proud, Wolf, that I have introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation...",0,0,0,0,0,0
... Thank you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... Including a tax on carbon.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Something I don't believe Secretary Clinton supports.,0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, go ahead and respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let's talk about the global environmental crisis.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Starting in 2009 as your Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to bring China and India to the table for the very first time, to get a commitment out of them that they would begin to address their own greenhouse gas emissions.",0,0,0,0,1,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I continued to work on that throughout the four years as Secretary of State, and I was very proud that President Obama and America led the way to the agreement that was finally reached in Paris with 195 nations committing to take steps to actually make a difference in climate change.",0,0,0,0,1,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, I was surprised and disappointed when Senator Sanders attacked the agreement, said it was not enough, it didn't go far enough.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You know, at some point putting together 195 countries, I know a little bit about that, was a major accomplishment...",0,0,1,0,1,0
... Thank you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"... And, our President led the effort to protect our world and he deserve our appreciation, not our criticism...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"... Go ahead, Senator...",0,0,0,0,0,0
... Let's talk about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you were Secretary of State, you also worked hard to expand fracking to countries all over the world.",0,0,0,0,1,1
(CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"The issue here -- of course the agreement is a step forward, but you know agreements and I know agreements, there's a lot of paper there.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We've got to get beyond paper right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have got to lead the world in transforming our energy system, not tomorrow, but yesterday.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"(APPLAUSE) And, what that means, Wolf, it means having the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I am on board legislation that says, you know what, we ain't going to excavate for fossil fuel on public land.",0,0,0,1,1,1
That's not Secretary Clinton's position.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let us support a tax on carbon...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... Not Secretary Clinton's position.,0,0,0,0,0,0
... Go ahead and respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm a little bewildered about how to respond when you have an agreement which gives you the framework to actually take the action that would have only come about because under the Obama administration in the face of implacable hostility from the Republicans in Congress, President Obama moved forward on gas mileage, he moved forward on the clean power plant.",0,0,0,0,1,1
He has moved forward on so many of the fronts that he could given the executive actions that he was able to take.,0,0,0,0,1,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, I am getting a little bit -- I'm getting a little bit concerned here because, you know, I really believe that the President has done an incredible job against great odds and deserves to be supported.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, it's easy -- it's easy to diagnose the problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's harder to do something about the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll continue on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Errol -- Errol Louis, go ahead with your question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Wolf.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wolf.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to continue on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Errol, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK. Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, you also pioneered a program to promote fracking around the world, as you described.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Fracking, of course, a way of extracting natural gas.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Now as a candidate for president, you say that by the time you're done with all your rules and regulations, fracking will be restricted in many places around the country.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Why have you changed your view on fracking?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, well, I don't think I've changed my view on what we need to do to go from where we are, where the world is heavily dependent on coal and oil, but principally coal, to where we need to be, which is clean renewable energy, and one of the bridge fuels is natural gas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And so for both economic and environmental and strategic reasons, it was American policy to try to help countries get out from under the constant use of coal, building coal plants all the time, also to get out from under, especially if they were in Europe, the pressure from Russia, which has been incredibly intense.",0,0,0,0,1,1
So we did say natural gas is a bridge.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"We want to cross that bridge as quickly as possible, because in order to deal with climate change, we have got to move as rapidly as we can.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's why I've set big goals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to see us deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to provide electricity to every home in America within 10 years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I have big, bold goals, but I know in order to get from where we are, where the world is still burning way too much coal, where the world is still too intimidated by countries and providers like Russia, we have got to make a very firm but decisive move in the direction of clean energy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, Senator?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, here is -- here is a real difference.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a difference between understanding that we have a crisis of historical consequence here, and incrementalism and those little steps are not enough.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Not right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not on climate change.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, the truth is, as secretary of state, Secretary Clinton actively supported fracking technology around the world.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Second of all, right now, we have got to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
And that means -- and I would ask you to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you in favor of a tax on carbon so that we can transit away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy at the level and speed we need to do?,0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I have laid out a set of actions that build on what President Obama was able to accomplish, building on the clean power plan, which is currently under attack by fossil fuels and the right in the Supreme Court, which is one of the reasons why we need to get the Supreme Court justice that President Obama has nominated to be confirmed so that we can actually continue to make progress.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I don't take a back seat to your legislation that you've introduced that you haven't been able to get passed.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I want to do what we can do to actually make progress in dealing with the crisis.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's exactly what I have proposed.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"OK, thank you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And my approach I think is going to get us there faster without tying us up into political knots with a Congress that still would not support what you are proposing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, you've said that climate change is the greatest change to our nation's security.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Secretary Clinton did not answer one simple question.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Excuse me, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator, Senator...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you for a tax on carbon or not?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a question for you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've said that climate change is the greatest threat to our nation's security.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You've called for a nationwide ban on fracking.,0,0,1,0,1,1
You've also called for phasing out all nuclear power in the U.S.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"But wouldn't those proposals drive the country back to coal and oil, and actually undermine your fight against global warming?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"No, they wouldn't.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Look, here's where we are.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me reiterate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a global crisis.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Pope Francis reminded us that we are on a suicide course.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Our legislation understands, Errol, that there will be economic dislocation.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It is absolutely true.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There will be some people who lose their job.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And we build into our legislation an enormous amount of money to protect those workers.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It is not their fault...,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is not their fault that fossil fuels are destroying our climate.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"But we have got to stand up and say right now, as we would if we were attacked by some military force, we have got to move urgency -- urgently and boldly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What does that mean?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator -- senator, jobs...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- jobs are one thing, but with less than 6 percent of all U.S. energy coming from solar, wind and geothermal, and 20 percent of U.S. power coming from nuclear, if you phase out all of that, how do you make up...",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Well, you don't phase...",0,0,0,0,0,0
-- that difference?,0,0,0,0,0,0
-- it all out tomorrow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you certainly don't phase nuclear out tomorrow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But this is what you do do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
What you do do is say that we are going to have a massive program -- and I had introduced -- introduced legislation for 10 million solar rooftops.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We can put probably millions of people to work retrofitting and weatherizing buildings all over this country.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"If we approach this, Errol, as if we were literally at a war -- you know, in 1941, under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we moved within three years, within three more years to rebuild our economy to defeat Nazism and Japanese imperialism.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That is exactly the kind of approach we need right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Lead the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0

(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's turn to another critically important issue...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
-- the issue of national security and foreign policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, President Obama says the worst mistake in office that he made over these past seven and a half years was not preparing for Libya after Moammar Qadafi was removed.",0,0,1,1,1,1
You were his secretary of State.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Aren't you also responsible for that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me say I think we did a great deal to help the Libyan people after Qadafi's demise.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And here's what we did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We helped them hold two successful elections, something that is not easy, which they did very well because they had a pent up desire to try to chart their own future after 42 years of dictatorship.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was very proud of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We got rid of the chemical weapons stockpile that Qadafi had, getting it out of Libya, getting it away from militias or terrorist groups.",0,0,1,1,1,1
We also worked to help them set up their government.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We sent a lot of American experts there.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"We offered to help them secure their borders, to train a new military.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"They, at the end, when it came to security issues, Wolf, did not want troops from any other country, not just us, European or other countries, in Libya.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And so we were caught in a very difficult position.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They could not provide security on their own, which we could see and we told them that, but they didn't want to have others helping to provide that security.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"And the result has been a clash between different parts of the country, terrorists taking up some locations in the country.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And we can't walk away from that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to be working with European and Arab partners...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
-- with the United Nations in order to continue to try to support them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self- government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I, as president, will keep trying to give that to them",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"According to ""The New York Times.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- for President Obama, this was a pretty tough call, like a 51-49 call, do you overthrow Qadafi, who, of course, was a horrific dictator?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"The New York Times"" told us it was Secretary Clinton who led the effect for that regime change.",0,1,0,0,1,1
And this is the same type of mentality that supported the war in Iraq.,0,0,0,0,1,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Look...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- Qadafi, Saddam Hussein are brutal, brutal murdering thugs.",0,0,0,1,1,0
No debate about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what we have got to do and what the president was saying is we didn't think thoroughly about what happens the day after you get rid of these dictators.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Regime change often has unintended consequences in Iraq and in Libya right now, where ISIS has a very dangerous foothold.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And I think if you studied the whole history of...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- American involvement in regime change, you see that quite often.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Secretary, we're going to let you respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, well, I...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
-- I...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- I -- I would just point out that there was a vote in the Senate as to whether or not the United States should support the efforts by the Libyan people to protect themselves against the threats, the genocidal threats coming from Gadhafi, and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek Security Council support.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"Senator sanders voted for that, and that's exactly what we did.",0,1,0,0,1,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"We went to the United Nations -- yes, he did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We went to the United Nations Security Council.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We got support from the Security Council.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And we then supported the efforts of our European and Arab allies and partners.,0,0,0,0,1,0
This was a request made to our government by the Europeans and by the Arabs because of their great fear of what chaos in Syria would do to them.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And if you want to know what chaos does, not just to the people inside but the people on the borders, look at Syria.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Nobody stood up to Assad and removed him, and we have had a far greater disaster in Syria than we are currently dealing with right now in Libya.",0,0,1,1,1,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton made this charge in previous debates and just repeating it doesn't make it truer.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"What you are talking about is what I think was what they call the unanimous consent, you know what that is, where basically, do we support Libya moving to democracy?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, you know what, I surely have always supported Libya moving to democracy.",0,1,0,0,1,0
But please do not confuse that with your active effort for regime change without contemplating what happened the day after.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Totally different issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that isn't...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Second of all -- second of all, if I might, in terms of Syria, in terms of Syria...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, let her respond to that, then we'll get to that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Go ahead, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There was also in that a reference to the Security Council, and I know you're not shy when you oppose something, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, yes, it was unanimous.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's exactly right, including you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And what we did was to try to provide support for our European and Arab allies and partners.,0,0,0,0,1,0
The decision was the president's.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did I do the due diligence?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did I talk to everybody I could talk to?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did I visit every capital and then report back to the president?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what a secretary of state does.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But at the end of the day, those are the decisions that are made by the president to in any way use American military power.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And the president made that decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, yes, we did try without success because of the Libyans' obstruction to our efforts, but we did try and we will continue to try to help the Libyan people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Go ahead, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you listen, you know -- two points.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, yes, 100-0 in the Senate voted for democracy in Libya and I would vote for that again.",0,0,0,0,1,1
But that is very different from getting actively involved to overthrow and bring about regime change without fully understanding what the consequence of that regime change would be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Second of all, I know you keep referring to Barack Obama all night here, but you in Syria, you in Syria talked about a no-fly zone, which the president certainly does not support, nor do I support because, A, it will cost an enormous sum of money, second of all, it runs the risk of getting us sucked into perpetual warfare in that region.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Thirdly, when we talk about Syria right now, no debate, like Gadhafi, like Saddam Hussein, Assad is another brutal murdering dictator, but right now our fight is to destroy ISIS first, and to get rid of Assad second.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Well, I think Senator Sanders has just reinforced my point.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, when I was secretary of state I did urge, along with the Department of Defense and the CIA that we seek out, vet, and train, and arm Syrian opposition figures so that they could defend themselves against Assad.",0,0,0,1,1,0
The president said no.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Now, that's how it works.",0,0,0,0,0,0
People who work for the president make recommendations and then the president makes the decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I think it's only fair to look at where we are in Syria today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, yes, I do still support a no-fly zone because I think we need to put in safe havens for those poor Syrians who are fleeing both Assad and ISIS and have some place that they can be safe.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Staying on national security, Dana Bash has a question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, in 1997, you said this about NATO, you said, quote: ""It is not the time to continue wasting tens of billions of dollars helping to defend Europe, let alone assuming more than our share of any cost associated with expanding NATO.""",0,0,0,1,1,1
Do you still feel that way?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, what I believe, if my memory is correct here, we spend about 75 percent of the entire cost of the military aspect of NATO.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Given the fact that France has a very good health care system and free public education, college education for their people, the U.K. has a good National Health Service and they also provide fairly reasonable higher education, you know what, yeah, I do believe that the countries of Europe should pick up more of the burden for their defense.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Yes, I do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And just following up, Senator Sanders, Donald Trump also argues that NATO is unfair economically to the U.S. because America pays a disproportionate share.",0,0,0,1,1,1
So how is what you say about NATO and your proposal different than his?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you got to ask -- you got to ask Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All I can tell you is, with a huge deficit, with 47 million people living in poverty, with our inner cities collapsing, yeah, I do think countries like Germany and U.K. and France and European countries whose economy, or at least its standard of living and health care and education, they're doing pretty well.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So I would not be embarrassed as president of the United States to stay to our European allies, you know what, the United States of America cannot just support your economies.",0,0,0,1,0,0
You got to put up your own fair share of the defense burden.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nothing wrong with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I support our continuing involvement in NATO.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it is important to ask for our NATO allies to pay more of the cost.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is a requirement that they should be doing so, and I believe that needs to be enforced.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But there's a larger question here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
NATO has been the most successful military alliance in probably human history.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"It has bound together across the Atlantic countries that are democracies, that have many of the same values and interests, and now we need to modernize it and move it into the 21st century to serve as that head of our defense operations in Europe when it comes to terrorism and other threats that we face.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, Madam Secretary...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"... yes, of course they should be paying more, but that doesn't mean if they don't we leave, because I don't think that's in America's interests.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"That's going to be part of my -- my question to you is, to that point, there are 28 countries in the alliance, and the United States gives more money to NATO's budget than 21 of those countries combined.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"If they don't agree to pay more, as you suggested, then what would you do as commander-in-chief?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will stay in NATO.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will stay in NATO, and we will continue to look for missions and other kinds of programs that they will support.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Remember, NATO was with us in Afghanistan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Most of the member countries also lost soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan.,0,0,0,0,1,1
They came to our rallying defense after 9/11.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That meant a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, yes, we have to work out the financial aspects of it, but let's not forget what's really happening.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"With Russia being more aggressive, making all kinds of intimidating moves toward the Baltic countries, we've seen what they've done in Eastern Ukraine, we know how they want to rewrite the map of Europe, it is not in our interests.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Think of how much it would cost if Russia's aggression were not deterred because NATO was there on the front lines making it clear they could not move forward.,0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, let's talk about the U.S. relationship with Israel.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, you maintained that Israel's response in Gaza in 2014 was, quote, ""disproportionate and led to the unnecessary loss of innocent life.""",0,0,0,1,1,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
What do you say to those who believe that Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees fit?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, as somebody who spent many months of my life when I was a kid in Israel, who has family in Israel, of course Israel has a right not only to defend themselves, but to live in peace and security without fear of terrorist attack.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That is not a debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"But -- but what you just read, yeah, I do believe that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Israel was subjected to terrorist attacks, has every right in the world to destroy terrorism.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"But we had in the Gaza area -- not a very large area -- some 10,000 civilians who were wounded and some 1,500 who were killed.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Free Palestine!,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, if you're asking not just me, but countries all over the world was that a disproportionate attack, the answer is that I believe it was, and let me say something else.",0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, let me say something else.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As somebody who is 100% pro-Israel, in the long run -- and this is not going to be easy, God only knows, but in the long run if we are ever going to bring peace to that region which has seen so much hatred and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"So what is not to say -- to say that right now in Gaza, right now in Gaza unemployment is s somewhere around 40%.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"You got a log of that area continues, it hasn't been built, decimated, houses decimated health care decimated, schools decimated.",0,0,1,1,1,1
I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That does not make me anti-Israel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That paves the way, I think...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator...",0,0,0,0,0,0
...to an approach that works in the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, do you agree with Senator Sanders that Israel overreacts to Palestinians attacks, and that in order for there to be peace between Israel and the Palestinians, Israel must, quote, end its disproportionate responses?",0,0,0,1,0,1
I negotiated the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012.,0,0,0,0,1,1
I did it in concert with...,0,0,0,0,1,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"President Abbas of the Palestinian authority based in Ramallah, I did it with the then Muslim Brotherhood President, Morsi, based in Cairo, working closely with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I can tell you right now I have been there with Israeli officials going back more than 25 years that they do not seek this kind of attacks.,0,0,0,1,1,1
They do not invite the rockets raining down on their towns and villages.,0,0,0,1,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
They do not believe that there should be a constant incitement by Hamas aided and abetted by Iran against Israel.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And, so when it came time after they had taken the incoming rockets, taken the assaults and ambushes on their soldiers and they called and told me, I was in Cambodia, that they were getting ready to have to invade Gaza again because they couldn't find anybody to talk to tell them to stop it, I flew all night, I got there, I negotiated that.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"So, I don't know how you run a country when you are under constant threat, terrorist tact, rockets coming at you.",0,0,0,1,0,0
You have a right to defend yourself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
That does not mean -- that does not mean that you don't take appropriate precautions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, I understand that there's always second guessing anytime there is a war.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It also does not mean that we should not continue to do everything we can to try to reach a two-state solution, which would give the Palestinians the rights and...",0,0,0,0,0,1
Thank you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... just let me finish.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The rights and the autonomy that they deserve.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, let me say this, if Yasser Arafat had agreed with my husband at Camp David in the Late 1990s to the offer then Prime Minister Barat put on the table, we would have had a Palestinian state for 15 years.",0,0,0,0,1,1
(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator, go ahead -- go ahead, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think that anybody would suggest that Israel invites and welcomes missiles flying into their country.,0,0,0,1,0,1
That is not the issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you evaded the answer.",0,0,0,0,1,0
You evaded the question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The question is not does Israel have a right to respond, nor does Israel have a right to go after terrorists and destroy terrorism.",0,0,0,1,0,1
That's not the debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Was their response disproportionate?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe that it was, you have not answered that.",0,0,0,1,0,0
(CHEERING),0,0,0,0,0,0
I will certainly be willing to answer it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think I did answer it by saying that of course there have to be precautions taken but even the most independent analyst will say the way that Hamas places its weapons, the way that it often has its fighters in civilian garb, it is terrible.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(AUDIENCE REACTION),0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not saying it's anything other than terrible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It would be great -- remember, Israel left Gaza.",0,0,0,0,1,0
They took out all the Israelis.,0,0,1,0,1,0
They turned the keys over to the Palestinian people.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And what happened?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hamas took over Gaza.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"So instead of having a thriving economy with the kind of opportunities that the children of the Palestinians deserve, we have a terrorist haven that is getting more and more rockets shipped in from Iran and elsewhere.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I read Secretary Clinton's statement speech before AIPAC.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I heard virtually no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Almost none in that speech.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"So here is the issue: of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term there will never be peace in that region unless the United States plays a role, an even-handed role trying to bring people together and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That is what I believe the world wants to us do and that's the kind of leadership that we have got to exercise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, if I -- I want to add, you know, again describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I have been involved, both as first lady with my husband's efforts, as a senator supporting the efforts that even the Bush administration was undertaking, and as secretary of state for President Obama, I'm the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the prime minister of Israel.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"There were only four of us in the room, Netanyahu, Abbas, George Mitchell, and me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Three long meetings.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure that the Palestinian people had the right to self-government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I believe that as president I will be able to continue to make progress and get an agreement that will be fair both to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever, ever undermining Israel's security.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"A final word, Senator, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There comes a time -- there comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time.",0,0,0,1,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Well...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... you know, I have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations I've had with him and other Israeli leaders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Nobody is saying that any individual leader is always right, but it is a difficult position.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you are from whatever perspective trying to seek peace, trying to create the conditions for peace when there is a terrorist group embedded in Gaza that does not want to see you exist, that is a very difficult challenge.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Senator, go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You gave a major speech to AIPAC, which obviously deals with the Middle East crisis, and you barely mentioned the Palestinians.",0,1,0,0,1,1
"And I think, again, it is a complicated issue and God knows for decades presidents, including President Clinton and others, Jimmy Carter and others have tried to do the right thing.",0,0,0,0,0,1
All that I am saying is we cannot continue to be one-sided.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are two sides to the issue.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Secretary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to take another quick, quick break.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But much more on the CNN Democratic presidential debate live from Brooklyn, New York.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is coming up right after this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Welcome back to the CNN presidential debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're here in Brooklyn.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary, Senator, both of you talk about major reforms to college tuition, health care, and Social Security, all of which will take significant changes from Congress, currently controlled by Republicans.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Senator Sanders, you're promising health care and free college for all, and those plans would be met with both political and practical challenges.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says your initiatives would cost up to $28 trillion and, even after massive tax increases, that would add as much as $15 trillion to the national debt.",0,0,0,1,1,1
How is this fiscally responsible?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I disagree with that study.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are many economists who come up with very, very different numbers.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"For example, we are the only country, major country on Earth, that does not guarantee health care to all people, and yet we end up spending almost three times what the British do, 50 percent more than the French.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"My proposal, a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program, will save...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... will save middle-class families many thousands of dollars a year in their health care costs.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Public colleges and universities tuition free?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Damn right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is exactly what we should be doing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'd pay for that -- I'd pay for that by telling Wall Street that, yeah, we are going to have a tax on Wall Street speculation, which will bring in more than enough money to provide free tuition at public colleges and universities and lower the outrageous level of student debt.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Wolf, we have seen in the last 30 years a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 0.1 percent.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"The establishment does not like this idea, but, yes, I am determined to transfer that money back to the working families of this country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary, go ahead and respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, again -- again, I absolutely agree with the diagnosis, the diagnosis that we've got to do much more to finish the work of getting universal health care coverage, something that I've worked on for 25 years.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Before there was something called Obamacare, there was something called Hillarycare.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And we're now at 90 percent of coverage; I'm going to get us to 100 percent.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And with respect to college, I think we have to make college affordable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are pricing out middle-class, working, and poor families.",0,0,0,0,1,1
There's no doubt about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I do think when you make proposals and you're running for president, you should be held accountable for whether or not the numbers add up and whether or not the plans...",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
... are actually going to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And just very briefly, on health care, most of the people who have analyzed what Senator Sanders put out -- remember, he had a plan for about, I don't know, 18, 20 years.",0,0,0,0,1,1
He changed in the middle of this campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He put out another plan.,0,0,1,0,0,0
People have been analyzing the new plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And there is no doubt by those who have analyzed it, progressive economists, health economists, and the like, that it would pose an incredible burden, not just on the budget, but on individuals.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"In fact, the Washington Post called it a train-wreck for the poor.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"A working woman on Medicaid who already has health insurance would be expected to pay about $2,300.",0,0,0,0,1,1
The same for free college.,0,1,0,0,0,0

So let's continue the conversation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Kasich, I know you don't like to talk about Donald Trump.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you say that the American government is stupid, that the Mexican government is sending criminals, that we're being bamboozled, is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Chris, first of all, I was just saying to Chris Christie, they say we're outspoken, we need to take lessons from Donald Trump if we're really going to learn it.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Donald Trump is hitting a nerve in this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's hitting a nerve.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Now, he's got his solutions.",0,0,0,0,1,0

"You know, look, I balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when I was in Washington.",0,0,0,0,1,0

But the point is that we all have solutions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump is touching a nerve because people want the wall to be built.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They want to see an end to illegal immigration.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"They want to see it, and we all do.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"All right, well, Senator Rubio, let me see if I can do better with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid, their leaders are smart, and all of these illegals coming over are criminals?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Let me set the record straight on a couple of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"They're coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority.,0,0,0,0,1,1
I also believe we need a fence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And that's why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But I agree with what Governor Kasich just said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People are frustrated.,0,0,0,1,0,0
This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration.,0,0,0,0,1,1

"We feel like despite our generosity, we're being taken advantage of.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they've paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can't get in.",0,0,1,1,1,1

"Other than politics, could you explain why in the last two years you've changed your position on a path to citizenship, and are there other past positions that we shouldn't hold you to?",0,0,0,0,0,0

"You know, there was reference made to our leaders being stupid.",0,0,0,1,0,0
It's not a question of stupidity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's that they don't want to enforce the immigration laws.,0,0,0,1,0,1

It doesn't mean that you don't do everything possible to try to fulfill your obligations.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And I think that's an important distinction, that under Roe v. Wade we've had enshrined under our Constitution.",0,0,0,0,1,1
You had said you think there is room for some restrictions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So is it fair to say that women don't always have a full right to choose?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, under Roe v. Wade that is the law.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"And as I said, I support the reasoning and the outcome in Roe v. Wade.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Where the distinction comes in is the health of the mother.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I have seen what happens when governments make these decisions, whether it was forced sterilization, forced abortion in China, or force childbearing in communist Romania.",0,0,1,1,0,1

The nomination is won on the floor in Cleveland by the majority of delegates that get empowered and by the vote of the people.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"So the voters in these states, their votes end up causing delegates to be bound to candidates, and those delegates will have to vote for those candidates on the floor.",0,0,0,1,1,1
There's no way around it.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"You know, one of the things that I think has been a misconception is that somehow, the rules of 2012 will apply to the 2016 election.",0,0,0,1,0,1

Is that fair?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is that fair?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, the delegates, there's two parts of the process.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One is you've got to get the delegate allocation, meaning when you win the state, you're allocated a certain amount of delegates.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Donald Trump has 33 delegates in Tennessee.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And they're bound to Donald Trump, not just for one vote, but in Tennessee, they're actually bound for two votes.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And nothing can change that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, the selection of delegates, who's in those seats is something that happens at the state party level and these campaigns have to have serious operations in the states, and they have to make sure that those people do their best job in getting their own, the people they want, to be in those seats.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So it doesn't just happen automatically.,0,0,0,0,0,0

And one last question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Considering we're going to have an open convention, you have three candidates fighting for delegates and worried about who those people are.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Should the RNC be in charge of the V.P.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I mean, we certainly are equipped with our research team to do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that's another interesting question.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And that's a subject no one's really talking about, is that that's another vote on the floor that the delegates choose.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And so while I'm sure, obviously, the choice of whoever the nominee is going to be important, it's still up for a vote of the delegates.",0,0,0,0,0,0

So they're not going to beat him.,0,0,1,1,0,0
The only way he gets beat is if he internally collapses and if his supporters morally collapse because of bad defeats in places like California and New York.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"They're like Oklahoma at the end of the Villanova game, there's nothing there.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Or I feel as if though something changed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, you look at what's happening on the ground, in the technical parts of this, right, where you have Tennessee party chair making sure he's putting party operatives into the delegate spots, even in the Trump seats, that they're at least seeding this so that they can stop Trump if they have the opportunity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's where Republicans are right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They get to decide if they wanna have a civil war if Trump wins, or a civil war if Trump loses.",0,0,0,1,0,0
There is no winner out of this whole fight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So he can either come into Cleveland with the amount of delegates.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"He loses Wisconsin by a big amount, I don't think he's going to be able to make that up.",0,0,1,1,0,0
Or he’ll be very close.,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is how it works.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Reince isn’t incorrect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The delegates select who the president is.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But there are going to be a whole bunch of Republicans very upset about it, even people who didn't vote for Donald Trump, because they see, as you pointed out, is this fair?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Is this fair?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is going to just split this party apart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And anybody who thinks that Donald Trump is just going to go away if he loses this like, ""Oh, well, he's not going to be able to get on a ballot,"" he's got Twitter and he's got cable TV.",0,0,0,1,0,0

We'll be right back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
***COMMERCIAL BREAK***,0,0,0,0,0,0
Welcome back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One of the reasons the Republican establishment has the jitters over Donald Trump is the worry that having Trump at the top of the ticket will hurt the party's chances of keeping control of the house and the Senate.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"My next guest, Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson is up for reelection in November and does face a tough fight to hold onto his seat in a swing state that has gone blue more often than not.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Senator Johnson, welcome back to Meet the Press.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Morning, Chuck.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How are you doing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm pretty good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me ask you straight up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you going to say who you're voting for on Tuesday?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you going to endorse before Tuesday?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have not endorsed.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"You know, I've certainly stated my intention to support whoever the Republican nominee is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've got to have faith in Wisconsin primary voters as well as American - or the Republican primary voters on a national level.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So that's my intention.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's interesting you put it that way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you plan on supporting the candidate who wins the primary on Tuesday in Wisconsin?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think that's the most appropriate action?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, again, what I will do is I will support whoever the delegates in the national convention actually chooses for a nominee.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've got three and a half months to go here before that's actually determined.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, three and a half months is a lifetime in politics.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So nobody can predict exactly how this is going to turn out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, you’ve been - it's been surprising to hear from you as compared to some of your other fellow Republican senators who are running for reelection in swing states.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're one of the few that says publicly that you think Donald Trump helps you in your reelection, that he doesn't hurt you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think what I've been talking about is, you know, from my standpoint, I'm a businessperson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm a completely outsider.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that certainly is what has resonated about his campaign in many respects.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, you know, from my standpoint, I think what this campaign ought to be about is, you know, growth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How do you grow our economy?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's the number one component for a solution.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think what candidates are finding out here in Wisconsin is we have some very discerning primary voters here on the Republican side.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And like Charles mentioned, a lot has to do with our exceptional talk radio hosts across the state.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think some of the candidates found out exactly exceptional they really are in terms of asking tough questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's really what elections are about, and sort of primaries about, is getting out the truth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, by saying what you said, you're all but implying you're not for Trump.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You're all but implying by essentially praising how great these conservative radio can be, how do we not interpret that as an anti-Trump sentiment coming from you?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Because I'm saying what I'm saying.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not endorsing somebody.,0,0,1,1,0,0
That obviously speaks for itself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The last primary, I did endorse Mitt Romney, and I'll tell you why I endorsed Mitt Romney, it's why I met with him beforehand, he said, ""Ron, I expect to be a one-term president, because I'm going to fix these problems.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And then when he picked Paul Ryan as a running mate, it just confirmed that my choice was correct.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So obviously, I don't have a comfort level.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, let's face it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
No two people agree on everything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'll tell you what, though, is certain, is I will never vote for Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders or whoever the Democrat nominee may be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So again, I'm looking, and I've got to put my faith and trust in Republican primary voters, and I intend to support the Republican nominee, whoever that person may or may not be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me ask you this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What advice would you give Donald Trump to improve his chances in Wisconsin?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, we've got polling that shows he trails Hillary Clinton by ten points.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton are tied in Wisconsin.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And John Kasich actually leads her.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if Trump's the nominee, what advice would you give Donald Trump to improve his standing in Wisconsin?",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's the same advice I'd give anybody in a primary or a general election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Show your vision for America, for Wisconsin, and certainly in a Republican primary, show the primary voters how you intend to take that vision to defeat the Democratic nominee.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's face it, we're going to be facing either a socialist, I think we should all remember that socialism isn't hasn't worked.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not in the Soviet Union, not in Venezuela, certainly not in what should be the island paradise of Cuba.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Hillary Clinton has so much baggage, you know, she's going to be a very flawed candidate if she ends up being selected.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Alright, final question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Merrick Garland, the President's choice for the Supreme Court vacancy, you said something interesting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You said, you implied that if this were a Republican president filling a conservative seat, this would go through without a problem.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I guess my question to you is if Merrick Garland were replacing a liberal seat on the court, would you be more inclined to see this nomination and confirmation process go forward?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I think what Vice President Biden said in 1992 is pretty accurate.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"In such a politicized atmosphere, with just a couple, literally eight months before an election, let the American people have a voice in choosing the direction of the Supreme Court when they're choosing the direction of the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Under any circumstance?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't think Supreme Court nominations should happen in a final year of a presidency in a presidential election year ever?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it's pretty problematic.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And particularly with the Judge Garland in Wisconsin here, he appears to be pretty hostile to Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms, which would not be popular in Wisconsin.",0,0,0,1,1,1
So I'm doing my job in protecting the Second Amendment rights of Wisconsinites by just withholding my consent.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Alright.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Ron Johnson, Republican from Wisconsin up for reelection.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thanks for coming on the show, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thanks for having me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You got it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll be back in 45 seconds with our endgame segment and the Democrats.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why can't Hillary Clinton put away Bernie Sanders?,0,0,0,1,0,0
***COMMERCIAL BREAK***,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're back with endgame.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want you to listen to something Bernie Sanders said Thursday.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(BEGIN TAPE),0,0,0,0,0,0
We have won six out of the last seven caucuses.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Most of them by landslide victories.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think that, uh, superdelegates should listen to the will of their people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you get 60, 70, 80 percent of the vote in a state, you know what, I think superdelegates should vote for us.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(END TAPE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we decided to crunch the numbers on that basis to see how much it would benefit Senator Sanders, if all of the superdelegates in states he's won so far chose him.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So take a look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, looking at states where people have voted so far, the current superdelegate count in those states is Clinton, with 253 versus Sanders with just 25 superdelegates, with some superdelegates still undecided.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"If those superdelegates vote the way their states have voted so far, then they would divide this way: Clinton would actually increase her lead a little bit, increase her total to 260, Bernie Sanders would get to 124, because some of those undecideds that were in there would be allocated to help Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But those numbers just show you, Hillary Clinton still would lead with superdelegates too.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"He doesn't have a path, does he?",0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, this race is, it's still going on, and it's important for Hillary Clinton to remain engaged.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I give Bernie Sanders a lot of credit from starting from zero and getting to where he is right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's an impressive-- and he's made this debate about his issues and he's made her fight on his turf.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That said, the delegate math is not going to add up and it's not working.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But when you compare where Democrats are to where Republicans are, Democrats are having a skirmish right now.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Republicans are in thermonuclear war, okay?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"It is not-- so it's a little bit messy, and so it's going to be a little harder for her, and maybe it's not over until June.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But they are going to be united, Democratic partisans right now like Bernie Sanders as much as they like Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They are not going to have a problem unifying the party in the way Republicans are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, David-- go ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Alright, let me just say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think Wisconsin's going to be good for Bernie Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's expected to win there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is not going to be 2008 though for Hillary Clinton where she got clobbered by double digits.,0,0,1,0,1,0
This could be a single-digit win.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But everybody knows that Bernie Sanders needs a big win.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you talked about April 5th, 1960, John F. Kennedy, you know, coming out of Wisconsin, getting some legitimacy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But think about it, April 5th, 1910, Wisconsin, I should say Milwaukee, was the first major American city, key word there major American, to have and elect a socialist mayor.",0,0,0,0,1,1
They've done it three times.,0,0,0,0,1,0
So that's good news.,0,0,0,0,0,0
For Bernie Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
For Bernie Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Former socialist mayor of Burlington .,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But David, why--",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think he voted in that election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, come on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Boy, you are just going to make everybody mad, aren't you?",0,0,0,0,0,0
But Hillary Clinton is struggling to close out this nomination.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Let's call it what it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She is struggling to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Amy's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is a skirmish.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is not this-- but if there wasn't a Republican fight, we'd be going, ""What's going on here?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Why can't she close the deal?""",0,0,1,0,0,0
"If Donald Trump didn't exist, we would all be talking about how she is the most unpopular nominee in recent American history.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"She would be that, instead Donald Trump is that.",0,0,0,1,0,0
There happens to be this other guy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What strikes me is there are two motivations for voters.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There's philosophy, and Sanders sort of has that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But there's also party loyalty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was watching your interview with her earlier.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I was thinking, ""If Ed Muskie or Hubert Humphrey came back and they saw her, they'd thought, “That's what a Democratic candidate looks like.'""",0,0,0,0,0,0
Or-- and sounds like.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so she's part of the party, the embodied history of the party.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so there's a machine-like quality, it's hard to get super excited by her, but there's a comfort level for Democratic voters.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's carrying her, but it doesn't inspire.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was also struck though during your interview with Hillary, with Senator Clinton, on your questions about abortion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you guys spent a lot of time during that interview, about four to five minutes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's something you don't do very often with Democratic candidates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, you don't.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But she answered you and she went back and she had history and she had precedent to cite, and she talked about third world, uh, other countries she went through.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And then I started imagining you doing that interview with Donald Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And where he gets that, when he's with Chris Matthews, and he gets that deer-with-his-eyes-caught look in his face, where you see he's grappling for an answer and he's out of his depth and he's not sure how he's going to answer it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think what this week and what happened with Donald Trump played the beneficiary of this the most I think is Hillary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because if ever there was, like, you had, like, a sort of, an edging out the differences between candidates, she's the one who I think is the winner.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I wonder, the more clarity, it's funny.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This week, this was the first time you thought, ""Boy, she could really--"" you could see how she's going to match up pretty well with Donald Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Republican delegates are going to see that Amy, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, they haven't seen it yet.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Right, but they're gonna--",0,0,0,1,0,0
This is really the most fascinating thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There have been polls out now for a long time that showed that he has problems with women.,0,0,0,1,1,0
That shows that he has problems with pretty much every single demographic group.,0,0,0,1,1,0
And yet--,0,0,0,0,0,0
Except white men.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Except for white men.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And yet, it has not impacted him in these primaries.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"In fact, I went back and I looked at this point in 2012, almost 40 percent of Republicans said beating Obama was their top priority and they voted for Mitt Romney.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Today, 13 percent of Republicans say that electability is their top issue.",0,0,0,0,1,1
It's not about beating Hillary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is about putting the candidate that they think represents their values better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's where Trump and Cruz fit the bill.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But this is how they ended up losing in 2012.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"That's how we get back to, now we're moving towards a general election.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now we're starting, you know, what we've seen so far are these two, these two, in these two, primaries the people on the left and the people on right.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Charles, let me ask you this, you get the final comment on this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Who's going to have an easier time coming together, this sort of a polarized Democratic electorate in Wisconsin or a polarized Republican electorate in Wisconsin?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the Democrats have an easier time coming together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, they both are looking pretty good, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and I think at the end of the day, we saw it last night.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They had the founders party for the Democrats.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You could have called it the unity party-- the unity, uh--",0,0,0,0,0,0
They didn't fight that much?,0,0,0,0,0,0
They really didn't fight that much.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So I think they'll be able to come together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, thank you all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Charles, thanks for coming down.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you for having me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You've got to get out of here, because I know, you've got some more work to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's all we have for today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll be back next week.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because as you know, if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press.",0,0,0,0,0,0

No president can easily commit our sons and daughters to war.,0,0,0,1,0,0
We can and will succeed because our mission is clear and our troops are strong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can hear you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The rest of the world hears you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The Commander-in-Chief Forum, live from the Carrier Intrepid in New York.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Here now is Matt Lauer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Good evening, everyone.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The decisions a commander-in- chief makes can have a profound and lasting impact on all Americans, but none more so than the brave men and women who serve, fight, and die for our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What makes tonight’s forum unique, some of the questions will be asked by U.S. military veterans who are in our audience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The presidential nominees will appear back-to-back tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"After a coin toss yesterday won by Mr. Trump, he chose to go second.",0,0,1,0,0,0
So that means we begin tonight with the Democratic nominee for president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Matt, how are you?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Good to see you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hi.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How are you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Good to have you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Nice to see you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Good evening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m happy you’re doing this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me — thank you very much, I’m happy to be here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me ask you something ahead of time that I’ll ask Mr. Trump in a half an hour.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"To the best of your ability tonight, can we talk about your qualities and your qualifications to be commander-in-chief and not use this as an opportunity to attack Mr. Trump, all right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I’ll ask him the exact same thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that’s an exactly right way to proceed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a very important decision for our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And each of us should be presenting our experience, our expertise, and our plans to protect and defend the United States and our allies around the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What is the most important characteristic that a commander-in-chief can possess?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Steadiness.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"An absolute rock steadiness, and mixed with strength to be able to make the hard decisions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because I’ve had the unique experience of watching and working with several presidents.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And these are not easy decisions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If they were, they wouldn’t get to the president in the first place.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And when you’re sitting in the Situation Room, as I have on numerous occasions, particularly with respect to determining whether to recommend the raid against bin Laden, what you want in a president, a commander-in-chief, is someone who listens, who evaluates what is being told to him or her, who is able to sort out the very difficult options being presented…",0,0,0,0,0,0
You’re talking about judgment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
… and then makes the decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Makes the decision, that’s right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So judgment is a key.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Temperament and judgment, yes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The word “judgment” has been used a lot around you, Secretary Clinton, over the last year-and-a-half, and in particular concerning your use of your personal e-mail and server to communicate while you were secretary of state.",0,0,0,1,0,0
You’ve said it’s a mistake.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Mm-hmm.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You said you made not the best choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You were communicating on highly sensitive topics.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why wasn’t it more than a mistake?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Why wasn’t it disqualifying, if you want to be commander-in- chief?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Matt, first of all, as I have said repeatedly, it was a mistake to have a personal account.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would certainly not do it again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I make no excuses for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was something that should not have been done.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"But the real question is the handling of classified material, which is I think what the implication of your question was.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And for all the viewers watching you tonight, I have a lot of experience dealing with classified material, starting when I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee going into the four years as secretary of state.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Classified material has a header which says “top secret,” “secret,” “confidential.” Nothing — and I will repeat this, and this is verified in the report by the Department of Justice — none of the e-mails sent or received by me had such a header.",1,0,1,1,1,1
"Were some of the e-mails sent or received by you referring to our drone program, our covert drone program?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, because — of course, there were no discussions of any of the covert actions in process being determined about whether or not to go forward.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"But every part of our government had to deal with questions, and the secretary of state’s office was first and foremost.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So there are ways of talking about the drone program…,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
And you said you thought your communications on that were fairly routine?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me say, the FBI just released their report about their investigation, they discussed drone matters in the unclassified section of their report.",0,0,1,1,1,1
But Director Comey also said this after reviewing all the information.,0,0,0,0,1,1
He said there is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Well, Matt, I just respectfully point to the hundreds of experienced foreign policy experts, diplomats, defense officials who were communicating information on the unclassified system because it was necessary to answer questions and to be able publicly to go as far as we could, which was not acknowledging the program.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But I would be in Pakistan, as I was on several occasions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There might very well have been a strike.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would be asked in a public setting, in an interview, about it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It was known to have happened.,0,0,0,1,1,1
We had to have an answer that did not move into classified area.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we handled that appropriately.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You mentioned you’re in Pakistan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Some of the e-mails you sent and received happened while you were overseas.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And Director Comey also said that while they have no proof, we assessed that it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail accounts.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Matt, there is no evidence.",0,0,1,1,0,1
Of course anything is possible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what is factual is the State Department system was hacked.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Most of the government systems are way behind the curve.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We’ve had hacking repeatedly, even in the White House.",0,0,0,0,1,0
There is no evidence my system was hacked.,0,0,1,1,1,0
Let us bring in Hallie Jackson of NBC News who’s been covering this campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She’s getting questions from our veterans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hallie, who are you with?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hi, Matt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m with Lieutenant Jon Lester (ph), who will stand with me here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He began his military career by enlisting in the Air Force and then switched over to the Navy before he retired, where he flew P-3 Orions in Desert Storm and in Desert Shield.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"He’s a Republican, and he has this question for you, Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, thank you very much for coming tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As a naval flight officer, I held a top secret sensitive compartmentalized information clearance.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And that provided me access to materials and information highly sensitive to our warfighting capabilities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Had I communicated this information not following prescribed protocols, I would have been prosecuted and imprisoned.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"Secretary Clinton, how can you expect those such as myself who were and are entrusted with America’s most sensitive information to have any confidence in your leadership as president when you clearly corrupted our national security?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, I appreciate your concern and also your experience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me try to make the distinctions that I think are important for me to answer your question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, as I said to Matt, you know and I know classified material is designated.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It is marked.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There is a header so that there is no dispute at all that what is being communicated to or from someone who has that access is marked classified.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And what we have here is the use of an unclassified system by hundreds of people in our government to send information that was not marked, there were no headers, there was no statement, top secret, secret, or confidential.",0,0,1,1,0,1
I communicated about classified material on a wholly separate system.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I took it very seriously.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I traveled, I went into one of those little tents that I’m sure you’ve seen around the world because we didn’t want there to be any potential for someone to have embedded a camera to try to see whatever it is that I was seeing that was designated, marked, and headed as classified.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Let us…,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I did exactly what I should have done and I take it very seriously, always have, always will.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sir, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much for your question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, let’s talk about your vote in favor of the war in Iraq.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You’ve since said it was a mistake.,0,0,0,1,1,0
Mm-hmm.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obviously, it was not something you said you would do again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I asked before for people to raise their hand if you served in Iraq.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you do it again?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How do you think these people feel when the person running to be their commander-in-chief says her vote to go to war in Iraq was a mistake?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Look, I think that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And I have said that my voting to give President Bush that authority was, from my perspective, my mistake.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I also believe that it is imperative that we learn from the mistakes, like after- action reports are supposed to do, and so we must learn what led us down that path so that it never happens again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think I’m in the best possible position to be able to understand that and prevent it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I will say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m asking to be judged on the totality of my record, what I’ve done for our veterans as first lady, as senator, what I’ve done for Gold Star Families, working with them to increase the death benefit from $12,000 to $100,000, working with Republicans, like Lindsey Graham, to get TRICARE for our National Guard members who didn’t have health care unless they were deployed, working to provide more support for the care of our veterans, those who are wounded, working with the Fisher family, now into the third generation of caring for our fallen heroes, working with John McCain to raise money for Brooke Medical Center’s Intrepid Center to take care of those who are coming back with profound injuries, working on TBI and PTSD and so much more, working with groups to end veteran suicide, like TAPS.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So, yes…",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m going to get on to that subject in a second.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There was — there was a mistake.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, my opponent was for the war in Iraq.",0,0,1,1,0,0
He says he wasn’t.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can go back and look at the record.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He supported it.,0,1,0,0,1,0
He told Howard Stern he supported it.,0,1,0,0,1,0
"So he supported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening, and he is on record as supporting it after it happened.",0,0,1,0,1,0
I have taken responsibility for my decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me go to another…,0,0,0,0,0,0
He refuses to take responsibility for his support.,0,0,0,0,1,0
That is a judgment issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me go to another question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hallie?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"(OFF-MIKE) who served in the Air Force for nearly a decade, where she was an intelligence specialist, specializing in countering violent extremism.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Like you, Secretary Clinton, she’s a Democrat and she has this question for you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, to your point, you have had an extensive record with military intervention.",0,0,0,0,1,0
How do you respond to progressives like myself who worry and have concerns that your hawkish foreign policy will continue?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And what is your plan to end wasteful war campaigns in which our peers, servicewomen and men, continue to be killed and wounded?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I assume you’re talking about Iraq, because of my vote, and you probably are talking about Libya, because of the role that I played in the administration’s decision about whether to take on Gadhafi.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But before I get to that, let me say very clearly: I view force as a last resort, not a first choice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will do everything in my power to make sure that our men and women in the military are fully prepared for any challenge that they may have to face on our behalf.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I will also be as careful as I can in making the most significant decisions any president and commander-in-chief can make about sending our men and women into harm’s way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With respect to Libya, again, there’s no difference between my opponent and myself.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He’s on record extensively supporting intervention in Libya, when Gadhafi was threatening to massacre his population.",1,0,0,1,1,1
"I put together a coalition that included NATO, included the Arab League, and we were able to save lives.",0,0,0,0,1,0
We did not lose a single American in that action.,0,0,1,0,1,0
And I think taking that action was the right decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not taking it, and permitting there to be an ongoing civil war in Libya, would have been as dangerous and threatening as what we are now seeing in Syria.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I’m going to jump in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much for your question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me ask you about the Iran nuclear deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was signed under Secretary Kerry; it was begun under you.,0,0,0,0,1,1
You started those talks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right, I did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have said you expect the Iranians to cheat, you think they’ll buy time, and perhaps stay along their course to building a nuclear weapon.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"If they cheat, Secretary Clinton, will you have any course of action other than a military course of action?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Would you enter into negotiations with again (ph)?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Would you go back to economic sanctions knowing they cheated and are then closer to a nuclear weapon?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Matt, look, let me put this in context, because this is one of the most important strategic questions we face.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I became secretary of state, the Iranians were on a fast track to acquiring the material necessary to get a nuclear weapon.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That had happened the prior eight years.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"They mastered the nuclear fuel cycle, they built covert facilities, they stocked them with centrifuges, and they were moving forward.",0,0,0,0,1,1
What was our decision?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our decision was to try to put together an international coalition that included Russia and China to exert the kind of pressure through sanctions that the United States alone could not do.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"Right, but you’ve said that you think they’re going to cheat…",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, wait, let me — look, this is an important issue.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I know we’re on TV and we don’t have a lot of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to get to a lot of questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will talk quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I want people to understand this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, yes, I put together the coalition.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We imposed the sanctions.,0,0,1,0,1,0
We got them to the negotiating table.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And after I left, we got the agreement.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That agreement put a lid on their nuclear weapons program and imposed intrusive inspections.,0,0,1,1,1,1
I have said we are going to enforce it to the letter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think they’re playing us?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the nuclear issue, no.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I think we have enough insight into what they’re doing to be able to say we have to distrust but verify.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I am focused on is all the other malicious activities of the Iranians — ballistic missiles, support for terrorists, being involved in Syria, Yemen, and other places, supporting Hezbollah, Hamas.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"But here’s the difference, Matt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would rather as president be dealing with Iran on all of those issues without having to worry as much about their racing for a nuclear weapon.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we have made the world safer; we just have to make sure it’s enforced.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hallie?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m with Kenneth Anderson (ph).,0,0,0,0,0,0
He’s one of our undecided voters here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He considers himself an independent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He earned the rank of sergeant in the Marine Corps, where he was an Arabic translator during three tours in Iraq.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Kenneth, you have a question for Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, Secretary Clinton, last October you said that surveys of veterans show that they’re overall satisfied with their treatment and that the problems with the V.A.",0,0,0,0,1,1
aren’t as widespread as they’re made out to be.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So do you think the problems with the V.A.,0,0,0,0,0,0
have been made to seem worse than they really are?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Look, I was outraged by the stories that came out about the V.A.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have been very clear about the necessity for doing whatever is required to move the V.A.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"into the 21st century, to provide the kind of treatment options that our veterans today desperately need and deserve.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that’s what I will do as president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I will not let the V.A.,0,0,0,0,0,0
be privatized.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And I do think there is an agenda out there, supported by my opponent, to do just that.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I think that would be very disastrous for our military veterans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I’m going to do everything I can — I’m going to have a meeting every week in the Oval Office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to bring the V.A.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"people, we’re going to bring the DOD people, because we’ve got to have a better fit between getting mustered out and getting into the V.A.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"system, sometimes — and you probably know this, Sergeant — I’ve met so many vets who get mustered out, who leave the service, they can’t find their records from DOD, and those records never make it to the V.A.",0,0,1,0,1,1
They feel like they’re living in a funhouse.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They have to go over the same things over and over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re living in a technological world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You cannot tell me we can’t do a better job getting that information.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so I’m going to focus on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m going to work with everybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m going to make them work together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I’m going to jump in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we’re going to fix the problems in the V.A.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sergeant, thank you very much for your question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let’s talk about veterans and suicide.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, let’s, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It’s an alarming, alarming story.",0,0,0,1,0,0
The population of veterans has a rate of suicide far above the general population.,1,0,0,0,1,1
Twenty — twenty suicides a day.,1,0,0,0,1,0
What are you going to do to stop it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, this month is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I’ve spent a lot of time with family members, survivors, who’ve lost a loved one after he or she came home, sometimes suffering from PTSD or TBI or sexual assault, being handed bags of opioids, not being given an appropriate treatment to help that particular person, which is something, to go back to the sergeant’s question, we have to change.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So I rolled out my mental health agenda last week, and I have a whole section devoted to veterans’ mental health.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we’ve got to remove the stigma.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’ve got to help people currently serving not to feel that if they report their sense of unease, their depression, that somehow it’s going to be a mark against them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to do more about addiction, not only drugs, but also alcohol.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I have put forth a really robust agenda, working with a lot of the VSOs and other groups, like TAPS, who have been thinking about this and trying to figure out what we’re going to do to help our veterans re-enter civilian life and live full, productive lives.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Hallie?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m with Ernie Young.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Come on up here with me, a former Army captain, who led troops during tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan.",0,0,0,0,0,1
He’s an independent voter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you have a question for the secretary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, as an Army veteran, a commander-in- chief’s to empathize with servicemembers and their families is important to me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The ability to truly understand implications and consequences of your decisions, actions, or inactions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"How will you determine when and where to deploy troops directly into harm’s way, especially to combat ISIS?",0,0,0,1,0,0
As briefly as you can.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to defeat ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is my highest counterterrorism goal.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And we’ve got to do it with air power.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ve got to do it with much more support for the Arabs and the Kurds who will fight on the ground against ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to squeeze them by continuing to support the Iraqi military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They’ve taken back Ramadi, Fallujah.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They’ve got to hold them.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They’ve got to now get into Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’re going to work to make sure that they have the support — they have special forces, as you know, they have enablers, they have surveillance, intelligence, reconnaissance help.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They are not going to get ground troops.,0,0,1,1,0,1
We are not putting ground troops into Iraq ever again.,0,0,0,1,1,0
And we’re not putting ground troops into Syria.,0,0,0,1,1,0
We’re going to defeat ISIS without committing American ground troops.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So those are the kinds of decisions we have to make on a case-by-case basis.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, remember, when I became secretary of state, we had 200,000 troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And I’m very grateful that we have brought home the vast majority of those.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have a residual force, as you know, in Afghanistan.",0,0,1,0,0,1
We have built up several thousands of the folks that I’ve talked about who are assisting in the fight against ISIS.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But it is in our national security interest to defeat ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I intend to make that happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much for your question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as part of it, we’re going after Baghdadi, the leader, because it will help us focus our attention, just like going after bin Laden helped us focus our attention…",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Secretary Clinton, I am fast running out of time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to get to one of the concerns just about everybody in this country, and that is terror attacks on our soil.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Either directed by ISIS or inspired by ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Would your message as the next president of the United States or potential next president be to Americans that we simply are living in the reality that those attacks will happen?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And can you guarantee people that after four years of a Clinton presidency, they will be safer on the streets of San Bernardino or Boston than they are today?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Matt, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that that’s the result.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m not going to, you know, promise something that I think most thinking Americans know is going to be a huge challenge, and here’s why.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ve got to have an intelligence surge.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’ve got to get a lot more cooperation out of Europe, out of the Middle East.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to do a better job of not only collecting and analyzing the intelligence we do have, but distributing it much more quickly down the ladder to state and local law enforcement.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We also have to do a better job combating ISIS online, where they recruit, where they radicalize.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And I don’t think we’re doing as much as we can.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to work with Silicon Valley.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to work with our experts in our government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have got to disrupt, we have got to take them on in the arena of ideas that, unfortunately, pollute and capture the minds of vulnerable people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we need to wage this war against ISIS from the air, on the ground, and online, in cyberspace.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And here at home, for goodness’s sakes, we have to finally pass a law prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in the United States of America.",0,0,1,1,0,1
So we’ve got work to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know we can do that work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m meeting with a group of terror experts, counterterrorism experts.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But I want to just say one additional thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve got 30 seconds left.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Matt Olsen, the former director of the National Center on Counterterrorism, has a great article out today saying the last thing we need to do is to play into the hands of ISIS.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Going after American Muslims, defaming a Gold Star family, the family of Captain Khan, making it more difficult for us to have a coalition with Muslim majority nations…",0,0,0,0,1,1
And we tried to have an agreement…,0,0,0,0,0,0
… that is not going to help us to succeed in defeating ISIS and protecting our American homeland.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Secretary Hillary Clinton, thank you very much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you so much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Too short a time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to take a break.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We’re going to have much more with her competitor, Donald Trump, right after this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You’re watching NBC News special, the Commander-in-Chief Forum.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"We welcome you back now to this NBC News special, the Commander-in-Chief Forum.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Tonight we’re speaking with the two major party presidential nominees to find out where they stand on the critical issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, please welcome the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
Good to see you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Matt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much for joining us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You heard me say to Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and it didn’t completely work out toward the end there, as much as possible I’d like you to tell our veterans and our people at home why you are prepared for the role of commander-in-chief and try to keep the attacks to a minimum.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’ve had a year of that and maybe 60 more days of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To a minimum, absolutely.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK, perfect.",0,0,0,0,0,0
To a minimum.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I guess that’s a question of definition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I guess.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Any time you interview a president, sitting or past president, they will tell you that the most daunting…",0,0,0,0,0,0
Was I supposed to answer this question?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, no, I mean just keep the attacks to a minimum.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Any time you talk to a president, they’ll tell you the most daunting part of the job is the role of commander-in-chief.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What have you experienced in your personal life or your professional life that you believe prepares you to make the decisions that a commander-in-chief has to make?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I’ve built a great company.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve been all over the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve dealt with foreign countries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’ve done very well, as an example, tremendously well dealing with China and dealing with so many of the countries that are just ripping this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They are just taking advantage of us like nobody’s ever seen before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I’ve had great experience dealing on an international basis.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I look today and I see Russian planes circling our planes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re taunting us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I see in Iran, I see the boats taunting our ships, our destroyers, and I think…",0,0,1,0,0,1
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
But what have you done in your life that prepares you to send men and women of the United States into harm’s way?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think the main thing is I have great judgment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have good judgment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know what’s going on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve called so many of the shots.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I happened to hear Hillary Clinton say that I was not against the war in Iraq.,0,1,0,0,1,0
I was totally against the war in Iraq.,1,1,0,0,1,0
From a — you can look at Esquire magazine from ’04.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You can look at before that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I was against the war in Iraq because I said it’s going to totally destabilize the Middle East, which it has.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"It has absolutely been a disastrous war, and by the way, perhaps almost as bad was the way Barack Obama got out.",0,0,1,1,0,0
That was a disaster.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"People talk about you and commander-in-chief, and not just Secretary Clinton, but some of your Republican opponents in the primary season, and they wonder about your temperament.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They say, does Donald Trump have the temperament to be commander-in-chief?",0,0,0,0,0,0
You said something recently that I found interesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You admitted that sometimes in the heat of a debate or when you’re talking about a lot of issues you say things that you later regret.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So can we afford that with a commander-in-chief — to have a commander-in-chief who says things that he later regrets?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, when you say regret, yeah, sure, I regret.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in the meantime, I beat 16 people and here I am.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"So, you know, to a certain extent there is a regret.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would have liked to have done it in a nicer manner.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I had 16 very talented people that I had to go through.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that was a lot of people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But when you say…,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That was a record, Matt.",0,0,1,0,0,0
That was a record in the history of Republican politics.,0,0,1,0,1,0
I was able to get more votes than anybody ever has gotten in the history of Republican politics.,1,0,0,0,1,1
But when you say inflammatory things… (CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"… in a presidential campaign, it’s different than saying them when you’re commander-in-chief.",0,0,0,0,0,0
If you say things you regret…,0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"… when you’re commander-in-chief, you can spark a conflict, you can destabilize a region, you can put American lives at risk.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Can we afford to take that risk with you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think absolutely.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think if you saw what happened in Mexico the other day, where I went there, I had great relationships, everything else.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I let them know where the United States stands.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, we’ve been badly hurt by Mexico, both on the border and with taking all of our jobs or a big percentage of our jobs.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And if you look at what happened, look at the aftermath today where the people that arranged the trip in Mexico have been forced out of government.",0,0,1,1,1,1
That’s how well we did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Back in August…,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that’s how well we’re going to have to do, Matt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Back in August, when you admitted that you regret some of the things you said, you also said this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
“I can promise you this: I will always tell you the truth.”,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s true.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So let me read some of the things you’ve said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
“I know more about ISIS than the generals do.,0,0,0,1,1,0
Believe me.” Was that the truth?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the generals under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have not been successful.",0,0,1,1,0,0
ISIS…,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you know more about ISIS than they do?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I think under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the generals have been reduced to rubble.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They have been reduced to a point where it’s embarrassing for our country.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"You have a force of 30,000 or so people.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Nobody really knows.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But probably 30,000 people.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And I can just see the great — as an example- General George Patton spinning in his grave as ISIS we can’t beat.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We had the greatest…,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, you’ve said if we had MacArthur today or if we had Patton today, we would not have ISIS, that the rise of these military commanders that we have today, they come up the chain of command, and by the time they get to the top, they’re too politically correct.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And we know that’s not a compliment coming from you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Have you lost faith in the military commanders?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have great faith in the military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have great faith in certain of the commanders, certainly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I have no faith in Hillary Clinton or the leadership.,0,0,0,1,0,0
You look at what’s happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, when she comes in and starts saying, oh, I would have done this, I would have — she’s been there for 30 years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, we need change, Matt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to have it, and we have to have it fast.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let’s go to Hallie Jackson in our crowd.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hallie?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m with Phillip Clay (ph), who was a public affairs officer in the Marine Corps.",0,0,0,0,0,1
He spent a year in Anbar province in Iraq.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"He left the military with the rank of captain, service that inspired him to write a book.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He’s a Democrat, and he has this question for you, Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, over the past 15 years, a lot of U.S. troops have bled and died securing towns and provinces from Iraq to Afghanistan, only to have insurgent groups like ISIS spring back the moment we leave.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Now, you’ve claimed to have a secret plan to defeat ISIS.",0,0,0,1,1,0
But you’re hardly the first politician to promise a quick victory and a speedy homecoming.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So assuming we do defeat ISIS, what next?",0,0,0,0,0,0
What is your plan for the region to ensure that a group like them doesn’t just come back?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, part of the problem that we’ve had is we go in, we defeat somebody, and then we don’t know what we’re doing after that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We lose it, like as an example, you look at Iraq, what happened, how badly that was handled.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And then when President Obama took over, likewise, it was a disaster.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It was actually somewhat stable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t think could ever be very stable to where we should have never gone into in the first place.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But he came in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He said when we go out — and he took everybody out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And really, ISIS was formed.",1,0,1,1,0,0
This was a terrible decision.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And frankly, we never even got a shot.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"And if you really look at the aftermath of Iraq, Iran is going to be taking over Iraq.",0,0,0,1,0,1
They’ve been doing it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And it’s not a pretty picture.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The — and I think you know — because you’ve been watching me I think for a long time — I’ve always said, shouldn’t be there, but if we’re going to get out, take the oil.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn’t have ISIS, because ISIS formed with the power and the wealth of that oil.",0,1,1,1,0,1
How were we going to take the oil?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How were we going to do that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just we would leave a certain group behind and you would take various sections where they have the oil.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They have — people don’t know this about Iraq, but they have among the largest oil reserves in the world, in the entire world.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And we’re the only ones, we go in, we spend $3 trillion, we lose thousands and thousands of lives, and then, Matt, what happens is, we get nothing.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"You know, it used to be to the victor belong the spoils.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, there was no victor there, believe me.",0,0,0,1,0,0
There was no victor.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But I always said: Take the oil.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One of the benefits we would have had if we took the oil is ISIS would not have been able to take oil and use that oil…,0,0,1,1,1,0
Let me stay on ISIS…,0,0,0,0,0,0
… to fuel themselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me stay on ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we’ve met in the past and we’ve talked, you say things like I’m going to bomb the expletive out of them very quickly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when people like me press you for details like that gentleman just said on what your plan is, you very often say, I’m not going to give you the details because I want to be unpredictable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The word is unpredictable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But yesterday, you actually told us a little bit about your plan in your speech.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You said this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Quote, “We’re going to convene my top generals and they will have 30 days to submit a plan for soundly and quickly defeating ISIS.” So is the plan you’ve been hiding this whole time asking someone else for their plan?",0,0,0,1,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when I do come up with a plan that I like and that perhaps agrees with mine, or maybe doesn’t — I may love what the generals come back with.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will convene…,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you have your own plan?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I want to be — I don’t want to — look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a very substantial chance of winning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Make America great again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to make America great again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a substantial chance of winning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I win, I don’t want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan is.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But you’re going to…,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And let me tell you, if I like maybe a combination of my plan and the generals’ plan, or the generals’ plan, if I like their plan, Matt, I’m not going to call you up and say, “Matt, we have a great plan.” This is what Obama does.",0,0,0,0,0,0
“We’re going to leave Iraq on a certain day.”,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you’re going to convene a panel of generals, and you’ve already said you know more about ISIS than those generals do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, they’ll probably be different generals, to be honest with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, I’m looking at the generals, today, you probably saw, I have a piece of paper here, I could show it, 88 generals and admirals endorsed me today.",0,0,1,0,1,1
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s a numbers game.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hillary Clinton claims more numbers.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Well, it’s not really — it’s not — yeah, numbers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
People that have been losing for us for a long period of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, the fact is, we have had the worst and you could even say the dumbest foreign policy.",0,0,1,1,0,0
Our results are so bad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We would have been better off had we never, ever spent $2 in that part of the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You recently — you recently received two intelligence briefings.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Yes, I did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Did anything in that briefing, without going into specifics, shock or alarm you?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Very much so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did you learn new things in that briefing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I have great respect for the people that gave us the briefings.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We — they were terrific people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They were experts on Iraq and Iran and different parts of — and Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, yes, there was one thing that shocked me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it just seems to me that what they said President Obama and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, who is another total disaster, did exactly the opposite.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"Did you learn anything in that briefing — again, not going into specifics — that makes you reconsider some of the things you say you can accomplish, like defeating ISIS quickly?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I didn’t learn anything from that standpoint.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I did learn is that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts and our truly — when they call it intelligence, it’s there for a reason — what our experts said to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Hallie?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I was very, very surprised.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In almost every instance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I could tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have pretty good with the body language.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I could tell they were not happy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Hallie?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m with former Army Captain Sue Fulton, who was a member of the First West Point class to include women.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She served as a signal corps officer in Germany.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"She’s a Democrat, and she has this question for you, Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hi, thank you very much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you believe that an undocumented person who serves — who wants to serve in the U.S. armed forces deserves to stay in this country legally?,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think that when you serve in the armed forces, that’s a very special situation, and I could see myself working that out, absolutely.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So she’s saying has already served in the armed forces or wants to serve, plans to serve?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Plans to serve.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Plans to serve in the armed forces.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As you know, under DACA, we already have people who are undocumented who are serving.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I think military is a very special thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If they plan on serving, if they get in, I would absolutely hold those people — now, we have to be very careful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to vet very carefully.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Everybody would agree with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the answer is, it would be a very special circumstance, yes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you very much for your question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hallie, you have another one?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Alex Gronkowski (ph) was an Army staff sergeant assigned in special operations.,0,0,0,0,0,1
He was stationed at Fort Bragg and was deployed to Afghanistan and other places across the Middle East.,0,0,1,0,1,1
He has not decided who he will vote for yet in November.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you have a question for Mr. Trump.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, as you know, tensions between the United States and Russia have been at the highest level since the Cold War.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"In your first 120 days of presidency, how would you de-escalate the tensions?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And more importantly, what steps would you take to bring Mr. Putin and the Russian government back to negotiating table?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think I would have a very good relationship with many foreign leaders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it’s very sad, when you look at Barack Obama, as an example, lands Air Force One in China, and they don’t want to put out stairs to get off the plane.",1,0,1,1,0,1
And he has to use the stairs that mechanics use to get up and down to fix the plane.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They wouldn’t give him stairs.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think it’s very sad, when he lands in Saudi Arabia, and he lands in Cuba, and there aren’t high officials to even greet him.",0,0,1,0,0,1
This is the first time in the history — the storied history of Air Force One.,0,1,0,0,1,1
"I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Putin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think I would have a very, very good relationship with Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As I said, take a look today.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look at what happened with their fighter jets circling one of our aircraft in a very dangerous manner.,0,0,1,1,0,1
Somebody said less than 10 feet away.,0,0,0,0,0,1
This is hostility.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I saw, just two or three days ago, they looked like they were not exactly getting along, but I looked at President Obama and Putin staring at each other.",0,0,0,0,0,1
These were not two people that were getting along.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, the beautiful part of getting along, Russia wants to defeat ISIS as badly as we do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we had a relationship with Russia, wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could work on it together and knock the hell out of ISIS?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Wouldn’t that be a wonderful thing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me ask you about some of the things you’ve said about Vladimir Putin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You said, I will tell you, in terms of leadership, he’s getting an A, our president is not doing so well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when referring to a comment that Putin made about you, I think he called you a brilliant leader, you said it’s always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his country and beyond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, he does have an 82 percent approval rating, according to the different pollsters, who, by the way, some of them are based right here.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Look, look…",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He’s also a guy who annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine, supports Assad in Syria, supports Iran, is trying to undermine our influence in key regions of the world, and according to our intelligence community, probably is the main suspect for the hacking of the DNC computers…",0,0,1,1,1,1
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, nobody knows that for a fact.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But do you want me to start naming some of the things that President Obama does at the same time?,0,0,0,0,0,0
But do you want to be complimented by that former KGB officer?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think when he calls me brilliant, I’ll take the compliment, OK?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The fact is, look, it’s not going to get him anywhere.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m a negotiator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to take back our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You look at what’s happening to our country, you look at the depleted military.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You look at the fact that we’ve lost our jobs.,0,0,1,0,1,0
We’re losing our jobs like we’re a bunch of babies.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"We’re going to take back our country, Matt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The fact that he calls me brilliant or whatever he calls me is going to have zero impact.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"But the fact that you say you can get along with him, do you think the day…",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think I’d be able to get along with him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do you think the day that you become president of the United States, he’s going to change his mind on some of these key issues?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Possibly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s possible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don’t know, Matt.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It’s possible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it’s not going to have any impact.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If he says great things about me, I’m going to say great things about him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’ve already said, he is really very much of a leader.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, you can say, oh, isn’t that a terrible thing — the man has very strong control over a country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, it’s a very different system, and I don’t happen to like the system.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But certainly, in that system, he’s been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a divided country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We have a country where you have Hillary Clinton with her e-mails that nobody’s ever seen where she deletes 33,000 e-mails, and that’s after getting a subpoena from Congress.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"If you do that in private business, you get thrown in jail.",0,0,0,1,1,0
Hallie?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Steve Korea (ph), here with me, was in the Army Reserves and spent 10 months in Iraq right at the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom.",0,0,0,0,0,1
He is a Republican and has this question for you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Good evening, Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Hi.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I like what you say about supporting veterans and how they’re important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I haven’t heard what the actual plans are to continue that support beyond words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How do you translate those words to action after you take office?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I love that question, because I’ve been very close to the vets.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You see the relationship I have with the vets just by looking at the polls.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, today a poll came out.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And my relationship has been very good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have a very, very powerful plan that’s on my website that you possibly saw.",0,0,0,0,0,0
One of the big problems is the wait time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Vets are waiting six days, seven days, eight days.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And by the way, Hillary Clinton six months ago said the vets are being treated essentially just fine, there’s no real problem, it’s over-exaggerated.",1,0,0,0,1,1
She did say that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, she went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the V.A.",0,0,0,1,0,1
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I mean, she made up half of the things she said about me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m telling you, this is — she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, under my plan, if you’ve got to wait — and, by the way, people are dying on line.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"They’re dying, waiting, waiting to get to see a doctor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They’re waiting five days and six days.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Under a part of my plan, if they have that long wait, they walk outside, they go to the local doctor, they choose the doctor, they choose the hospital, whether it’s public or private, they get themselves better.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"In many cases, it’s a minor procedure or a pill or just a prescription.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they end up dying because they can’t get to see the doctor.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We will pay the bill.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They go outside, they get a doctor, they get a prescription, they do what they have to do, and we pay the bill.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"That is something that I have been praised — and, by the way, I never said take the V.A.",0,0,0,0,1,0
— take the Veterans Administration private.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I wouldn’t do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Too much respect for our people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would never do that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I heard it was said that I said that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would not do that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I do believe — I do believe, when you’re waiting in line for six, seven days, you should never be in a position like that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You go out, you see the doctor, you get yourself taken care of.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hallie, you’ve got another question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Rachel Fredericks (ph), who specialized in aviations operations in the Marine Corps, serving stateside, she lost two friends to suicide.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And you now struggle yourself with PTSD.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She’s a Republican, but leaning towards you, still undecided a little bit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Rachel, you have a question for Mr. Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, I wanted to ask what your plan will be to stop 20 veterans a day from killing themselves.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And actually it’s 22.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it’s almost impossible to conceive that this is happening in our country, 20 to 22 people a day are killing themselves.",0,0,1,1,1,1
A lot of it is they’re killing themselves over the fact that they can’t — they’re under tremendous pain and they can’t see a doctor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to speed up the process.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to create a great mental health division.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They need help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They need help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They need tremendous help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we’re doing nothing for them.,0,0,0,1,0,0
The V.A.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"is really almost, you could say, a corrupt enterprise.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"If you look at what’s going on, as an example, Matt, in Arizona, where they caught people stealing, and they can’t even do anything about it, they can’t even fire the people.",0,0,1,1,1,1
So we are going to make it efficient and good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if it’s not good, you’re going out to private hospitals, public hospitals, and doctors.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hallie, one more?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Donald Day (ph) here, who served as a radio operator in the Marine Corps in the Vietnam era.",0,0,0,0,0,1
He had tours of duty in Southeast Asia and in Europe.,0,0,0,0,0,1
He’s also a Democrat and has this question for you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Trump, I have a daughter who is interested in joining the service, but when she researched the military, she saw the stats on sexual assault and decided not to go.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I have a concern about the rape of women in our armed forces.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"As president, what specifically would you do to support all victims of sexual assault in the military?",0,0,0,0,0,0
It’s a great question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it’s a massive problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The numbers are staggering, hard to believe, even.",0,0,0,0,1,1
But we’re going to have to run it very tight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I at the same time want to keep the court system within the military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don’t think it should be outside of the military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we have to come down very, very hard on that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And your daughter is absolutely right, it is a massive problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have to do something about that problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the best thing we can do is set up a court system within the military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, the court system practically doesn’t exist.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It takes too long.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 2013, on this subject, you tweeted this, quote, “26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military, only 238 convictions.",0,1,1,1,1,1
What did these geniuses expect when they put men and women together?”,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it is — it is — it is a correct tweet.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are many people that think that that’s absolutely correct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we need to have a…,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
So this should have been expected?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And does that mean the only way to fix it is to take women out of the military?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it’s happening, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, by the way, since then, it’s gotten worse.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, not to take them out, but something has to be happen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"You have reported and — the gentleman can tell you, you have the report of rape and nobody gets prosecuted.",0,1,1,1,1,1
There are no consequence.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"When you have somebody that does something so evil, so bad as that, there has to be consequence for that person.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have to go after that person.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, nobody’s doing anything.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Look at the small number of results.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, that’s part of the problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So many of the issues that we’ve talked about with you, Mr. Trump, tonight, and Secretary Clinton, are so complex that even career military people and career diplomats and politicians have trouble getting their arms around them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You’ve had a very different background, in business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So nobody would expect you to have taken over the last 20 years really deep dives into some of these issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I’m curious about what you’re doing now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What kind of research are you doing now?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What kind of homework are you doing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What kind of things are you reading as you prepare for the day in two months where you might be elected the next president of the United States?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, in the front row, you have four generals.",0,0,0,0,1,1
You have admirals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have people all throughout the audience that I’m dealing with.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Right here is a list that was just printed today of 88 admirals and generals that I meet with and I talk to.,0,0,0,0,1,1
How much time are you spending on this?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’m also — a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I’m doing a lot of different things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Don’t forget, we’re running a big campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re doing very well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m also, you know, and I’m very much giving it to my children and my executives to run, I’m also partially running a business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I’m campaigning, I’m running a business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve got a lot of hats right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we’re doing very well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in the meantime, I am studying.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I’m meeting constantly — you see — you see General Flynn and you see some of the folks that we have, and they’re scattered throughout the audience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we have admirals, we have generals, we have colonels.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a lot of people that I respect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think I’ve learned a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think, also, I certainly — I really feel I have a common sense on the various issues that you’re talking about, Matt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You said in the speech today, you said history shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is the greatest.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And we’re not prepared.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Will you be prepared on day one, if you’re elected president of the United States, to tackle these complex national security issues?",0,0,0,0,0,0
One hundred percent.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Hey, Matt, again, she made a mistake on Libya.",0,0,0,1,0,0
She made a terrible mistake on Libya.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And the next thing, I mean, not only did she make the mistake, but then they complicated the mistake by having no management once they bombed you know what out of Gadhafi.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"I mean, she made a terrible mistake on Libya.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And part of it was the management aftereffect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that we have great management talents, great management skills.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you are prepared?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have to tell you — totally prepared.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But remember this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I found this subject and these subjects of interest all of my life, Matt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This hasn’t been over the last 14 months.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I’ve found these substantiates of tremendous interest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That’s why they were asking me about Iraq 14 years ago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They were asking me these questions.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They don’t ask businesspeople those questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me end in kind of the same place I started.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Have you given much thought, Mr. Trump, if you’re elected president and commander-in-chief, to that moment where you’re going to have to make that first decision that puts American men and women in harm’s way?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it’s the most difficult decision you can possibly ever make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You’re talking about death.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we’re talking death to not just our side.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re talking death all over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would be very, very cautious.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think I’d be a lot slower.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She has a happy trigger.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You look, she votes for the wars, she goes in Libya…",0,0,1,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Have you thought about personally the emotional burden of that moment?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it’s a tremendous burden.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think there is no greater burden that anybody could have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I’ve been preparing this for a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, my theme is make America great again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to make America great again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, Matt, we’ve also got to make America strong again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And right now, we are not strong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Believe me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a depleted military.,0,0,1,0,1,0
We have the greatest people in the world in our military.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But it is very sadly depleted.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"The Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Thank you, Matt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
We’re going to be much — we’ll be back with much more from the Intrepid carrier on this Commander-in-Chief Forum right after this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"There’s a lot of people we want to thank for making tonight a success, the presidential nominees themselves, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We want to thank the many veterans in our audience for their questions and, most importantly, for their service.",0,0,0,0,0,0

We hope you’ll tune in for that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And more importantly, we hope you get out and vote this November.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nothing could be more important.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Live from The George Washington University in the nation's capital, this is CNN's debate night on the future of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm Jake Tapper.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm Dana Bash.,0,0,0,0,0,0
President Trump has made the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act one of his top priorities.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"To certain members of our audience, that legislation has been a life-saver.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"To others, it has harmed livelihoods.",0,0,0,0,0,1
These defenders and supporters of Obamacare will get to question two leading members of Congress who will shape what comes next.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, please welcome the runners-up for the Democratic and Republican nominations for president, in their first debate, Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont...",0,0,0,0,0,1
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"... and Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(APPLAUSE),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senators, welcome.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Please take your positions behind the podiums.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, before your opening statements, I want to talk about the ground rules that you both agreed to.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You will get 90 seconds to answer questions posed to you, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Timing lights will guide you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As we mentioned, a handful of members of our audience, which include both critics and defenders of the Affordable Care Act, will question you, in addition to questions from Jake and myself.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"As moderators, we will guide the debate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we will begin with two-minute opening statements on what should happen to health care in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me begin by thanking CNN for sponsoring this debate and let me thank all of those who are watching.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me get right to the point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Cruz, like most Republicans, has said that he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or so-called Obamacare.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Let me tell you what that will mean to the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It means that if you are one of 20 million Americans who finally has received health insurance, forget about it, you're gone.",0,0,0,0,1,1
You're off health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that means when you get sick, you ain't going to be able to go to the doctor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when you end up in the hospital, you'll be paying those bills for the rest of your life, or maybe you'll go bankrupt.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"What the repeal of the ACA means, that if you are one of 10 million senior citizens who today is struggling with the outrageous cost of prescription drugs, your prescription drug costs are going to go up on average about $2,000.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"What the repeal of the ACA means is that if you are suffering with cancer, with diabetes, with serious mental illness, you will be put into a position where you may be rejected from any insurance at all, because you have a pre-existing condition.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And by the way, women are considered a pre-existing condition by the insurance companies because they might have a baby.",1,0,0,0,0,1
Is the ACA perfect?,0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody believes that it is.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And nobody believes that we do not need to improve it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the debate is whether we kill it entirely or we make improvements in it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will tell you:  Overwhelming majority of the American people say do not simply repeal the ACA.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Make improvements.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Last point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right.,1,0,0,0,1,1
I believe we should move in that direction.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The ACA has been a step forward.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"We have got to go further and join every other major country on Earth and say that if you are an American, you are guaranteed health care as a right, not a privilege.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator Sanders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Cruz, what should happen with health care in America?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Dana, I think I get an opening statement, as well, so I'll start with that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Please.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Which is just simply saying thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, guys, for hosting this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you for Bernie for joining this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And thank you to CNN for hosting this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, often in politics we have debates that are sound bites, that are 60 seconds or 90 seconds on a topic, and I appreciate CNN devoting real time to this issue, because it matters.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Health care is personal in a way that is different from most other political issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Health care affects our families.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's our moms.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Health care is our kids.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It can quite literally be whether we live or die.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And this is an issue where Bernie Sanders and I have fundamentally different approaches.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Bernie and the Democrats want government to control health care.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I trust you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I trust your doctors.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think health care works better when you're in charge of your family's health care decisions, when you can sit down with your doctor and decide the care that's best for your family without government setting rules, without government rationing, without wait periods.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the fundamental divide we're having.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, six years ago, when Obamacare was being adopted, it's possible that reasonable minds could have differed on whether this was a good idea.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Number one, most infamously, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
President Obama said that 37 different times.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"As 6 million people across this country discovered, that was not true when they had their plans canceled against their wishes.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, millions discovered that wasn't true.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"And President Obama promised the American people the average family's premiums would drop $2,500.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Not only wasn't that true, but the average family's premiums have risen $5,000.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"That's why people are unhappy with this disaster of a law, because it's driven up the cost of health care, it's reduced your choice, it's reduced your freedom, and this last election was a referendum on Obamacare, and the American people quite rightly decided this plan isn't working.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Senator Cruz, thank you so much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have a lot of questions for both of you from members of the audience, but before we get to them, I want to ask about a pressing matter on Capitol Hill, and I'll start with you, Senator Cruz.",0,0,0,0,0,0
House Speaker Paul Ryan said today that the legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare would be done this year.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"On Sunday, President Trump said that a plan may not be rolled out until 2018.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Not that it would, but that it may not be rolled out until 2018.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Is anything less than a full and swift repeal and replacement of Obamacare a broken promise?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Listen, I think everyone agrees there is an urgency to honor the promises we made.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, since Obamacare was passed, we've had multiple elections, 2010, 2014, 2016, where the number-one issue in each of those elections was Obamacare.",0,0,1,0,1,1

"Now, that's not true, and we're going to get into that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that was the argument that was made to the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And 2010, 2014, 2016 I believe were a mandate from the voters.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They said we're tired of premiums going up.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We're tired of deductibles going up.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We're tired of losing our doctors of less choices.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, yes, should Congress move swiftly to repeal Obamacare?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Absolutely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, nobody thinks we're done once Obamacare is repealed.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Once Obamacare is repealed, we need commonsense reform that increases competition, that empowers patients, that gives you more choices, that puts you in charge of your health care, rather than empowering government bureaucrats to get in the way.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And these have been commonsense ideas, I would note, that for six years Republicans have been proposing, and for six years Democrats have been fighting, saying no changes at all to Obamacare, even as people were hurting and losing their coverage.",0,0,0,1,1,1
This election is about honoring the promises we made to the people who elected us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the truth is that the Republicans are now in a panic, because the American people have caught on that the absolute repeal of Obamacare without improvements in it, without a plan to make it better, would be an absolute disaster.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"So when Ted talks about giving people choice, here's your choice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You got cancer, and you go to the doctor, and the insurance company says, ""We're not going to cover it.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We can't make money on you because you have cancer.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You have a pre-existing condition.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
And here's another choice you can have if we get rid of Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you have diabetes, and you're spending a whole lot on health insurance, the insurance companies will say, sorry, we're only going to spend X dollars, because we've got to make money off you.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That's the function of private insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, do we have to improve the Affordable Care Act?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course we do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let us remember where we came from.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Before the Affordable Care Act, as Ted probably knows, if you were a family of four during the eight years under George Bush, your premiums doubled.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So it's not like, oh, gee, just in America today, health care costs are going up.",0,0,0,0,1,1
They went up much higher before we had the Affordable Care Act.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Senator Cruz, do you want to respond to that?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, it is interesting to hear so much of the Democratic rhetoric that government controlling your health care is always justified by saying the insurance companies are terrible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, this is an example of what John Adams famously said, facts are stubborn things.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Let's talk about some facts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 2008, the 10 largest insurance companies in America made just over $8 billion profit.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"In 2016 -- 2015, rather -- those same 10 largest companies made $15 billion in profit.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Insurance company profits have doubled under Obamacare.,0,1,1,0,1,1
That was the result.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Bernie helped write Obamacare.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't think the federal government ought to be passing a law that doubles insurance company profits and, while those profits were doubling, what happened to the average American family?",0,0,1,1,1,1
"The average American family, your premiums have gone up $5,462.",0,1,0,0,1,1
"At the same time, the average deductible has gone up $5,000.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"For families that are struggling, you're getting less coverage, you're paying more for it, and your deductibles are higher, and you know who's making out like gangbusters?",0,0,0,0,1,1
The insurance companies and those in government whose solution is let's have even more government control.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator...,0,0,0,0,0,0
This thing isn't working.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I find myself in agreement with Ted.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The function of insurance companies is not to provide quality health care to all people.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It's to make as much money as they possibly can.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Ted, let's work together on a Medicare for all, single-payer program, so we're finally going to get insurance companies, private insurance companies out of our lives.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"As you know, as the American people know, we are the only major country on Earth that allows private insurance companies to run the system.",0,0,0,0,1,1
But it's not only the points that Ted made about the insurance companies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What he forgot to tell you, even adding insult to injury, is many of these CEOs of the insurance companies make outrageous compensation and get all of these severance packages, in some cases over $100 million.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Ted, let's work together.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to get those insurance companies out of health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We'll move to a Medicare for all health care program, guaranteeing health care to all people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Thank you, Senators.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Unless you want to agree to a single- payer system...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I would love to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
You're not going to support that.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, actually, what I will say, Bernie, is I would love for us to work together going after big pharma, and in particular taking on the FDA.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, it takes $2 billion to approve a new drug.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Now, I've introduced legislation to reform the FDA process so that new health care -- so that we can be curing diseases and we can be helping people.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I would encourage you to join me in that legislation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll tell you what...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Join me in right to try, so that if someone has a terminal disease, the government won't tell them, you can't try this life- saving medicine because we forbid it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gentlemen, we could do this all night.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to get to pharma.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm willing to look at it, if you are willing to look at taking on pharma, which is the greediest of many greedy corporate interests in Washington.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And I'll tell you what, I'm going to introduce legislation to have Medicare negotiate prices with the pharmaceutical industry.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I'm going to introduce, again, legislation to allow Americans to buy less expensive medicine in Canada, the U.K., and other countries.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Let's take on the greed of pharma, substantially lower prescription drug prices.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And, Dana, let me make a response to this, because this is a good discussion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The whole point of having an extended discussion is to say, as you know, with drug re-importation, bringing in drugs from Canada and other countries, just a couple of weeks ago, on the Senate floor, I voted with you...",0,0,0,0,1,1
"You voted for my amendment, that's correct.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"... in support of that, in support of allowing drug re- importation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It was the right thing to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I'll tell you, a much bigger barrier than that is the fact that, you know, in the last 20 years, the FDA has approved only three child cancer drugs?",0,0,1,1,1,1
"In 20 years, because the burdens are so great.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I introduced legislation that said if a drug is approved in another major country, if it's approved in Europe or Japan or our major respected partners, that the FDA has got 30 days to approve it here.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We shouldn't be telling people with life-threatening diseases you can't do everything you can to save your lives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That would be a great thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator...,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'd make news if you and I joined up on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We'll need to look at it, but that is not the major problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The major problem with the pharmaceutical industry is, you know what, they could double or triple the prices you pay for medicine tomorrow...",0,0,1,1,1,1
Senator Sanders...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... and there is no legislation to control that.,0,0,0,1,1,0
Senator Sanders...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hi, Dana, how are you?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, hi.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
Good to see you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So good to see you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We do want to talk more about that later, but I want to get to some of the questions from our audience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of the most popular parts of Obamacare is -- as you mentioned earlier, requiring insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"If Obamacare is repealed, 52 million Americans could lose that guaranteed coverage because of their medical histories.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"One of them is Neosho Ponder, who is fighting breast cancer and currently undergoing radiation treatment.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Neosho?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Cruz, if Obamacare is repealed, is there anything you can do to ensure that provisions are in place so that half of my paycheck won't be spent on health care?",0,0,0,0,0,1
I didn't ask for cancer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I never smoked; I never drank a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I lived a pretty healthy lifestyle.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I fear that -- I fear that if I don't have Obamacare, if I'm not covered, then my pre-existing condition of breast cancer and remaining treatments will make it difficult for me to afford insurance.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Senator Cruz, what can you do to protect people like me who are alive because of Obamacare?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Neo, thank you for asking that question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And how long -- how long have you been diagnosed with breast cancer?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was diagnosed on April 25, 2016.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wow, well, you're doing great.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, our prayers are with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'll tell you, my mom had breast cancer, and -- and my mom was diagnosed in 2000.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I sat by her hospital bed as she went through two surgeries, and it's a horrible disease, but 16 years later, thank God, she is a survivor.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I will tell you, our medical innovation has been incredible dealing with breast cancer.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So all of us -- our prayers and thoughts are with you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, you asked about people who get sick and not wanting your insurance canceled, not wanting your premiums to go up, that's absolutely right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is absolutely right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you look at every proposal that's been submitted, every significant proposal that's been submitted to replace Obamacare, to fix the problems in the health care system after Obamacare is gotten rid of, all of them protect people in your situations.",0,0,0,0,1,1
All of them prohibit insurance companies from canceling someone because they got sick.,0,0,1,1,1,1
They prohibit insurance companies from jacking up the insurance rates because they got sick or injured.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Look, the whole point of insurance is none of us know if we're going to wake up tomorrow, like you did earlier last year, and discover we have a terrible disease.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And we buy insurance, we pay our premiums, just so we know that we'll be able to take care of that situation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So, absolutely, we've got to fix it, and I'm confident that we're going to.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, response?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, I cannot believe what you just said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's in direct contradiction to everything you ran for president on.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"What Ted has said is, he wants to get rid of all federal mandates.",0,0,1,0,1,0
Did you say that a hundred times?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn't say it once.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I will -- said Ted Cruz, I will get rid of every word of Obamacare.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The only way that we are going to make sure that you -- and we all wish you the best -- are able to get the health insurance you need with a pre-existing condition is to make sure that no insurance company in this country can say no to you or to anybody else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, Ted thinks that's a terrible government intrusion.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I think it is the moral and right thing to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, when you hear Ted and other Republicans say we're going to get rid of all of -- we're going to leave it to the states.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, what do you think the states are going to do?",0,0,0,0,0,0
You think they're going to maintain the ability to protect people with pre-existing conditions?,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're not.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We're going to go back to the obscenity of where we were before Obamacare was passed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Cruz, your response.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then could you just clarify, will you support anything that doesn't mandate people with pre- existing conditions continue to have coverage?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, my response is, I said hundreds of times on the campaign trail, yes, we should repeal every word of Obamacare.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"But if you listen to the next sentence, I always said, we're not done yet with health care reform, and we do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need health care reform.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the principles of health care reform, they should expand competition, they should empower patients, and they should keep government from getting between you and your doctor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I talked about all sorts of commonsense ideas to do just that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as I said, a proposal that is consistent in virtually every one of the pieces of Republican legislation that's been filed is a prohibition on insurance companies canceling people because they got sick.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And, you know, Bernie, it's easy to say to people, gosh, you're going to lose your coverage.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What do the Democrats say to the 6 million people who had their health insurance canceled?,0,0,0,0,1,0
What...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Ted, Ted, you're a good lawyer, and you use words well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What you just said is ""cancel your insurance.""",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Cancel your insurance, OK?",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what happens if tomorrow you wake up and you go to the doctor and you discover that you have cancer?,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You just discovered it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the insurance companies say, hey, you're not a good deal for us, we can't make money off of you, you will not get that health insurance.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"So I think when people like Ted talk about repealing Obamacare, repealing government mandates -- this is a government mandate, and it is a damn good mandate and a humane mandate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, Senator Cruz, if you would answer Neosho's specific question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, I did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Multiple times, Dana.",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So you are saying that she will continue to have health care...,0,0,0,0,1,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
... she and others who have pre-existing conditions?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And,0,0,0,0,0,0
you're going to make sure that that is a mandate and a requirement in whatever legislation you support?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I've said is, is virtually all of the Republican legislation that has been filed that the Democrats have opposed maintains a continuity of coverage so that insurance companies can't cancel policies.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"And, you know, the question I asked a minute ago that Bernie chose not to answer is, what do the Democrats say to the 6 million people who had their insurance policies canceled, who got a notification in the mail that you don't get to see your doctors anymore?",0,0,1,0,1,0
And not just the people who were canceled.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are people all over this country who can't afford health insurance because of Obamacare, who the deductibles are so high, the premiums are so high, they say, you know what, my family, we can't make it on this?",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And, you know, you talk about the people covered by Obamacare.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's something most people don't know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Most of the people covered by Obamacare are on Medicaid.,1,0,0,0,1,1
They jammed a bunch more people on Medicaid.,0,0,1,1,1,0
And I'll tell you what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People on Medicaid have markedly worse health outcomes than people with private insurance.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Senator, we're going to get to these issues...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would like to see a lot more people on private insurance, able to be insured for health care...",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to get to these issues of Medicaid and others....,0,0,0,0,0,0
... rather than -- but it's relevant to -- he's saying people are going to lose their health care.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"If you want health care, we want as many people as possible to be able to afford insurance policies that protect you when you get sick.",0,0,0,0,0,1
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to just -- very briefly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you listen carefully to what he's saying, if you go to the doctor tomorrow, and you are diagnosed with a terrible illness, the insurance companies do not have to provide you insurance.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That is what Ted said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What he also said, if you have an illness, it has to be kept.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"But really, we are moving into an era where millions of people who develop terrible illnesses will not be able to get insurance.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And God only knows how many of them will die.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, Senator Sanders, you just heard Senator Cruz bring up an issue that a lot of Americans have out there, especially a lot of middle-class Americans, who say that the Affordable Care Act has made it so that their insurance is unaffordable.",0,0,0,0,1,1
One of them is in our audience right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Her name is Melissa Borkowski.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's a nurse practitioner from Florida.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She is a mother of four.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She and her husband are paying more than $1,000 a month to insure their family for a plan with a $13,000 deductible.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Melissa?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Good evening, Senators.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you for your time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As you said, I'm a nurse practitioner.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've worked in health care for over 25 years now.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But under Obamacare, I'm not able to get the health services I need for myself or my family.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Last year, I had a very abnormal pap smear and needed additional tests.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"But our plan has a $13,000 deductible before it will cover anything, so I wasn't able to afford to get those tests done.",0,0,1,1,1,1
So now I sit here wondering if I have an undiagnosed cancer that will eventually take me away from my four children.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My plan premiums plus deductible cost over $25,000 for the year and it covers little more than basic preventative services.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Senator Sanders, my question is, why should we, my family, be forced to pay so much money for an insurance plan that is essentially useless and doesn't do anything for me?",0,0,0,1,0,1
Pam...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Melissa.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Melissa, I'm sorry.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Melissa, you ask a great question, and the answer is, it is totally absurd.",0,0,0,1,0,0
It is totally absurd.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the real question we should be asking -- Melissa is talking about an outrageous deductible, right?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So it prevents you from going to the doctor when you should be going.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The real question, which is never talked about or very rarely talked about, is why we end up spending as a nation twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, if you were in Canada, you know what, you would get the health care that you needed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you were in the U.K., France, Germany, Scandinavia, you would get the health care you need as a right of being a citizen in this country.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"The idea that we have policies like that, like the one you describe, is clearly an outrage and should tell every American that we've got to join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people as a right.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And when we do that, by the way, for a vast majority of the American people, their family incomes will go up.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Senator Cruz?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Melissa, I'm sorry for the challenges you're facing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are many people in America struggling with exactly what you are, in the wreckage of Obamacare, with skyrocketing premiums, with deductibles that are unaffordable, and with really limited care.",1,0,1,1,0,1
And I will commend Bernie for his candor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, his view all along was that we need government-run and government-controlled health care for everyone.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And indeed, as he's said here tonight, he thinks other countries do it a lot better than America.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"He often points to Canada, the United Kingdom, he says why do we pay more?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, there's a reason we pay more than those countries.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We get a lot more and a lot better health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me give you some basic facts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As I noticed in all the Democratic primary debates, there was no discussion of the facts on the other side.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The United States, population controlled, delivers three times as many mammograms as Europe, two-and-a-half times the number of MRI scans, and 31 percent more C sections.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We provide more health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I talk to doctors in Vermont, all over this country, and what they tell me, patients come into their offices very, very sick.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Let's now turn to the effects of Obamacare on small businesses, and with us to discuss is LaRonda Hunter, who owns five hair salons in Texas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
LaRonda?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hello.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under the controls of Obamacare, my business has been restricted from expansion.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"I'm from Fort Worth, Texas.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I own five Fantastic Sams hair salons.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We employ between 45 and 48 employees.,0,0,0,0,1,1
My original plan was to open more salons and employ more people.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"However, under Obamacare, I am restricted, because I -- it requires me to furnish health insurance if I employ more than 50 people.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Unfortunately, the profit margin in my industry is very thin.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"And I'm not a wealthy person, so it's impossible for me to grow my business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"My question to you, Senator Sanders, is how do I grow my business?",0,0,0,0,0,0
How do I employ more Americans without either raising the prices to my customers or lowering wages to my employees?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ronda?,0,0,0,0,0,0
LaRonda.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"LaRonda, OK.  You own five salons?",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's correct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you employ close to 50 people?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just under.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what kind of health insurance do you provide for them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't -- none.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You provide no health insurance to them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Correct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me be -- let me give you an answer you will not be happy with, and that is I think that for businesses that employ 50 people or more, given the nature of our dysfunctional health care system right now, where most people do get their health insurance through the places that they work, I'm sorry, I think that in America today, everybody should have health care.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And if you have more than 50 people, you know what, I think -- I'm afraid to tell you -- I think you will have to provide health insurance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So my question is, how do I do that without raising my prices to my customers or lowering wages to my employees?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You see, the difficulty is also is -- and I'm not much of an expert on hairdressing in general, and certainly in Fort Worth...",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm just one of small businesses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But my guess is, one of the problems that we have is there may be somebody else in Fort Worth who is providing decent health insurance to their employees, and they are in an unfair competitive situation regarding you.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"You can compete and maybe charge lower prices, get business, while they on the other hand may be providing decent health insurance.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I don't think that's that...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you'll find in profit margin in my entire industry...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"I certainly don't know, you know, about hair salons in Fort Worth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I do believe, to be honest with you, that if you have more than 50 people, yes, you should be providing health insurance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Cruz?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"LaRonda, thank you for sharing your story, and it's good to see",0,0,0,0,0,0
a fellow Texan here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, I've got to say, I've got a very different view than Bernie.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think actually what Bernie told you is the same thing President Obama said, it's the same thing Democrats have said, which is that you, the small business, you're apparently a bad actor, because you're not allowed to manufacture money.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"You know, let me introduce you all to two terms that have become really common, 29ers and 49ers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
29ers are the millions of people across this country that have been forced into part-time work that used to have full-time employment and are now working 29 hours a week because Obamacare kicks in at 30 hours a week.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"And a lot of them are people that are single moms, they're teenagers, they're immigrants, they're people who are struggling.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And then 49ers, there are millions of small businesses in the exact situation you're in.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, a couple of months ago, I was out in west Texas, was visiting a dairy farmer, driving around the dairy farm.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I got to say, interesting smells on the dairy farm.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Kind of reminds me of Washington.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the farmer brought up, he said, you know how many employees I have?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, no.",0,0,1,0,0,0
He said I've got 49.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"He said, do you know why I have 49?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I said, yes, I do, because Obamacare kicks in at 50.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And he said, I could hire 20 or 30 more employees right now, but Obamacare would bankrupt my business, and that's millions of small businesses.",0,0,1,1,1,1
So we're here at GW.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me speak for a minute to all the young people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you come out of college with way too many student loans, my guess is you'd like to get a job.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"And millions of small businesses being told by the Democrats, tough luck, we don't care if it drives you out of business, that's taking away opportunity and it's hurting in particular the most vulnerable.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It's one of the most damaging things about Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"LaRonda, let me ask you a question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What happens if one of your employees becomes ill?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What happens?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What happens if one of your employees, as happens in every part of the country, gets diabetes, gets cancer?",0,0,1,0,0,0
What do they do if they don't have any health insurance?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I can't really answer that question, but I can tell you that because the premiums have gone up so much this year and because I don't qualify for any kind of government subsidies, I don't have, for the first time in my life, insurance.",0,0,0,0,1,1
It's just not affordable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unfortunately, the prices of my services just don't warrant it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me just say this, two things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, as I mentioned earlier, it is absolutely true that the cost of premiums are going up.",0,0,0,1,1,1
No argument.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They went up even higher during the period of George W.  Bush.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"So it's not like, oh, gee, for the first time in American history, premiums are going up.",0,1,0,0,1,1
"Number two, Ted mentioned part-time work, the 29ers.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, there are fewer part-time employees today than there were before Obamacare, OK?",0,0,0,0,1,1
So here is the point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The bottom line is with -- the situation you've described is honestly absurd.,0,0,0,1,0,0
You should not be going around without health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Your employees should not be going around without health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We should not be spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other nation.,1,0,0,0,1,1
Please join me and fight for a Medicare for all program.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Are you looking forward -- by the way, I'm not going to ask you your age -- won't do that -- but are you looking forward maybe when you get to 65 to get Medicare?",0,0,0,0,0,1
Would that be of help to your family?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I expect that that will probably happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I certainly hope it does, and I hope Medicare is still there, despite the efforts of Senator Cruz and others, so that when you reach at least 65, you will be able to get a decent health insurance program.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, Bernie, since apparently I've now tried to kill the elderly...",0,0,0,1,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
... let me ask you a question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you heard that her premiums had skyrocketed, that she can't afford health insurance, you kind of said, well, premiums always go up.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"I mean, let me ask you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why did President Obama look in the eyes of the American people and promise LaRonda that her health insurance premiums would go down $2,500 a year?",0,0,1,0,0,1
Was he telling the truth when he said that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And were you and the other Democrats telling the truth when you echoed his promise to the American people?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Ted, first thought, as everybody knows, health care is pretty complicated.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think President Obama is an honest person, and I think, based on his assessment, that's what he believed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Was it true?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But let me -- turns out not to be true, but it turns out to be that under Bush premiums went up higher.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Not a new thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then the real question we should be talking about is why we do spend so much money on health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that means that we have to appreciate that we are spending hundreds of billions of dollars every single year not on health care, but on administration and bureaucracy.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Do you know how much money it costs to bill you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You've got people -- hundreds of people in large hospitals, they're sitting around not providing health care, they're working on paperwork, driving you crazy when you bring forth a claim.",0,0,0,1,1,1
So we have to figure out how we have a simple system that guarantees health care to all people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we do that, you and your employees will all have health insurance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, there is an area actually where we agree, which is there is way too much paperwork with health care.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There's way too much complexity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'll tell you, when you talk to doctors, when you talk to nurses, they say, I don't get to practice health care anymore.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I spend all my time filling out paperwork.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All my time -- now, where the paperwork comes from is the government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It comes from Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In fact, there's some amazing stats I'm going to go back and get, because -- because they're really quite powerful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you look at the paperwork impact, Obamacare's rules alone -- and by the way, the Obamacare rules are 20,000 pages.",0,0,0,0,1,1
They're taller than seven feet tall.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They generate $51 billion in costs and more than 172 million hours of paperwork compliance.,0,0,1,0,1,1
And let me put that in perspective.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What does that mean?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That would take 86,200 employees, working full-time, 2,000 hours a year, to complete one year of new paperwork under Obamacare.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"That's roughly the entire population of Miami Beach, Florida, doing nothing but filling out Obamacare forms.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"If you want your doctor to get back to caring for you, if you want to drive down costs, get government out of the business of dictating and controlling health care.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Ted is right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There is far too much paperwork.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Some of it is government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you know what some of it is also?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is insurance companies.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Every American who has filed a claim has the experience of fighting with the health insurance companies to make sure that they get what they are entitled to.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Doctors have to spend half of their lives arguing with the insurance companies as to whether or not they can prescribe the medicine their patients need or provide the therapy that their patients need.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Huge amount of waste.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is why we need a simple system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, as Americans, we're going to have to make a very fundamental decision.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Very simple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is health care a right of all people?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is it or not?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ted doesn't think it is; I do think it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then if we agree, and I think most Americans do, that it is a right, how do you provide health care to all people with high quality in a cost-effective way?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I happen to believe that Medicare is a popular program.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It works well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, you get it at 65.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I think every American should get Medicare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, I want to pick the discussion up right there if I may.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Cruz...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, let me make a real quick point, just because I think...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Real quick.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Real quick.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's nice having the back and forth and the...,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's lovely, absolutely.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One thing Bernie said that I think suggests maybe an area we could work together, you were talking about paperwork from insurance companies.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I agree, there's way too much paperwork for insurance companies.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I'd like insurance companies to have less power and patients to have more power.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So maybe you and I could agree on a commonsense reform of allowing LaRonda to purchase health insurance of any of the 50 states.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, she's a Texan, it's illegal for her to purchase health insurance anywhere else.",0,0,1,0,1,1
That would give her choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If she doesn't like what the Texas companies are offering, she can go to Oklahoma, she can go to Florida, she can go to any other state.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That creates a 50-state national marketplace.,0,0,0,0,1,0
It drives down cost.,0,1,0,0,1,0
It increases choices.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Why don't we stand together against the insurance companies and agree on that reform?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think standing together for a Medicare for all single-payer system is a lot better idea.",0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because -- OK, because when you have the idea that Ted was talking about, this is a race to the bottom.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what you are going to end up with, some insurance company in Mississippi or someplace, they're going to provide you insurance.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But you think your deductibles are high now?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It will be a lot higher.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, Ted, and you're right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a good discussion, all right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And here is the issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Ted, let me ask you a question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is every American entitled -- and I underline that word -- to health care as a right of being an American?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes or no?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I'm glad you asked that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, right is a word you use a lot.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's talk about what rights are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Rights mean you have a right for government not to mess with you, for government not to do things with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you look at the Bill of Rights, the Bill of Rights, free speech means the government can't silence you when you're speaking.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Religious liberty means the government can't control who you worship, what your faith is.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The Second Amendment means the government can't take away your guns.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Those are rights.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, what the Declaration of Independence said, we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So what is a right is access to health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What is a right is choosing your own doctor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you believe health care is a right, why on Earth did you help write Obamacare that caused six million people to have their health insurance canceled, that had them lose their doctors, and have people like LaRonda, who can't get health insurance, can't afford premiums...",1,0,1,1,1,1
For a start...,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're denying her what you say is her right.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, two things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You didn't answer the question, although I interpret your question to be that LaRonda does not have a right.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"No, that's not what I said.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Woah, woah, woah, I heard the Bill of Rights.",0,0,1,0,0,0
What I said is access to health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Access to health care is a right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She has access.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But she doesn't have enough money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And choosing your doctor is a right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, LaRonda, you have access right now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Go out and get a really great health insurance program.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, you can't do it?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Because you can't afford it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what he's saying.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Access to what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You want to buy one of Donald Trump's mansions?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have access to do that, as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, you can't afford $5 million for a house?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Sorry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Access doesn't mean a damn thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What it means is whether people can afford it, can get the health care that they need.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they can't under Obamacare.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Second of all, let's -- some people have problems, no question about it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm not arguing with you on that, Ted.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But don't argue with me when I tell you that 20 million more people did get health insurance, all right?",0,0,0,0,1,1
We used to have 48 million people in this country who had zero insurance before Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Now that number, much too high, is 28 million.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Last point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Ted talked to the young people, and he said, I want you to go out with enthusiasm, go out and go to -- get a job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But under Ted's ideas, if Obamacare is repealed, right now, if you're under 26, you can stay in your parents' insurance program.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That's one of the things we did in Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Good idea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ted would repeal that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So as you go out into the real world, be very careful about not having an accident.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senators...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because you don't have any health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I want to tell our audience, we're going to take a quick break.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a lot more to discuss.,0,0,0,0,0,0
More of CNN's debate night and the future of ae Obamacare right after this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(COMMERCIAL BREAK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Welcome back to the CNN health care debate with Senators Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senators, thanks so much for participating here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to ask you, since Obamacare was enacted, governors of 31 states, plus the District of Columbia, have opted to expand Medicaid through federal funding, providing insurance to 11 million low income people.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"One of the Americans who benefitted from the Obamacare Medicaid expansion is Carol Hardaway of Salisbury, Maryland.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Carol?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have multiple sclerosis, but could not afford insurance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Without the treatment or medications I need, I had problems with walking, with my speech, and my vision.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When the Affordable Care Act was passed, I moved from our home state of Texas -- because they refused to expand Medicaid -- to Maryland, and within two weeks, I started receiving treatments through Medicaid and am now well enough to work as a substitute teach.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Senator Cruz, can you promise me that you and the Republican leaders in Congress will have -- actually have a replacement plan in place for people like me who depend on their Medicaid?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In other words, I like my coverage.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Can I keep it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Carol, thank you for sharing your story.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And congratulations on dealing with MS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a terrible disease.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And congratulations on your struggles dealing with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, if you look at Medicaid, more than half of the people who have been covered under Obamacare have been under Medicaid.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And the problem is:  Medicaid is a profoundly troubled program.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And so it may be working well with you, but I'll tell you nationally, the health outcomes under Medicaid are really poor.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Nationally, 54 percent of doctors won't take new Medicaid patients.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Nationally, dental care appointments for moms are denied at a 63 percent rate on Medicaid.",0,0,1,0,1,1
The denial rate for private insurance is 4 percent.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And Medicaid patients are almost twice as likely to die from medical treatment as those with private health insurance.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"The solution for people who are hurting, I believe, we should have a system that allows as many people as possible to be on the private health insurance of your choice rather than Medicaid, because the Medicaid outcomes are not working and people are suffering.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And what's happened also -- it's really quite striking -- because Obamacare dramatically expanded Medicaid, many of the people who had been on Medicaid, many of the people who are really suffering and needy, have found their wait times increasing.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"In fact in Illinois, on Medicaid, over 700 people have died on the waiting list for care for Medicaid.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"So, I'm glad that you're receiving healthcare.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I can tell you a great many of the people on Medicaid aren't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'd much rather see a system where we can have millions of those on Medicaid getting health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The only way we can is if we have competition so that rates are lower so you can afford to have health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Senator Sanders?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We heard from a woman who runs a hair salon in Ft. Worth who can't afford to provide health insurance for her workers and herself.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We hear a story now about a woman who has to leave her own state and go to another state because that state is providing Medicaid.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"My friends, you are living -- I know you don't know this -- by these stories.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're living in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, where the rich are becoming phenomenally richer while we have 43 million people living in poverty and the middle class is in decline.",0,0,0,0,1,1
These stories are obscene.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They should not be taking place in the United States.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Now, are there problems with Medicaid?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course, there are.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you something, to those Republicans governors around the country who told poor people that they would not be able to, for the first time in their lives in many instances, get access to healthcare, to be able to go to a doctor when the federal government paid for the first three years at 100 percent.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"I hope that those governors sleep well at night, because I don't know how many people lost their lives as a result of their decision.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"So, once again, what we are looking at is a dysfunctional system.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We spend more, we get less.",0,0,0,0,0,0
People who work hard have no health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,1
People have to move from one state or the other.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"This country finally is going to have to do, in my view, what every other major country does.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And yes, I believe, Ted, healthcare is a human right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I believe that this country has got to join every other major country and say, you can stay home and get quality care because you're an American.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You can run your small business well and get care because you are an American.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is where we have got to go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you know, when Bernie says, well, Medicaid has problems.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You want to talk about people who lost their rights, 742 people in Illinois were put on a waiting list for Medicaid after Illinois expanded its Medicaid, Barack Obama's home state, and they died awaiting care under Medicaid.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because Medicaid is rationed care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Those wait lists -- you know, Bernie likes to talk about medical care for all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me be clear what his program is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's Medicaid for all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is rationed care nationally.,0,1,0,0,0,1
You want to know what that looks like.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He keeps pointing to other countries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's look at, for example, the United Kingdom.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The United Kingdom, a 2001 report noted that 39 percent over 80 in the United Kingdom received surgery for breast cancer, compared to 90 percent of the women under 50.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And that women under -- men and women under the age of 55 were 2 1/2 times more likely than those over 75 to receive cancer treatments.,0,0,1,0,1,1
More than 80 percent of older patients in the United Kingdom believe they're discriminated against by their government-run healthcare.,0,0,0,0,1,1
You want to know what rationing looks like.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It looks like Medicaid.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It looks like the people who are suffering.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you look at this country, across this country, we have 291 million people roughly that are covered by insurance.",0,0,1,0,1,1
I don't think we should be screwing up the insurance of millions of Americans and putting them under rationing.,0,0,0,1,0,0
That's what Obamacare has moved us down the road to doing and it's not working,0,0,0,0,1,0
"OK, Ted correctly indicates Medicaid has problems and Vermont has problems.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"All over the country, it has problems.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what Ted's solution is?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Massive cuts in federal funding for Medicaid.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"So, you've got a problem and what Ted wants to do is make it worse.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You mentioned dental care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Maybe you want to go on my bill, which will provide dental care to tens of millions of American who can't afford it right now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What we need to do, by the way, is to tell dentists out there that they may have to do more than just make you have a nice smile.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they may have to provide real dental care to children and others who absolutely need it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Furthermore, what we have to do is we need tens of thousands more doctors in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We have a major crisis in primary care.,0,0,0,0,1,0
There are areas in urban America and in rural America where people literally can't find a doctor to serve their needs.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And one of the reasons, a number of reasons for that, one of them is you go to medical school, you can come out hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And then you're going to become a plastic surgeon not doing primary care in an urban area or rural America, which tells me we've got to expand the program called the National Health Service Corps so that our young people can get their debts repaid if they commit to serving in under-served areas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Let's get doctors out into the areas where we need them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just jump in if I can.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Carol, you just shake your head.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Did Senator Cruz, your former senator, did he answer your question?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, he did not.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"The question was, Senator Cruz, can you promise me that you and the Republican leaders in Congress will actually have a replacement plan in place for people like me who depend on their Medicaid?",0,0,0,0,0,0
She got Medicaid through the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We've all heard you criticize Medicaid.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What happens to Carol?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, what I said, Jake, is that Medicaid isn't working for millions of people and Obamacare made Medicaid worse by expanding the wait lists by jamming more people on it.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"You want to talk about replacement, there's widespread agreement on replacement plans.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Number one, allowing people to purchase across state lines, giving you more choice.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, Bernie said he opposes that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He doesn't want to let you buy insurance in other states.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Number two, expanding health savings accounts so you can save in a tax advantaged way to meet your own healthcare needs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number three, making health insurance portable so that it goes with you from job to job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I imagine, ma'am, at some point, you had insurance with a job?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If insurance was portable right now, federal tax law incentivizes -- most of us get our insurance from the government and if you lose your -- or not from the government, from our employer rather.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And if you lose your job, you lose that insurance.",0,1,0,0,0,0
One of the best solutions to the problem of preexisting conditions is making health insurance portable that goes with you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, when you lose your job, you don't lose your car insurance, your life insurance, your house insurance.",0,0,1,0,0,1
There's no reason to lose your health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if your insurance is portable, it goes with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's affordable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have choices.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, notice Bernie's solution, we want more doctors.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We all agree on more doctors.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He says, well, the government needs to hire more.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, I can point to something that works on that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In Texas, we passed tort reform.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We fundamentally limited lawsuits and lawsuit abuse.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And you know what we've seen -- we've seen the number of doctors increasing dramatically.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We've seen medical malpractice premiums dropping.,0,0,1,1,1,0
Those are the kind of solutions supported at the state level that will result in more doctors.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But Obamacare is discouraging people from going to medical school and training to be doctors.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Well, Ted, I didn't want to raise it, but you brought it forth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what state in the country -- and I don't blame you for this -- but what state in the country has the highest rate of uninsured in America by far?,0,0,0,0,1,1
It is the state of Texas.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, by the way, may I say proudly that Vermont is number two in terms of the percentage of people who are insured.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We have relatively few uninsured.,0,1,0,0,1,1
"And, by the way, amazingly enough, you know what state in the country has the highest rate of people insured?",0,0,0,0,1,1
"It is Massachusetts with RomneyCare, which was the prototype for the Affordable Care Act.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, you know, the nice thing, Bernie, again, people vote with their feet.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And for north of a decade now, roughly a thousand people a day have been moving to Texas because we have an environment that allows people to get jobs.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And so, people vote with their feet.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you're right, there are states, Vermont is a lovely state.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It doesn't have a ton of diversity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It doesn't have nearly the populations Texas has that are populations that are just starting -- when my dad went to Texas in 1957 when he was 18, he couldn't speak English.",0,0,0,0,1,1
He was from Cuba.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He had $100 in his underwear.,0,0,1,0,1,0
He watched dishes making 50 cents an hour.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
He didn't have healthcare.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But he came to go to the University of Texas, he came to get",0,0,0,0,0,0
opportunity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That job enabled him to get another job where he could get healthcare.,0,1,0,0,0,0
That's a much better solution.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Create an environment where you don't tax the living daylights out of people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's why people choose --,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senators --,0,0,0,0,0,0
-- to be where they get --,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senators --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Aren't we all happy that under Obama, we created 15 million new jobs in the private sector?",0,1,1,0,1,1
"Senators, I want to get to more audience questions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This one is about the fact that the Affordable Care Act requires that all insurance plans cover what the law calls essential health benefits.,0,0,0,0,1,1
This includes maternity and delivery costs.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We have a question on what will happen to that coverage for Maria Shahid Rowe, who is pregnant with her second child.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Maria?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm a nursing student at the Medical University of South Carolina.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm concerned about the implications that repealing the Affordable Care Act will have on women's health and specifically for pregnant women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I'm five months pregnant and I'm actually qualified for Medicaid due to being a full-time student.",0,0,0,0,0,1
My husband works for a church.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We live in a very modest income at the moment.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Senator Cruz, what policies do you have in place to protect pregnant women from losing their health coverage either due to being considered having a preexisting condition or from being charged higher insurance premiums than men?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, congratulations on your new baby.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Is it a boy or girl?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a surprise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, wonderful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
And you said you have an older child?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What's your older child?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a 2-year-old son.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What's his name?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Samson.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, maybe you have Delilah and that would be --",0,0,0,0,0,0
(LAUGHTER),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, how wonderful and congratulations.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Heidi and I have two little girls at home and it is a wonderful, wonderful thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Listen, cover -- maternity coverage is incredibly important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But here's how Obamacare worked -- you had a lot of politicians in Washington who said we're going to mandate every coverage on Earth.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And it sounds really good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I had a conversation a couple of years ago with a gentleman in Amarillo, Texas, who told me the story about his 101-year-old aunt who had just had her insurance cancelled.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And she said the reason it was cancelled was that it didn't cover maternity care.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, this fellow laughed and said, my aunt is 101 years old.",0,0,0,0,0,1
She doesn't really need maternity coverage right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We should have a system, I believe, where you can choose to get the policies that meet your needs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the impact, especially for young people, of all the mandated coverage -- you know, it's interesting the Democrats view -- they're big on talking about insurance coverage.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But it's a little bit like giving everyone a bus ticket when there are no buses.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"What we should care about is access to healthcare, not just insurance per se.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And what's happened under Obamacare is that millions of people can't afford it.,0,0,0,1,1,1
We should be concerned about people being able to afford health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that means giving them the choice in 50 states to choose a policy.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"In your instance, you would choose a politician that had maternity coverage.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But someone else who right now kind of can't afford might choose a different policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when government mandates it, those choices go away.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, your response?",0,0,0,0,0,0
What Ted is really telling you is that they will not guarantee coverage for you.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And not every pregnancy is planned and if a woman under -- a pregnant woman before Obamacare, you know what you were considered to be?",0,0,0,0,0,0
A preexisting condition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And why would an insurance company want to provide care to you when having a baby is a fairly expensive proposition?,0,0,0,0,0,1
You don't make money doing that.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And Ted keeps talking about these mandates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, let's be clear again what Senator Cruz and his Republican friends want to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Senator Sanders, let me follow up on that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to respond to that briefly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Please?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, it's interesting sometimes the rhetoric that our friends on the left like to say that anyone who doesn't support government control of our healthcare somehow doesn't like and fit in whatever population you're talking about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's again go back to facts and let's talk about young people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, there's no group in America that's been hurt more by Obamacare than young people.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Young people were left on the chopping block.,0,0,1,0,1,0
Let's talk about some basic stats.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A recent study found that the Obamacare mandates, what Bernie just sang an ode to, have increased -- the three costliest mandates have increased premiums for younger people by 44 percent.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"Without those mandates, the typical 21-year-old would pay $1,100 a year less.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"If you're 21, think about whether it would be easier to afford healthcare if it cost $1,100 a year less.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And let's talk about some specifics.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Before Obamacare, the most affordable plan that was available for a 30-year-old Texan, for a 30- year-old Texan woman was $470 a year.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Today, under Obamacare, the cheapest plan that's available for a healthy 30-year-old woman in Ft. Worth is $3,236.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"It's gone from $470 to $3,000, over $3,200.",0,0,1,0,1,1
That's why young people are hurting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what Obamacare did is it jacked up the rates on all the young people.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Why do you think there's an individual mandate?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's to force young people to pay really high rates to subsidize the rest of the system.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And if you don't pay it, the IRS fines you.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"And, you know, over 6 million people are fined each year by the IRS under Obamacare.",0,0,1,0,1,1
That's who -- (CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, we're going to get to the question of fines and so forth in a minute.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to circle back to women's health and ask you, Senator Sanders, why should a 60-year-old male or women beyond childbearing years be required to have health insurance plans that have maternity care?",0,0,0,0,0,1
I don't think they should.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what Obama --,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's one of the things we might want to look at.,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I do believe that in the United States of America, where we talk a lot about our love for children, that pregnancy is not and should not be considered a preexisting condition.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That every woman in this country who gets pregnant should be 100 percent assured that she is going to get the highest quality care she needs to deliver a healthy baby.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Cruz, I want to stay on the issue of women's health.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under Obamacare, women pay nothing out-of-pocket for birth control.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"So, will that continue under any Republican replacement?",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to be a choice for each patient to make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Listen, Obamacare is all about these mandates.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you know, Margaret Thatcher famously said, the problem with socialism, eventually you run out of other people's money.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The same is true with the mandates.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've never driven a Lamborghini.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"I mean, they look kind of fun.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm willing to bet most of us, if that was the mandate -- and it would be cool, you sit in a leather seat, you could go 200 miles an hour, what it would mean for most people is you couldn't afford a car?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If they said, but, you know, gosh, the VW Bug is not fancy enough.",0,0,0,1,0,0
You need everything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For most people who can't afford it, it doesn't work.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's what Obamacare is doing.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I would love for everyone to have maximum coverage on everything, but there's no magic fairy with pixie dust that gives it away for free.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These mandates are hurting people because it's putting people in a situation like Rolanda (ph) where they get nothing, they don't get healthcare of any kind.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Her employees don't get healthcare because Obamacare has driven the cost up.,0,0,1,1,1,1
That's why people are hurting so much under it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Two points.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our employees are not getting healthcare because in Texas, you did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.",0,0,1,0,1,1
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She has 49 employees.,0,0,0,0,1,1
She is not covered under it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
She's,0,0,0,0,0,0
not hiring more because --,0,0,0,0,0,0
Lower income people would be eligible for Medicaid.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Second of all, I think that it is very clear that the discussion that we're having when Ted talks about mandates, I look at it differently.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And also, what we should be clear about is Ted says, well, just not enough money, we can't all drive fancy cars.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I think it's a bit disingenuous to talk about driving a fancy car with getting access to healthcare when you're sick.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Last point on this issues, if we repeal the Affordable Care Act, we are going to provide $346 billion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent.",1,0,0,0,1,1
Ted in other ways goes even further.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He wants to repeal the estate tax which applies to the top 2/10 of 1 percent, the very wealthiest people in this country, and give them collectively hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Ted, we are the wealthiest country in the world.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And it's not a question of everybody driving a fancy car, but it is a question to making sure that every man, woman and child in this country has healthcare as a right.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I want to bring back to a subject --,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I said, listen, Bernie talks about how Washington is corrupt, how both parties, how both parties are in bed with big business and big money and it is a corrupt system benefitting special interests.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I agree absolutely and entirely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what I tell folks is where I disagree is in his solution.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"If the problem is government is corrupt, why on earth would you want more power in Washington?",0,0,0,1,0,0
I want to take power out of Washington and empower the people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When it comes to taxes, what I want a simple flat tax of 10 percent for everyone and abolish the IRS.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That ends the power of lobbyists.,0,0,0,1,0,0

Good.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We're going to take a very quick break.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Welcome back to the CNN debate on the future of Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's turn now to the rise in prescription drug costs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For that, I want to bring in Cole Gelrod.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He comes from Denver, Colorado.",0,0,0,0,0,1
He's a father of two whose daughter Juniper requires medication that would cost $900 a month without Medicaid.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Cole?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My 3-year-old daughter born with undiagnosed severe heart defect and required a heart transplant when she was only at 7 months old.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Unfortunately for us and families like ours, our employer-provided insurance does not cover the most vital of my daughter's life-saving prescriptions.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"This luckily hasn't been unbearable financial burden for my family because of Obamacare, and particularly the Medicaid expansion.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Senator Cruz, regardless of what happens with health care reform, how do you plan to address the rising cost of prescription drugs?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Additionally, how would you like to address a healthcare insurance where companies can choose to not cover drugs that people like my daughter need to live?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, thank you for the question and thank you for the care you give to your 3-year-old daughter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know that is not easy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the question you ask is one of the great challenges facing this,0,0,0,0,0,0
country as we've seen the cost of drugs increasing dramatically.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"One area Bernie and I talked about, we agree on, is allowing importation of drugs into this country from other countries where they are cheaper.",0,0,0,0,1,1
There's no reason why we should be subsidizing other countries across the globe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But another fundamental area is FDA reform, where the costs of getting a new drug approved are prohibitively expensive.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I don't know if you've ever seen, or folks have ever seen the movie ""Dallas Buyers' Club"".",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It's a wonderful movie with Matthew McConaughey about a gentleman in Texas who had AIDS, and wanted to get drugs to care for and the FDA wouldn't allow it here and he would travel to Mexico, he traveled to Japan, he traveled all over the world trying to get life- saving drugs.",0,0,1,0,0,1
There are story after story after story of exactly that happening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Life-saving drugs that are available, that are approved.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They're used in Europe.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They're used in Canada, and the FDA won't allow it.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"That's why I think FDA reform is so valuable that if we lift the barriers, to let people try, give you a right to try.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If it's your life, you have a right to choose.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have a right to try.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The key to it is competition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Listen, the big boys, the big players like government regulation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Dodd-Frank benefitted the big banks.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Tough FDA barriers to entry benefit the big pharmaceutical companies.,0,1,0,1,1,0
Massive complexity in tax laws benefits big corporations.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"By reducing those barriers, we have competition and there's opportunity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe we can have innovative cures.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To give you a sense, the four most devastating diseases in terms of human life and dollars, heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes and cancer.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We ought to be investing everything we can to cure those diseases.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just curing cancer, an incredible achievement, would save $50 trillion and countless lives across the globe.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Thank you, Senator --",0,0,0,0,0,0
And the FDA is a barrier to doing that.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We need to change them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here is the simple issue:  we pay -- just as the case with health care -- we pay by far once again the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Fifteen years ago, you know what I need?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I took a bus load of women, working-class women from Vermont dealing with breast cancer across the Canadian border and they were able to purchase Tamoxifen, it's a widely used breast cancer drug, at that point.",0,0,1,0,1,1
It's changed -- for 1/10th the price they're paying in the United States of America.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Tears were coming of these working class women's eyes fighting for their lives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What's going on?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What's going on is the pharmaceutical industry owns,0,0,0,1,0,1
the United States Congress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in all fairness, I will admit, it's not just Republicans.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They have a huge influence over the Democratic Party as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, right now, the reality is uniquely in the whole world, you can walk in tomorrow to the -- your pharmacy, the cost that you pay for medicine could be double or triple, and there's nothing anybody can do about it.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"So, what do we have to do?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to tell the pharmaceutical industry which in 2015 made $50 billion in profit for the five major companies where the top ten executives made over $300 million in compensation, we're going to have to be very loud and clear, and say, stop ripping off the American people.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Two things that we can do immediately -- Ted is right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I introduced and will introduce and look forward to your co-sponsorship of legislation to say that pharmacists and distributors and the American people should be able to buy FDA-approved medicine anyplace in the world.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"That will drive down prices in this country, because then you'll have international competition.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Second thing we need to do, and I believe, believe it or not, I think even Donald Trump may be on board this, hard to believe, but we should be negotiating drug prices through Medicare.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Medicare spends zillions of dollars for medicines.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Right now Republicans put language in some years ago which prevents them from negotiating prices.,0,0,1,1,1,1
I would hope Ted will join me in saying that Medicare should be able to do what the V.A.,0,0,0,0,0,0
does.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can lower prices as well.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But the bottom line here is, you've got 1,400 well-paid lobbyists right now and they are working, if I may say this, they're working against you.",0,0,0,1,1,1
They're working against your daughter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The only thing they want is more and more profit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they could care less about the needs of the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, but, Bernie, the barriers are also coming from government.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And I will give an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A Texas constituent Kaci Lay (ph) has a 7-year-old daughter who was put on a feeding tube when she was 7 months old.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And there's a drug called Domperidone that is used all across the world to treat the condition she has called gastroparesis.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"She was put on Domperidone, this 7-month-old girl.",0,0,1,0,0,0
She was off the feeding tube.,0,0,1,0,0,0
She was living well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Domperidone is available in more than 100 countries, including Canada and throughout the European Union.",0,0,0,0,1,1
But the FDA has been aggressively enforcing an import ban here.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"And I'll tell you what Kaci's mother said, ""I fear she will need to get a feeding tube again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How do I tell her that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She's a little girl who has worked extremely hard to overcome her fears of eating and now her joy of just being a normal little girl will be taken away.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
We shouldn't have the government putting barriers to people getting the drugs they need.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that's a fair point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think if you have a product that has been deemed safe by countries that have high standards in this area, I think you make a good point.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But I think the more important point is that the government of the United States representing the American people has got to control the incredible greed of the pharmaceutical industry.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Will you join me?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do appreciate you coming on board the re-importation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I really do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we can win it if we got Republican support.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Will you stand with me in saying that Medicare which spends a huge amount of money for prescription drugs should be able to negotiate prices?,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Oh, listen, of course, Medicare should negotiate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you and I have a different view on how you control greed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Will you be on board that legislation?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hold on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me finish what I'm saying.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your view -- you said before that, gosh, these executives make too much money.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I don't think the government should be in the business of deciding what you get paid and you get paid and you get paid.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there are socialist countries on earth.,0,0,0,0,0,1
There are socialist countries that you encourage us to be like.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But those countries are not doing nearly as well as America.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, the per capita income in America is over five times the average per capita income in this world.",0,0,0,0,1,1
It's 50 percent more than the per capita income in Europe.,0,0,1,0,1,1
This is a land of opportunity because there is social mobility.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In socialist countries, if you are born poor, you usually stay poor.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"The advantage of this country, someone can start out a dishwasher like my dad did and the free enterprise system in this country lets people rise.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So, I don't think the answer is government putting wage and price controls in and deciding --",0,0,0,1,0,1
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders --,0,0,0,0,0,0
The point was that millions of Americans can't afford the medicine while the drug companies are making incredible profits and paying their CEOs obscene compensation packages.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Yes, that does concern me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In terms of socialist countries, you think Denmark and Sweden and Finland are terrible places to live.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I think they do pretty well --,0,0,0,0,0,0
I choose to live in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, let's get back to America and to the Affordable Care Act.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Throughout your campaign, you said that taxes should go up on the",0,1,0,0,1,1
"rich, not the middle class.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And yet, millions of Americans who chose not to get health care are forced to pay a tax penalty.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"So, families of four are paying up to $2,000 per year for failing to purchase coverage.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"Many say that they can't afford the premiums, so it's just cheaper for them to pay the penalty than get health care.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So, is it fair to put this tax burden on families?",0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But on the other hand, is it fair to not raise the revenue that we need to provide the kinds of benefits that we are providing?",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is a way to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think it's a particularly good way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I disagree with Ted, who wants to give, according to the ""Wall Street Journal"" and many other publications, incredible tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"I think in the wealthiest country in the world, we should raise funds in a progressive way, where the very rich are now doing phenomenally well -- yes, I do believe they should be asked to pay more in taxes and I think we should use that money and other mechanisms to provide health care to all people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Senator, on that very topic, the top 1 percent are paying a lot more in taxes under Obamacare.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"But if you repeal it, will the top 1 percent, the wealthiest Americans effectively get a tax cut?",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Well, Dana, let me point out that Bernie acknowledged that 6.5 million Americans are paying Obamacare tax fines because they can't afford insurance.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"So, they can't afford health insurance and then the IRS comes in and fines them.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"He says, gosh, I don't agree with that.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And yet, throughout the Democratic debate, Bernie says he helped write Obamacare that imposes these fines on people.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I think it's wrong to be fining people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me make a broader point on taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Many times in this debate, Bernie has talked about providing health care for free from the government.",0,0,0,0,1,1
You know what?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The simplest principle in economics is TANSTAAFL, there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The liberal-leaning Urban Institute scored Bernie's health plan, concluded it would cost $2.5 trillion in the first year and $32 trillion over ten years.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, how much that is?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Trillions, it's a big number.",0,0,1,0,1,1
It's not clear what that is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me put it in perspective.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All of the federal income taxes we pay today are about $1.5 trillion a year.,0,0,0,0,1,1
$2.5 trillion means every one of us paying income taxes would have to about triple what you pay in income taxes to get an additional $2.5 trillion.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"Now, Bernie no doubt is going to come back and say, no, no, no, none of you are going to pay.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Just the rich.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, how about if we took every person that makes over $1 million a",0,0,0,0,0,0
"year and confiscated 100 percent of their income, took every penny that they make.",0,0,1,1,1,1
That would raise only enough money to fund Bernie's plan for five months.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Here's another idea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"How about if the government confiscated the assets of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and ExxonMobil, if it came in, illegally seized those companies and sold them, that would pay for one year of Bernie's plan.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"If you don't want to see your taxes triple in addition to the wait lists, in addition to the rationing, in addition to fewer MRIs and mammograms to worse care, then you don't want to see Bernie's Medicaid for all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You want to see cheap, affordable health care that you can choose that puts you in control.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Quote, ""Wall Street Journal"", October 29th, 2015.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Ted Cruz's -- Wall Street Journal,"" not my paper, your paper, maybe.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Oh, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Ted Cruz's new tax plan delivers its biggest benefits to the top 1 percent of U.S. households, adding about one-third to their after-tax income.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Here is the economic reality facing America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the last 35 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class and the working class to the top one-tenth of 1 percent.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We are talking about trillions of dollars.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Ted's response to that is he's going to support the repeal of the estate tax, correct?",0,0,0,0,0,0
You're on record in doing that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Among many things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
Among many other breaks to billionaires.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to bankrupt small business owners.,0,0,0,1,0,0
(CROSSTALK),0,0,0,0,0,0
The only people who pay the estate tax are the top two- tenths of 1 percent.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It would cost us over $200 billion.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"And as Ted said, it goes on and on and on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, this right wing hyperbole of we can confiscate everybody -- it's not going to do anything.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Here's the basic point: if we pass the Sanders plan, 95 percent of people in this country would have more after-tax income than they have right now.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Senators, I'm sorry.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's clear we have a lot more to debate and we can do that at a later time but we have to take a break.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now it's time for closing statements.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Each senator will get two minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to begin with Senator Bernie Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me thank Ted for being here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me thank CNN for sponsoring this debate which I thought has been a very interesting discussion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As I see it, the great political problem that we face right now is that we have a Congress that is more interested in representing their campaign contributors and the very wealthy than the needs of ordinary Americans.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Ted ran a very vigorous campaign for president.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I congratulate him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Ted also received $36 million in their campaign from three billionaires, three billionaires.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"And as a result of Citizens United, we are now looking at the Koch brothers, the second wealthiest family in America, and other billionaires literally buying elections.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And that translates into health care policy because the end result is that Congress worries more about the insurance industry and the pharmaceutical industry and the medical equipment suppliers than they do about the needs of the American people.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"If you listen closely to the very fine questions that people here asked tonight, and you take a step backward, you say whoa, what kind of craziness is this?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world and yet we have tens and tens and tens of millions of people struggling with prescription drugs, struggling with basic health care.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Yes, we can do better than that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then on top of all of that, we end up spending almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, what Ted is proposing is to make a difficult situation even worse.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"To my mind, Obamacare is a step forward.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have got to go further.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what Ted wants to do is do away with many of the patient protection bills, provisions, that were passed, pre-existing conditions, a cap on what you have to pay, making sure that women are not discriminated against, making sure that young people can stay on their parents' insurance programs.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Under Ted's idea, all of that is gone.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You are on your own.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that is a very bad idea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Senator.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Cruz?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to thank Bernie for being here and for being a vigorous and honest debater.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He believes what he believes and he represents it well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I want to thank each much you for spending so much time addressing this critically important issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I'd like to take a minute and ask the people if the cameras could turn for a moment to the folks in the audience, I want to ask you how many of you here in the last six years have seen your health insurance premiums or your deductibles go up?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me ask another question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How many of you here know somebody including yourself who has had your insurance policy canceled in the last six years?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you look at these hands across the room, this is why people are so unhappy with Obamacare, because it isn't working, because it was built on an edifice of lies.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"When politicians promise the American people, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, and 6 million people get their plans canceled against their wishes, those are broken promises.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"When the president of the United States promises your premiums will drop $2,500 and instead, the average premium rises $5,000 and deductibles go up $5,000, people are hurting because of Obamacare.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"And Bernie's solution -- you know, I'm reminded of an old ""Saturday Night Live"" skit with Christopher Walken where they are playing in a band and he keeps ringing the cow bell.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And every team they recorded his solution is more cow bell, more cow bell.",0,0,1,0,1,0
It was government control that messed this all up.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"And Bernie and the Democrats' solution is more cow bell, more cow bell.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, it didn't work when we said you wouldn't get your plan canceled.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Yes, it didn't work when we said your premiums would be cut.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But give government even more power.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can do better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe we are going to honor the promises we made to the American people and we are going to repeal what Bill Clinton called Obamacare the craziest law in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Instead, we're going to give you choice, let you buy insurance across state lines, expand health savings accounts, make insurance portable, block grant Medicaid to the states so you can have experimentation, health savings accounts so we can meet your need, put you in charge of your health care with your doctor, not government.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"That's what this election was about, and now, it is incumbent on all of us, Republicans and Democrats, to deliver on the promises made to the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our thanks to Senator Cruz and Senator Sanders for joining us here tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we also want to thank our audience here, our hosts at my alma mater, the George Washington University.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Good evening and welcome to the NBC News Youtube Democratic candidate's debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0

And New Hampshire not far behind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Tonight will be the final opportunity to see these candidates face to face before the voting begins.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our purpose here tonight is to highlight and examine the differences among the three Democratic candidates.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I know you'll all keep exactly to time, so our job should be pretty easy here tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll have questions from the Youtube community throughout the debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a critical point in the race.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've been defining your differences with each other especially vigorously in the last week on the campaign trail.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're here to facilitate this conversation on behalf of the voters so that they know exactly where you stand as you face off tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's have a great debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We'll begin with 45 second opening statements from each candidate, starting with Secretary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, good evening.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"You know, I remember well when my youth minister took me to hear Dr. King.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was a teenager.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And his moral clarity, the message that he conveyed that evening really stayed with me and helped to set me on a path to service.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I also remember that he spent the last day of his life in Memphis, fighting for dignity and higher pay for working people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And that is our fight still.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to get the economy working and incomes rising for everyone, including those who have been left out and left behind.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to keep our communities and our country safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need a president who can do all aspects of the job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I understand that this is the hardest job in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm prepared and ready to take it on and I hope to earn your support to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and the next president of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, your opening statement, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As we honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., it's important not only that we remember what he stood for, but that we pledge to continue his vision to transform our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As we look out at our country today, what the American people understand is we have an economy that's rigged, that ordinary Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, 47 million people living in poverty, and almost all of the new income and wealth going to the top one percent.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And then, to make a bad situation worse, we have a corrupt campaign finance system where millionaires and billionaires are spending extraordinary amounts of money to buy elections.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"This campaign is about a political revolution to not only elect the president, but to transform this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Governor O'Malley, your opening statement, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My name is Martin O'Malley, I was born the year Dr. King delivered his ""I Have A Dream"" speech.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I want to thank the people of South Carolina, not only for hosting our debate here tonight, but also for what you taught all of us in the aftermath of the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel Church.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You taught us, in fact, in keeping with Dr. King's teaching, that love would have the final word when you took down the Confederate flag from your state house; let go of the past and move forward.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Eight years ago, you brought forward a new leader in Barack Obama to save our country from the second Great Depression.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And that's what he's done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our country's doing better, we're creating jobs again.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"But in order to make good on the promise of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law, and we have urgent work to do, and the voices of anger and fear and division that we've heard coming off of the Republican presidential podiums are pretty loud.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need new leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why I'm running for president.,0,0,0,0,0,0

All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Governor, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"All right, to our first question, now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The first question, I'll be addressing to all of the candidates.",0,0,0,0,0,0
President Obama came to office determined to swing for the fences on health care reform.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Voters want to know how you would define your presidency?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How would you think big?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So complete this sentence: in my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be — fill in the blank.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that's what our campaign is about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is thinking big.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is understanding that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we should have health care for every man, woman, and child as a right that we should raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour; that we have got to create millions of decent- paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So, what my first days are about is bringing America together, to end the decline of the middle class, to tell the wealthiest people in this country that yes, they are going to start paying their fair share of taxes, and that we are going to have a government that works for all of us, and not just big campaign contributors.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, same question, my first 100 days in office, my top three priorities will be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would work quickly to present to the Congress my plans for creating more good jobs in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean and renewable energy, raising the minimum wage, and guaranteeing, finally, equal pay for women's work.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I would also...,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
...I would also be presenting my plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and to improve it by decreasing the out-of-pocket costs by putting a cap on prescription drug costs; by looking for ways that we can put the prescription drug business and the health insurance company business on a more stable platform that doesn't take too much money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And third, I would be working, in every way that I knew, to bring our country together.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We do have too much division, too much mean- spiritedness.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There's a lot we have to do on immigration reform, on voting rights, on campaign finance reform, but we need to do it together.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's how we'll have the kind of country for the 21st century that we know will guarantee our children and grandchildren the kind of future they deserve.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor O'Malley, same question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I would lay out an agenda to make wages go up again for all Americans, rather than down.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Equal pay for equal work, making it easier rather than harder for people to join labor unions and bargain collectively for better wages; getting 11 million of our neighbors out of the underground shadow economy by passing comprehensive immigration reform, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, however we can, wherever we can.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Secondly, I believe the greatest business opportunity to come to the United States of America in 100 years is climate change.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I put forward a plan to move us to a 100 percent clean electric energy grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way.,0,1,0,0,1,1
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've all...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Finally — I'm sorry, that was second, Lester.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And third and finally, we need a new agenda for America's cities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have not had a new agenda for America's cities since Jimmy Carter.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"We need a new agenda for America cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people, that will invest in CBVG transportation, infrastructure and transit options, and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
All right governor thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've all laid out large visions and we're going to cover a lot of the ground you talked about as we continue in the evening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The last couple of weeks of this campaign have featured some of the sharpest exchanges in the race.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's start with one of them, the issue of guns.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, last week Secretary Clinton called you quote, ""a pretty reliable vote for the gun lobby.""",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Right before the debate you changed your position on immunity from lawsuits for gun manufacturers, can you tell us why?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, I think Secretary Clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I was in 1988, there were three candidates running for congress in the state of Vermont, I stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And that includes people of criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I support what President Obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and I think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people.,0,0,1,1,0,1
This should not be a political issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What we should be doing is working together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control, I believe that I am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator, but you didn't answer the question that you did change your position on immunity from gun manufacturers.",0,0,0,1,1,1
So can you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I have said, is that gun manufacturer's liability bill has some good provisions among other things, we've prohibited ammunition that would've killed cops who had protection on.",0,0,1,1,1,1
We have child safety protection work on guns in that legislation.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And what we also said, ""is a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun.""",0,0,0,1,1,1
"So what I said is, "" I would re-look at it.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to re- look at it and I will support stronger provisions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond to Senator Sanders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes look, I have made it clear based on Senator Sanders' own record that he has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times.",0,0,0,0,1,1
He voted against the Brady Bill five times.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"He voted for what we call, the Charleston Loophole.",1,0,1,0,1,0
"He voted for immunity from gunmakers and sellers which the NRA said, ""was the most important piece of gun legislation in 20 years. """,0,0,1,0,1,1
"He voted to let guns go onto the Amtrak, guns go into National Parks.",0,0,1,0,1,1
He voted against doing research to figure out how we can save lives.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Let's not forget what this is about, 90 people a day die from gun violence in our country.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"That's 33,000 people a year.",0,0,0,0,1,1
One of the most horrific examples not a block from here where we had nine people murdered.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"Now, I am pleased to hear that Senator Sanders has reversed his position on immunity and I look forward to him joining with those members of congress who have already introduced legislation.",1,0,0,0,1,1
There is no other industry in America that was given the total pass that the gun makers and dealers were and that needs to be reversed.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"All right, Governor O'Malley, you signed tough gun control measures as governor of Maryland and there are a lot Democrats in the audience here in South Carolina who own guns.",0,0,0,0,1,1
This conversation might be worrying many of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They may be hearing, ""you want to take my guns.",0,1,1,1,0,0
What would you say to them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is what I would say Lester, look see, I've listened to Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders go back and forth on which of them has the most inconsistent record on gun safety legislation and I would have to agree with both of them.",0,0,0,1,0,1
They've both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I'm the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation.,0,0,0,0,1,0
This is very personal to me being from Baltimore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will never forget one occasion visiting a little boy in Johns' Hopkins Hospital, he was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery and that boy's head was pierced with a bullet.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And I remember visiting him, it did not kill him - I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"He was getting a birthday haircut, the age of three when drug dealers turned that barbershop into a shooting gallery, and that boys head was pierced with a bullet.",0,0,1,1,0,1

I remember visiting him and his mother in Johns Hopkins Hospital.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In his diapers with tubes running in and out of his head, same age as my little boy.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So, after the slaughter of the kids in Connecticut last year, we brought people together.",0,0,0,0,1,0
We did pass in our state comprehensive gun safety legislation.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"It did have a ban on combat assault weapons, universal background checks, and you know what?",0,0,0,1,1,0
We did not interrupt a single person's hunting season.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've never met a self respecting deer hunter that needed an AR-15 to down a deer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, so...",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
...we're able to actually do these things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Alright, Governor, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary Clinton, this is a community that has suffered a lot of heartache in the last year.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course, as you mentioned, the church shootings.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We won't forget the video of Walter Scott being shot in the back while running from police.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified, but it plays straight to the fears of many African American men that their lives are cheap.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Is that perception, or in your view, is it reality?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, sadly it's reality, and it has been heartbreaking, and incredibly outraging to see the constant stories of young men like Walter Scott, as you said, who have been killed by police officers.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Their needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, that requires a very clear, agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief.",0,0,0,0,0,0
One out of three African American men may well end up going to prison.,0,0,1,1,1,1
That's the statistic.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want people hear to think what we would be doing if it was one out of three white men, and very often, the black men are arrested, convicted and incarcerated ...",0,0,1,1,1,1
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
...for offensive that do not lead to the same results for white men.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So, we have a very serious problem that we can no longer ignore.",0,0,0,1,0,0
You time is up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, my next question is...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"...Well, I — look...",0,0,0,0,0,0
...,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's actually — actually my next question is to you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... Let me respond to what the secretary said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a criminal justice system which is broken.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"Who in America is satisfied that we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China?",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Disproportionately African American, and Latino.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Who is satisfied that 51% of African American young people are either unemployed, or underemployed?",0,0,0,0,1,1
Who is satisfied that millions of people have police records for possessing marijuana when the CEO's of Wall Street companies who destroyed our economy have no police records.,0,0,1,1,1,1

Senator Sanders...,0,0,0,0,0,0
... We need to take a very hard look at our...,0,0,0,0,0,0

No.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Not only did I vote against it, I helped lead the opposition.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"And what happened there is yes, it's easy to get rid of a two-bit dictator like Saddam Hussein, but there wasn't the kind of thought as to what happens the day after you get him and what kind of political vacuum occurs.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And who rises up?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"So I think that President Obama made a promise to the American people when he ran, and he said you know what, I'm going to do my best to bring American troops home.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"But the immediate task is to bring all interests together who want to destroy ISIS, including Russia, including Iran, including our Muslim allies to make that the major priority.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in all of that senator and secretary, I think we're leaving out something very important here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that is that we still don't have the human intelligence: overt, in terms of diplomatic intelligence or covert, to understand even what the heck happens as the secondary and tertiary effects of some of these things.",0,0,0,1,0,1

But here's an issue that we also should talk about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a $600 billion military budget.,0,0,0,1,1,1
It is a budget larger than the next eight countries'.,0,1,0,0,1,1
"Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union.",1,0,0,1,1,1
Very little of that budget — less than 10 percent — actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism.,1,0,0,1,1,1
We need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the Defense Department.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton...,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
...this is the first time that a spouse of a former president could be elected president.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"You have said that President Clinton would advise you on economic issues, but be specific, if you can.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Are you talking about a kitchen-table role on economics, or will he have a real policy role?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it'll start at the kitchen table, we'll see how it goes from there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I...,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"...I'm going to have the very best advisers that I can possibly have, and when it comes to the economy and what was accomplished under my husband's leadership and the '90s — especially when it came to raising incomes for everybody and lifting more people out of poverty than at any time in recent history — you bet.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"I'm going to ask for his ideas, I'm going ask for his advice, and I'm going use him as a goodwill emissary to go around the country to find the best ideas we've got, because I do believe, as he said, everything that's wrong with America has been solved somewhere in America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We just have to do more of it, and we have to reach out, especially into poor communities and communities of color, to give more people their own chance to get ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator sanders, a 30 second response, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Great ideas, Governor O'Malley, Secretary Clinton, but here's the truth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you have an administration stacked with Wall Street appointees, it ain't going to accomplish very much.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So here's a promise that I make — and I mentioned a moment ago how corrupt the system is — Goldman Sachs, paying a $5 billion fine, gives this country, in recent history, a Republican secretary of treasury, a Democratic secretary of treasury.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Here's a promise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If elected president, Goldman Sachs is not going to have — bring forth a secretary of treasury for a Sanders administration.",0,0,0,1,0,1
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Sanders, let me ask you a question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You called Bill Clinton's past transgressions, quote, ""totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable.""",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Senator, do you regret saying that?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was asked a question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, one of the things, Andrea, and I — that question annoys me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I cannot walk down the street — Secretary Clinton knows this — without being told how much I have to attack secretary Clinton, want to get me on the front pages of the paper, I'd make some vicious attack.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I have avoided doing that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Trying to run an issue-oriented campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
I was asked a question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You didn't have to answer it that way, though.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why did you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well — then if I don't answer it, then there's another front page, so it's yes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ laughter ],0,0,0,0,0,0
And I mean this seriously.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've been through this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, his behavior was deplorable.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Have I ever once said a word about that issue?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I have not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to debate Secretary Clinton, Governor O'Malley, on the issues facing the American people, not Bill Clinton's personal behavior.",0,0,0,0,0,0

We will take a break.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll continue from Charleston right after this.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Welcome back everybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Finally, before we go tonight, we set out here to understand points of differences between you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We believe we've learned a lot here, but before we leave, is there anything that you really wanted to say tonight that you haven't gotten a chance to say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, we'll start with Governor O'Malley.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ laughter ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Didn't see that coming, did you?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, but we're going to have to get 20 minutes to do it, so.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[ laughter ],0,0,0,0,0,0
...too long.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe there are many issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have 60 seconds for this?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sixty seconds, we'd appreciate it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are so many issues that we haven't been able to discuss here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have not fully discussed immigration reform, and the deplorable number of immigrant detention camps that our nation's now maintaining.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"We haven't discussed the shameful treatment that the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow Americans, are getting treated with by these hedge funds that are working them over.",0,0,0,1,1,1
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"We haven't discussed the fact that in our hemisphere we have the danger of nation-state failures because of drug traffickers; and Honduras, and Guatemala and El Salvador.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"I guess the bottom line is this, look we are a great people the way we act at home and abroad based on the beliefs that unite us.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Our belief in the dignity of every person, our belief in our own common good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is now challenge that is too great for us to overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times, new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're on the threshold of a new era of American progress and I believe we have only need to join forces together and cross that threshold into a new era of American prosperity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thanks a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well Lester, I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what's happening in Flint, Michigan and I think every single American should be outraged.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead contaminated water.,0,0,0,1,1,1
And the governor of that state acted as though he didn't really care.,0,0,0,1,0,1
He had request for help and he had basically stone walled.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"I'll tell you what, if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would've been action.",0,0,0,1,0,0
So I sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could to help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I issued a statement about what we needed to do and then I went on a T.V.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"show and I said, ""it was outrageous that the governor hadn't acted and within two hours he had.""",0,0,0,1,0,1
And that's time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to be a president who takes care of the big problems and the problems that are affecting the people of our country everyday.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Sanders?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Secretary Clinton was right and what I did which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of governor.",0,0,0,1,0,0
A man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, we are a great nation — and we've heard a lot of great ideas here tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's be honest and let's be truthful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining American democracy.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"We've got to get rid of Super PACs, we've got to get rid of Citizens' United and what we've got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes American democracy; which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"To say loudly and clearly,"" that the government of the United States of America belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well thank you and thanks to all of you for being here tonight shedding light on some of the differences as Americans get ready to vote.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I also want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and certainly my friend and colleague, Andrea Mitchell.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This has been great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's been a great spirited conversation and American people appreciate it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course, a great education isn't all we need in this new economy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"After all, it's not much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package, for 30 years, are sitting in this chamber.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Americans understand that at some point in their careers, they may have to retool and retrain.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they shouldn't lose what they've already worked so hard to build.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever; we shouldn't weaken them, we should strengthen them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's what the Affordable Care Act is all about.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It's about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we'll still have coverage.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Health care inflation has slowed.,0,0,1,0,1,1
And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, I'm guessing we won't agree on health care anytime soon.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But there should be other ways both parties can improve economic security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Say a hardworking American loses his job – we shouldn't just make sure he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that's ready to hire him.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"If that new job doesn't pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And even if he's going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the way we make the new economy work better for everyone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"America is about giving everybody willing to work a hand up, and I'd welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers without kids.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But there are other areas where it's been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years – namely what role the government should play in making sure the system's not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And here, the American people have a choice to make.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed, and there's red tape that needs to be cut.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But after years of record corporate profits, working families won't get more opportunity or bigger paychecks by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Food Stamp recipients didn't cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.,0,0,0,1,0,1
Immigrants aren't the reason wages haven't gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It's sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The rules should work for them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And this year I plan to lift up the many businesses who've figured out that doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders, their customers, and their communities, so that we can spread those best practices across America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This brings me to the second big question we have to answer as a country: how do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny Sputnik was up there.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"We didn't argue about the science, or shrink our research and development budget.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later, we were walking on the moon.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That spirit of discovery is in our DNA.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We're Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And over the past seven years, we've nurtured that spirit.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We've protected an open internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"We've launched next-generation manufacturing hubs, and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day.",0,0,0,0,1,0
But we can do so much more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources they've had in over a decade.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Tonight, I'm announcing a new national effort to get it done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And because he's gone to the mat for all of us, on so many issues over the past forty years, I'm putting Joe in charge of Mission Control.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For the loved ones we've all lost, for the family we can still save, let's make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Medical research is critical.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You'll be pretty lonely, because you'll be debating our military, most of America's business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it's a problem and intend to solve it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
But even if the planet wasn't at stake; even if 2014 wasn't the warmest year on record – until 2015 turned out even hotter – why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future?,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Here are the results.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills, and employs more Americans than coal – in jobs that pay better than average.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We're taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy – something environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Meanwhile, we've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly sixty percent, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Gas under two bucks a gallon ain't bad, either.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Now we've got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future – especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why I'm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"That way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21 st century transportation system.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"None of this will happen overnight, and yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"But the jobs we'll create, the money we'll save, and the planet we'll preserve – that's the kind of future our kids and grandkids deserve.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And that's why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there's a problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Period.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not even close.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.,1,0,0,0,1,1
Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that's the path to ruin.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead – they call us.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"As someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Economic headwinds blow from a Chinese economy in transition.,0,1,0,0,0,0

And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It's up to us to help remake that system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that means we have to set priorities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Both al Qaeda and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today's world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage.",0,0,1,1,0,1
They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country; they undermine our allies.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped.,0,0,0,1,0,1
But they do not threaten our national existence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the story ISIL wants to tell; that's the kind of propaganda they use to recruit.,0,0,0,1,1,0
"We don't need to build them up to show that we're serious, nor do we need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is representative of one of the world's largest religions.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We just need to call them what they are – killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed.",0,0,0,1,0,0
That's exactly what we are doing.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL's financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we are taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, and their weapons.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"We are training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"If this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of military force against ISIL.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"But the American people should know that with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"If you doubt America's commitment – or mine – to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"When you come after Americans, we go after you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our foreign policy must be focused on the threat from ISIL and al Qaeda, but it can't stop there.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"For even without ISIL, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world – in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in parts of Central America, Africa and Asia.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks; others will fall victim to ethnic conflict, or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet bomb civilians.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn't pass muster on the world stage.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"That's not leadership; that's a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"It's the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq – and we should have learned it by now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Fortunately, there's a smarter approach, a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us, and make sure other countries pull their own weight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we're partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"That's why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"As we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.",0,0,1,0,1,1
That's how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our military, our doctors, and our development workers set up the platform that allowed other countries to join us in stamping out that epidemic.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"That's how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"It cuts 18,000 taxes on products Made in America, and supports more good jobs.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"With TPP, China doesn't set the rules in that region, we do.",0,0,1,0,1,1

You want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Recognize that the Cold War is over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Lift the embargo.,0,0,1,0,0,0
American leadership in the 21 st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world – except when we kill terrorists; or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Leadership means a wise application of military power, and rallying the world behind causes that are right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It means seeing our foreign assistance as part of our national security, not charity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change – that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our children.",0,0,0,0,1,1

Number Five: Cancel Unconstitutional Executive Orders & Enforce All Immigration Laws,0,0,0,1,0,0
"We will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Hillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs -- including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the Supreme Court.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Clinton's plan would trigger a Constitutional Crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before.,0,0,1,1,1,0

"But, unlike this Administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement -- and ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation -- that is what it means to have laws and to have a country.,0,0,0,1,1,1

Number Six: We Are Going To Suspend The Issuance Of Visas To Any Place Where Adequate Screening Cannot Occur,0,0,0,1,1,1
"According to data provided to the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign-born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States.",0,0,1,1,1,1

Countries from which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"For the price of resettling 1 refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region.",0,1,0,0,1,1
Another reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include an ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan -- in these two countries, according to Pew research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Applicants will be asked for their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities, attitudes on Radical Islam, and many other topics as part of the vetting procedure.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Number Seven: We will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported,0,0,0,0,0,1
"There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they have been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals.",1,0,1,1,1,1
"Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into U.S. communities.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Yet, despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries, Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance.",0,0,1,1,1,1
The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"According to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Many of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch -- she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn't do it.",0,0,0,0,1,1

"Last year alone, nearly a half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Removing visa overstays will be a top priority of my Administration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never leave -- the Obama-Clinton policy -- then we have a completely open border.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We must send the message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants used some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs, like food stamps or housing assistance.",0,0,1,0,1,1

There will be no amnesty.,0,0,1,0,0,0

Those days are over.,0,0,0,0,0,0

All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is the only conversation we should be having at this time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas, or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing -- and the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"These are matters of life-and-death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton.",0,0,0,0,0,0

This first is an open question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This series of debates is essentially a job interview with the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in any job interview, you know this: you get asked, ""what's your biggest weakness?""",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Good question, but I want to tell you, my great concern is that we are on the verge, perhaps, of picking someone who cannot do this job.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I've watched to see people say that we should dismantle Medicare and Medicaid and leave the senior citizens out — out in the — in the cold.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"I try to live by the rules, no matter what they are, and I was brought up that way as a kid.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Play by the rules.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Thank you, Governor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor Bush.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"You gotta be — stick with it, and all that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But also, I can't fake anger.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe this is still the most extraordinary country on the face of the Earth.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And it troubles me that people are rewarded for tearing down our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's never been that way in American politics before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can't do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thank you for that question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would begin by saying that I'm not sure it's a weakness, but I do believe that I share a sense of optimism for America's future that, today, is eroding from too many of our people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think there's a sense in this country today that somehow our best days are behind us.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Our greatest days lie ahead if we are willing to do what it takes now.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Mr. Trump?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm too trusting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.",0,0,0,0,0,0

[ laughter ],0,0,0,0,0,0
Dr. Carson?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Probably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do, however, believe in Reagan's 11th commandment, and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And recognizing that it's so important, this election, because we're talking about America for the people versus America for the government.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Fixed it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I also think that these are very serious times; 75 percent of the American people think the federal government is corrupt.,0,0,0,1,1,1
I agree with them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And this big powerful, corrupt bureaucracy works now only for the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Meantime, wages have stagnated for 40 years.",0,1,1,0,1,1
We have more Americans out of work or just Americans who quit looking for work for 40 years.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Ours was intended to be a citizen government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is about more than replacing a D with an R. We need a leader who will help us take our government back.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm a fighter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am passionate about what I believe.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Governor Christie?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't see a lot of weakness on this stage, quite frankly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Where I see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the Democratic stage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I see a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And for the sake of me, I can't figure out which one is which.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when Barack Obama came into office around the world.,0,0,0,1,1,1
But I know who the pessimist is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's Hillary Clinton.,0,1,0,0,0,0

We borrow a million dollars a minute.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Now, on the floor of the Congress, the Washington establishment from both parties puts forward a bill that will explode the deficit.",0,0,1,1,1,1
It allows President Obama to borrow unlimited amounts of money.,0,0,0,0,1,1
I will stand firm.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will spend every ounce of energy to stop it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will begin tomorrow to filibuster it.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Dynamically.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They said that you have as chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your arms.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"If you were to took a 10 percent tax, with the numbers right now in total personal income, you're gonna come in with bring in $1.5 trillion.",0,0,0,1,1,1
That is less than half of what we bring in right now.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And by the way, it's gonna leave us in a $2 trillion hole.",0,0,0,1,1,0
So what analysis got you to the point where you think this will work?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I didn't say that the rate would be 10 percent.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I used the tithing analogy.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"I — I understand that, but if you — if you look at the numbers you probably have to get to 28.",0,0,0,1,0,1
The rate — the rate — the rate is gonna be much closer to 15 percent.,0,0,0,0,0,1
15 percent still leaves you with a $1.1 trillion hole.,0,0,0,1,1,1
You also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You also have to some strategically cutting in several places.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Right back to the questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Christie, we have spoken much about cutting spending, given the $19 trillion debt.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"But according to one report, America needs $3.6 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2020.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"Here in South Carolina, 11 percent of bridges are considered structurally deficient, costing drivers a billion dollars a year in auto repairs.",0,0,1,1,1,1
What is your plan to fix the ailing roads and bridges without breaking the bank?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's — here's our plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"If you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world — and we double tax, as you know.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And who can blame them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
They pay tax once overseas.,0,0,0,0,1,1
They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"So beside reforming that tax code, bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given — bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Bring the money — the $2 trillion — back to the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It would not necessitate us raising any taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And — and — and the last piece of this, Maria, is this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America.",0,0,1,1,0,1
He's penalized — and doesn't understand.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"You've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration.",0,0,1,1,1,1
That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And remember this — I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.",0,0,0,0,0,1

Here is the one thing I'm not going to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's called the value added tax.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Where basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"And that's why they have it in Europe, because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Now, you can support one now that's very low.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And therefore, they don't get the income tax break, but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.",0,0,1,1,1,1

"Yes, of course.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now, but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat.",0,0,0,0,0,1
A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.,0,1,0,0,1,1
This is a business flat tax.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It goes away.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It enables us to eliminate the death tax.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"If you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mine gives every American a simple, flat tax of 10 percent.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent.,0,0,0,0,1,1

Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...",0,0,1,0,0,0

"The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth, it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Thank you senator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[ applause ],0,0,0,0,0,0
But that's not an accurate description of the plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Someone's going to be collecting this tax.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found?",0,0,1,1,0,1
"That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"The second point, it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make.,0,0,1,0,1,1
They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.,0,0,1,0,1,1
So there are people watching tonight in business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.,0,0,0,0,1,0
You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...",0,0,0,1,0,0

Because what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Bernie Sanders has already said it.,0,0,0,0,1,1

"We have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress — this one that we have right now, just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund.",0,0,1,1,1,1

There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system.,0,0,0,1,1,0

"Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally.",0,0,1,1,1,1

"First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thirdly, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines...",0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
... which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Every problem can be solved.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And every hurting family can find healing and hope.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our citizens deserve this, and so much more, so why not join forces and finally get the job done and get it done right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave...",0,1,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"... to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan...",0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.",0,0,0,0,0,1
She was not expected to live past 5.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He founded a company to look for a cure and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame.,0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"If we slash the restraints, not just at the F.D.A.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind — and the souls — of every American child.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Education is the civil rights issue of our time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning — great learning center — with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Later this year, she will get her master's degree in social work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.,0,1,1,0,1,1
"[Fact check: True, but somewhat misleading.]",0,0,0,1,0,0
"In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.",0,0,1,0,1,1
This is not acceptable in our society.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school and to have access to a high-paying job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"But to create this future, we must work with — not against — not against — the men and women of law enforcement.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"We must build bridges of cooperation and trust, not drive the wedge of disunity and it's — really, it's what it is, division.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's pure, unadulterated division.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to unify.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Police and sheriffs are members of our community.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They're friends and neighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
And we must support the victims of crime.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"The office is called Voice, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media",0,0,0,0,0,0

Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college, where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But he never got the chance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jamiel, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Their husbands — Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis — were slain in the line of duty in California.,0,0,1,1,0,1
They were pillars of their community.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Should have never been in our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war — if they must — they have to fight and they only have to win.",1,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],1,0,0,0,0,0
"I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester...",1,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],1,0,0,0,0,0
... and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.,1,1,1,0,1,1
My budget will also increase funding for our veterans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
The challenges we face as a nation are great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But our people are even greater.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.,0,0,0,0,0,0

You know that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And he's very happy, because I think he just broke a record.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we will never forget Ryan.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe. We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars, that dethroned fascism...",1,0,0,0,1,1
[Applause],1,0,0,0,0,0
... and a Cold War and defeated communism.,1,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],1,0,0,0,0,0
But our partners must meet their financial obligations.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Very nice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost — have to do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And they have to respect our rights as a nation, also.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.",0,0,0,0,0,1
My job is not to represent the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My job is to represent the United States of America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We must learn from the mistakes of the past.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
All across the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding.",0,0,0,0,0,1

[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
Think of the marvels we could achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.,0,0,0,0,0,0
American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.,0,1,0,0,1,1

The time for small thinking is over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The time for trivial fights is behind us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears, inspired by the future, not bound by failures of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded by our doubts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Believe in yourselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Believe in your future.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, you and the administration said to North Korea, ""Don't test a missile.""",0,0,0,0,1,1
They have tested a missile.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Is the pressure not working?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I didn't say, ""Don't test a missile.""",0,0,1,1,0,0
He's going to have to do what he has to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But he understands we're not going to be very happy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will tell you, a man that I've gotten to like and respect, the president of China, President Xi, I believe, has been putting pressure on him also.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But so far, perhaps nothing's happened and perhaps it has.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This was a small missile.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This was not a big missile.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago.",0,0,0,1,1,1
We'll see what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You say, ""Not happy.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
What does that mean?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would not be happy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And I can tell you also, I don't believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Not happy mean military action?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't know.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I mean, we'll see.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Chinese, our allies, have been allies with North Korea.",0,0,0,0,1,1
How are you sure that they're not using this as a way to test you?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You can never be sure of anything, can you?",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I developed a very good relationship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think they want to see a destabilized North Korea.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I don't think they want to see it.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They certainly don't want to see nuclear on -- from their neighbor.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They haven't liked it for a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we'll have to see what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The relationship I have with China, it's been already acclaimed as being something very special, something very different than we've ever had.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But again, you know, we'll find out whether or not President Xi is able to affect change.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why do--,0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope he is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why do these missiles keep blowing up?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, I'd rather not discuss it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But perhaps they're just not very good missiles.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"But eventually, he'll have good missiles.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't want to discuss it because maybe we have something to do with it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just don't want to discuss it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think you know me very well, where you've asked me many times over the last couple of years about military.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, ""We shouldn't be announcing we're going into Mosul.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, ""We shouldn't be announcing all our moves.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is a chess game.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just don't want people to know what my thinking is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So eventually, he will have a better delivery system.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if that happens, we can't allow it to happen.",0,0,0,1,0,0
What do you make of the North Korean leader?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have -- I really, you know, have no comment on him.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"People are saying, ""Is he sane?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have no idea.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I can tell you this, and a lot of people don't like when I say it, but he was a young man of 26 or 27 when he took over from his father, when his father died.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"He's dealing with obviously very tough people, in particular the generals and others.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And at a very young age, he was able to assume power.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A lot of people, I'm sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And he was able to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have a situation that we just cannot let -- we cannot let what's been going on for a long period of years continue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And frankly, this should've been done and taken care of by the Obama administration.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Should've been taken care of by the Bush administration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Should've been taken care of by Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me ask you a question about the presidency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
George W. Bush said this about being president.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"He said, ""You think one thing going in, and then the pressures of the job or the realities of the world are different than you thought.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you agree?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think I can agree with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I love doing it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm, you know, thoroughly enjoying it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's always a challenge, like life itself is a challenge.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it's something that I really love and I think I've done a very good job at it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You said in an interview with Reuters that you thought it would be easier.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it's a tough job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I've had a lot of tough jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've had things that were tougher, although I'll let you know that better at the end of eight years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Perhaps eight years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hopefully, eight years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'll let you know later on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we've done very well with foreign policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think we've done very, very well with relationships with other leaders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we're doing great on trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's set.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we're doing well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, our country is being out-traded at every single point.",0,0,1,1,0,0
We're losing tremendous amounts of money on trade.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"And I think actually, I've been very consistent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, it's very funny when the fake media goes out, you know, which we call the mainstream media which sometimes, I must say, is you.",0,0,0,1,0,0
You mean me personally or?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, your show.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I love your show.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I call it Deface the Nation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, you know, your show is sometimes not exactly correct.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when they talk about currency manipulation, and I did say I would call China, if they were, a currency manipulator, early in my tenure.",0,0,0,1,1,1
And then I get there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, they -- as soon as I got elected, they stopped.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"They're not -- it's not going down anymore, their currency.",0,1,0,1,1,1
But that had been true before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That had been true--,0,0,0,1,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"--during the campaign, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, not true to the extent that we're talking about.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Much more important than that, as to when, but, you know, it did stop.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I was talking about it all during the campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I would say that I was the one that got them to stop.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But forget that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You were the one who got China--,0,0,0,0,1,0
He is working with us--,0,0,0,0,0,0
--to stop manipulating their currency?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I think so, during the campaign I talked about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Even if they were doing it before?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, they were doing it before.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"I mean, there was no question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, they were absolute currency manipulators before.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"But somebody said, ""Oh, you didn't call him a currency manipulator.""",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Now, you and I are just talking about how he's working -- I believe that President Xi is working to try and resolve a very big problem, for China also.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And that's North Korea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Can you imagine if I say, ""Hey, by the way, how are you doing with North Korea?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Also, we're going to announce that you're a currency manipulator tomorrow.""",0,0,0,1,0,0
So the mainstream media never talks about that.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They never say that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And that's, you know, unfortunate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's just--,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me--,0,0,0,0,0,0
"--it's just one of many things, John.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You're a negotiator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you need something from somebody, you need China to help you with North Korea, doesn't that send a message to China, ""We're not going to bug you about human rights, about intellectual property.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"In the South China Sea we're not going to put too much heat on you""?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Aren't you breaking one of your own negotiating rules?,0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that, frankly, North Korea is maybe more important than trade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Trade is very important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But massive warfare with millions, potentially millions of people being killed?",0,0,1,1,0,0
"That, as we would say, trumps trade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me ask you--,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You understand what I'm saying.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if I can use trade as a method to get China, because I happen to think that China does have reasonably good powers over North Korea.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, maybe not, you know, ultimate, but pretty good powers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, if China can help us with North Korea and can solve that problem--",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me ask--,0,0,0,0,0,0
"--that's worth making not as good a trade deal for the United States, excuse me, right?",0,0,0,1,0,0
What do you know now on day 100 that you wish you knew on day one of the presidency?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, one of the things that I've learned is how dishonest the media is, really.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've done things that are I think very good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've set great foundations with foreign leaders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have you know -- NAFTA, as you know, I was going to terminate it, but I got a very nice call from a man I like, the president of Mexico.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"I got a very nice call from Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And they said please would you rather than terminating NAFTA -- I was all set to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, I was going to do it today.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was going to do as we're sitting here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would've had to delay you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was going to do it today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was going to terminate NAFTA.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But they called up and they said, ""Would you negotiate?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I said, ""Yes, I will negotiate.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's all you've learned, about the media?",0,0,0,0,0,0
You knew from the campaign about the media.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You said it all the time --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, but the media didn't cover it that way.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"The media said, oh, I didn't terminate NAFTA.",0,0,1,1,1,0
So--,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, if you look at my statements, I said--",0,0,0,0,1,0
"No, no, I meant--",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, I will terminate NAFTA.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, I'll make that statement right now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's a question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, we will terminate NAFTA.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Let's step back a minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Presidents have to learn how to adapt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Every president comes into the job, it's different than they expect, they must adapt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Surely, you've learned something else other than that the media is dishonest.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"No, no, I'm just saying--",0,0,0,0,0,0
And how do you adapt?,0,0,0,0,0,0
--it was one of my disappointments.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Give me another thing you learned that you're going to adapt and change because all presidents have to at this stage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think things generally tend to go a little bit slower than you'd like them to go.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just a system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's just a very, very bureaucratic system.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I think the rules in Congress and in particular the rules in the Senate are unbelievably archaic and slow moving.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And in many cases, unfair.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In many cases, you're forced to make deals that are not the deal you'd make.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You'd make a much different kind of a deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're forced into situations that you hate to be forced into.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I also learned, and this is very sad, because we have a country that we have to take care of.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Democrats have been totally obstructionist.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Chuck Schumer has turned out to be a bad leader.,0,0,0,1,0,0
He's a bad leader for the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the Democrats are extremely obstructionist.,0,0,0,1,0,0
All they do is obstruct.,0,0,0,1,0,0
All they do is delay.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Even our Supreme Court justice, as you know, who I think is going to be outstanding, Justice Gorsuch.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that it was disgraceful the way they handled that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, you know, I still have people, I'm waiting for them to be approved.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our chief trade negotiator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can't get these people through.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to get to--,0,0,0,0,0,0
They are obstructionists.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And you know what that's hurting?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's hurting the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me ask you about health care -- Tucker Carlson interviewed you about six weeks ago when you were in the middle of health care negotiations.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And you agreed with him that the health care bill wasn't going to help your supporters.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"That those who lived in rural areas, the older, were going to get hurt by that bill.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And you told him--,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Excuse me, the health care bill is going to help my supporters.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, hold on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me just finish the question, if I may, sir--",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Otherwise, I'm not going to sign it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not going to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, this is why I wanted to ask you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You said to Tucker, ""We will take care of our people, or I am not signing it.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
You said you were going to negotiate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that's what I just said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So tell me what in the bill you've been negotiating to get--,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me--,0,0,0,0,0,0
--in that helps your supporters.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm just trying to get the details of how your people--,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
--will be helped.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Pre-existing conditions are in the bill.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, ""Pre-existing is not covered.""",0,0,0,0,1,1
Pre-existing conditions are in the bill.,0,0,0,1,1,1
And I mandate it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, ""Has to be.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
So--,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have, we're going to have lower premiums.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And before you start there, let me just tell you something.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Obamacare is dead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obamacare right now, all the insurance companies are fleeing.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Places like Tennessee have already lost half of their state with the insurance companies.,0,0,1,0,1,1
They're all going.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obamacare, John, is dead.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Okay, because we're being -- we're being compared to Obamacare.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just, so.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Obamacare doesn't work--,0,0,0,1,0,0
I just want to compare you to your own.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, it's important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've got to compare it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, no, but I want--",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you were saying about Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, but I'm not.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm asking what--,0,0,0,0,0,0
With Obamacare--,0,0,0,0,0,0
--you're going to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
--the premiums are too high.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"The deductibles are through the roof, so you never get to use it.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"But more importantly, it's dead.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So but in the bill, as it was analyzed, there were two problems.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"One, and you talked about this with Congressman Robert Aderholt, who brought you the example of the 64-year-old who under Obamacare the premiums--",0,0,0,0,1,1
"But that was a long time ago, John.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But has that been fixed?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Totally fixed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've made many changes to the bill.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"You know, this bill is--",0,0,0,0,0,0
What kind though?,0,0,0,0,0,0
--very much different than it was three weeks ago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Help us explain because there are people--,0,0,0,0,0,0
The bill--,0,0,0,0,0,0
--out there wondering what kind of changes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me explain.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me explain it to you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay?",0,0,0,0,0,1
This bill has evolved.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And we didn't have a failure on the bill.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, it was reported like a failure.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"Now, the one thing I wouldn't have done again is put a timeline.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why on the second iteration, I didn't put a timeline.",0,0,0,0,1,1
But we have now pre-existing conditions in the bill.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We have -- we've set up a pool for the pre-existing conditions so that the premiums can be allowed to fall.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We're taking across all of the borders or the lines so that insurance companies can compete--,0,0,0,0,1,0
But that's not in--,0,0,0,0,0,0
--nationwide.,0,0,0,0,0,0
--this bill.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The borders are not in--,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course, it's in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
--this bill.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's in that third bill, right, because--",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's in the second phase.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's called phase one, phase two.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's, in effect, second phase, which will get approved, which will quickly get approved.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me--,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me just explain something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There will be such competition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, there's no competition.",0,0,0,0,0,1
There will be such competition by insurance companies so that they can get health care and the people taking care of health care.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So--,0,0,0,0,0,0
The other thing we're going to have is groups.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Groups of people can negotiate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What's going to happen is the competition is going to drive down the premiums.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"In my opinion, much, much more than people understand.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So what you've just described is the bill that you previously had said you worried wouldn't help your people.,0,0,0,1,1,0
And here's why I ask.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You said, ""Pre-existing conditions.""",0,0,0,1,0,0
"No, there were things in the other bill, the first version, which were not as good.",0,0,0,1,1,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when I watch some of the news reports, which are so unfair, and they say we don't cover pre-existing conditions, we cover it beautifully.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Although--,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll tell you who doesn't cover pre-existing conditions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's dead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In one of the fixes that was--,0,0,0,0,1,0
It's not going to be here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In one of the fixes it was discussed pre-existing was optional for the states--,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Sure, in one of the fixes.",0,0,0,0,1,0
And they're changing it--,0,0,0,0,1,0
"--oh, okay.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So it'll--,0,0,0,0,0,0
--and changing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
--be permanent?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that's a development, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So you're saying it's going to be pre-existing to everybody?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"John, this has evolved over a period of three or four weeks.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, we really have a good bill.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think they could have voted on Friday.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, ""Just relax.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Don't worry about this phony 100 day thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just relax.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take it easy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take your time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Get the good vote and make it perfect.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
Just to--,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Most importantly, we're going to drive down premiums.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to drive down deductibles because right now, deductibles are so high, you never -- unless you're going to die a long, hard death, you never can get to use your health care--",0,0,0,0,1,1
Let me ask you something--,0,0,0,0,0,0
--because the deductibles are so high.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So what I hear you saying is pre-existing is going to be in there for everybody, it's not going to be up to the states?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Pre-existing is going to be in there and we're also--,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's not up to the states?,0,0,0,0,0,0
--going to create pools.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And pools are going to take care of the pre-existing.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But on that crucial question, it's not going to be left up to the states?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Everybody gets pre-existing, no matter where they live?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, but the states--",0,0,1,0,0,0
Guaranteed?,0,0,0,0,0,0
--are also going to have a lot to do with it because we ultimately want to get it back down to the states.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is it a guarantee?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, because if you hurt your knee, honestly, I'd rather have the federal government focused on North Korea, focused on other things, than your knee, okay?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Or than your back, as important as your back is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would much rather see the federal government focused on other things--,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
--bigger things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, the state is going to be in a much better position to take care, because it's smaller.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"People out there with pre-existing conditions, they are worried.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Are they going to have the guarantee of coverage if they have a pre-existing condition or if they live in a state where the governor decides that's not a part of the health care, or that the prices are going to go up?",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's the worry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The American Medical Association says--,0,0,0,0,0,0
We actually--,0,0,0,0,0,0
--it could effectively make coverage completely unaffordable for people.,0,0,0,1,1,1
"--we actually have, well, forget about unaffordable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What's unaffordable is Obamacare, John.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I'm not hearing you, Mr. President, say there's a guarantee of pre-existing conditions.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We actually have -- we actually have a clause that guarantees.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Okay, excellent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We got there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a specific clause--,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me ask you--,0,0,0,0,0,0
--that guarantees.,0,0,0,0,0,0
--about your tax plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Go ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Tax plan came out this week.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It's got some big deficit numbers.,0,0,1,1,1,0
You've said that's going to be made up by growth.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Congressional--,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, not only growth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to be made up by better trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to be made up--,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"--by many different, reciprocal tax.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"As an example, we have countries where if we make a product and we send it to that country, they charge us 100% tax.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"If they make the same product and send it to us, we charge them nothing.",0,0,0,0,1,1
You think that's smart?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Look--,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to come up with reciprocal taxes and lots of other things on those countries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I view that more in trade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're also going to fix all of our trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have a very wealthy country again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me ask you this, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Congress may not go along with--,0,0,0,1,0,0
Always.,0,0,0,0,0,0
--so they're going to try and find some spending.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me ask you about the question of Medicare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They're going to want, in Congress, to make up on the spending side, to change Medicare.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Will you allow that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're not going to have to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, sir, will you allow it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
You're not going to have to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm just telling you we are--,0,0,0,0,0,0
Does President Donald Trump want them not to do that?,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I would much prefer them not to do that, that's right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It sounds as if, having covered you in the campaign, it sounds like you're leaving the door open.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the campaign, you were quite clear.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You said, ""I'm the guy who's not going to touch Medicare.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, then let me more clear.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm not going to touch it, because I said it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, waste, fraud and abuse, I'm going to touch.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"If there's something in Medicare that's been abused, I will touch that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are certain things, as you know, that have been absolutely abused.",0,0,0,1,0,0
There are certain provisions in Medicare that are horrible and abusive and there's been terrible things happening.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So that kind of stuff, I will absolutely touch.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So if I--,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the concept of Medicare, I'm not touching.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For me, if I have it now, or if I'm going to have it in the future, it's not getting cut?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Waste, fraud and abuse.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And that's it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if there are things within Medicare that are being abused, I will touch that also.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Other than that, it's tightened up?",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But here's what we do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to grow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The numbers just came out for Obama's last year.,0,0,0,0,1,1
1.6 GDP.,0,0,1,0,1,0
That means nothing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's, like, 1% GDP.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So I have gotten to know as you know, I really get along with a lot of other countries.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I talk to the heads of countries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How are you doing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not well, not well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
GDP is 8%.,0,0,1,0,1,1
GDP is 9%.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We are doing poorly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"GDP -- Our GDP is, like, 1%.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Let me ask you about your tax returns, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When your Treasury secretary was asked about whether you were going to release them, Secretary Mnuchin said, ""The president has no intention.""",0,0,1,0,1,1

But I never heard it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I had already shaken her hand four times.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, because we were together for a long time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Did you expect you would have good chemistry with her?,0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because, um, I'm at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I'm at odds on immigration.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We had unbelievable chemistry.,0,0,0,0,0,0

He's going to end up paying.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you know, nobody ever asked the question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody asked.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody ever asked him to pay up.,0,0,1,0,1,0
So it's a different kind of a presidency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do you feel like that's one thing that you've changed, that you maybe are actually asking the direct questions about some of these things?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me give me an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet.,0,0,1,1,0,1
It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget.,0,0,1,1,1,1
It was seven years behind schedule.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It was a disaster.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"So I called in Lockheed and I said, ""I'm sorry, we're going to have to bid this out to another company, namely Boeing,"" or whoever else.",0,0,1,1,0,1
But Boeing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I called in Boeing and I started getting competing offers back and forth...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I saved $725 million on the 90 planes.,1,0,1,0,1,1
Just 90.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered.",0,0,0,0,1,1
On 90 planes I saved $725 million.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"It's actually a little bit more than that, but it's $725 million.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Gen. Mattis, who had to sign the deal when it came to his office, said, ""I've never seen anything like this in my life.""",0,0,1,0,1,1
We went from a company that wanted more money for the planes to a company that cut.,0,1,1,0,1,1
"And the reason they cut -- same planes, same everything -- was because of me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, because that's what I do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now if you multiply that times 3,000 planes, you know this is on 90 planes.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"In fact, when the Prime Minister Abe of Japan came in because they bought a certain number of those...",0,0,1,0,1,1
"The first thing he said to me, because it was right at the time I did it, he said, ""Could I thank you?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, ""What?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said, ""You saved us $100 million.""",0,0,1,0,1,1
Because they got a $100 million savings on the 10 or 12 planes that they bought.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Nobody wrote that story.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"Now you know that's a saving of billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars over the course of -- it's between 2,500 and 3,000 planes will be the final order.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"But this was only 90 of those 2,500 planes.",0,0,1,1,1,1
And you expect those savings to carry out across that full order?,0,0,0,0,0,0
More.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm gonna get more than that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This was a thing that was out of control and now it's great. And the woman that runs Lockheed, Marillyn",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Hewson],0,0,0,0,0,0
", she was great.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But all of a sudden it was a different kind of a thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you feel like you've been able to apply that kind of a relationship to your dealings with Congress as well?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have great relationships with Congress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we're doing very well and I think we have a great foundation for future things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to be applying, I shouldn't tell you this, but we're going to be announcing, probably on Wednesday, tax reform.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"And you've got to understand, I've only been here now 93 days, 92 days.",0,0,0,0,0,1
President Obama took 17 months to do Obamacare.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"I've been here 92 days but I've only been working on the health care, you know I had to get like a little bit of grounding right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Health care started after 30 day, so I've been working on health care for 60 days...You know, we're very close.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And it's a great plan, you know, we have to get it approved.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Is it this deal that's between the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus, is that the deal you're looking at?",0,0,0,0,1,0
"So the Republican Party has various groups, all great people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They're great people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But some are moderate, some are very conservative.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Democrats don't seem to have that nearly as much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know the Democrats have, they don't have that.",0,0,0,1,0,0
The Republicans do have that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's fine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you know there's a pretty vast area in there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have a great relationship with all of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, we have government not closing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think we'll be in great shape on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going very well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obviously, that takes precedent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That takes precedent over health care?,0,0,0,0,0,0
For next week?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, sure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Next week.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because the hundred days is just an artificial barrier.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The press keeps talking about the hundred days.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But we've done a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have a list of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't have to read it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You did put out though, as a candidate, you put out a 100-day plan.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Do you feel like you should be held accountable to that plan?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Somebody, yeah, somebody put out the concept of a hundred-day plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm mostly there on most items. Go over the items, and I'll talk to you ...",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Crosstalk],0,0,0,0,0,0
But things change.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There has to be flexibility.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me give you an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"President Xi, we have a, like, a really great relationship.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For me to call him a currency manipulator and then say, ""By the way, I'd like you to solve the North Korean problem,"" doesn't work.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So you have to have a certain flexibility, Number One.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number Two, from the time I took office till now, you know, it's a very exact thing.",0,0,0,0,1,1
It's not like generalities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you want a Coke or anything?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm OK, thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
No...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Because there's a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he's helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, ""By the way, would you help us with North Korea?",0,0,0,1,0,0
"And also, you're a currency manipulator.""",0,0,0,1,0,0
It doesn't work that way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you know some of them either don't get it, in which case they're very stupid people, or they just don't want to say it.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You know because of a couple of them said, ""He didn't call them a currency manipulator.""",0,0,1,1,0,1
"Well, for two reasons.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number One, he's not, since my time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, very specific formula.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You would think it's like generalities, it's not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They have -- they've actually -- their currency's gone up.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"So it's a very, very specific formula.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I said, ""How badly have they been,""... they said, ""Since you got to office they have not manipulated their currency.""",0,0,1,1,1,1
"That's Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Now maybe that'll work out or maybe it won't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you imagine?,0,0,0,0,0,0
...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So in terms of the 100-day plan that you did put out during the campaign, do you feel, though, that people should hold you accountable to this in terms of judging success?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, because much of the foundation's been laid.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Things came up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll give you an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I didn't put Supreme Court judge on the 100 day plan, and I got a Supreme Court judge.",0,0,1,0,1,0
I think it's on there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't know...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Begin the process of selecting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You actually exceeded on this one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This says, ""Begin the process of selecting a replacement.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's the biggest thing I've done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you consider that your biggest success?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I -- first of all I think he's a great man.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think he will be a great, great justice of the Supreme Court.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have always heard that the selection and the affirmation of a Supreme Court judge is the biggest thing a president can do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Don't forget, he could be there for 40 years....",0,0,0,0,0,0
He's a young man.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've always heard that that's the biggest thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I would say that defense is the biggest thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, to be honest, there are a number of things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I've always heard that the highest calling is the nomination of a Supreme Court justice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've done one in my first 70 days.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our military is so proud.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They were not proud at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They had their heads down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now they have their heads up...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm rebuilding the military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have great people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have great things in place.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have tremendous borders.,0,0,0,0,0,0

[Haider al],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Abadi left from Iraq, he said Trump has more success in eight weeks than Obama had in eight years.... We have had tremendous success, but we don't talk about it.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We don't talk about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you mean you don't talk about it personally because you don't want to talk about it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't talk about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the generals don't talk about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You had put a request into the Pentagon to put forward an ISIS plan within 30 days.,0,0,0,1,1,0
I know they have sent that over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Have you accepted a plan?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are you moving forward on a strategy?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have a very strong plan, but we cannot talk about it, Julie.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So you have decided on a plan?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Remember how many times have you been to the speech where I talked about Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Four months we are going in, three months.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We are still fighting Mosul.,0,0,0,0,1,0
You know why?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because they were prepared.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we would have gone in and just done it, it would have been over three months ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you say generally what the strategy is?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Should people --,0,0,0,0,0,0
Generally is we have got to get rid of ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have no choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And other terrorist organizations.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Should Americans who are serving in the military expect that you are going to increase troop numbers in the Middle East to fight ISIS?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, not much.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"In terms of the strategy, though, that you have accepted, it sounds like, from the generals --",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, they've also accepted my strategy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Does that involve more troops on the ground, it sounds like?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Not many.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So a small increase?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It could be an increase, then an increase.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But not many more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to do the job, but not many more....",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is an important story.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've done a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've done more than any other president in the first 100 days and I think the first 100 days is an artificial barrier.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm scheduled... the foundations have been set to do some great things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
With foreign countries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look at, look at President Xi.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I mean ...,0,0,0,0,0,0
What do you think it was about your chemistry?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We had good chemistry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now I don't know that I think that's going to produce results but you've got a good chance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Uh-huh.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, he turned down many coal ships.",0,0,1,0,1,1
These massive coal ships are coming where they get a lot of their income.,0,0,1,0,0,1
They're coming into China and they're being turned away.,0,0,0,1,0,0
That's never happened before.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"The fuel, the oil, so many different things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You saw the editorial they had in their paper saying they cannot be allowed to have nuclear, you know, et cetera.",0,0,1,1,0,1
People have said they've never seen this ever before in China.,0,0,1,1,0,1
We have the same relationship with others.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's a great foundation that's built.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Great foundation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's going to produce tremendous results for our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One more 100 days question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's fine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
... is do you think you have the right team in place for your next 100 days?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think my team has been, well, I have different teams.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think my military team has been treated with great respect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
As they should be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think my other team hasn't been treated with the respect that they should get.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have some very talented people, and very diverse people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you mean your White House team when you say that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, my White House team.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think Reince has been doing an excellent job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that, you know, this is a very tough environment not caused necessarily by me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Although the election has, you know, look, the Democrats had a tremendous opportunity because the electoral college, as I said, is so skewed to them.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"You start off by losing in New York and California, no matter who it is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If, if Abe Lincoln came back to life, he would lose New York and he would lose California.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"It's just the registration, there's nothing you can do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So you're losing the two biggest states, that's where you start.",0,0,0,0,1,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Electoral College is so skewed in favor of a Democrat that it's very, very hard.",0,0,0,1,1,0
Look at Obama's number in the Electoral College.,0,0,0,0,0,0
His numbers on the win were... but the Electoral College numbers were massive.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"You lose New York, you lose Illinois.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Illinois is impossible to win.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"And you look at, so now you lose New York, Illinois, no matter what you do, and California.",0,0,0,1,1,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you say, man.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now you have to win Florida, you have to win Ohio, you have to win North Carolina.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You have to win all these states, and then I won Wisconsin and Michigan and all of these other places, but you remember there was no way to, there was no way to 270.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So she had this massive advantage, she spent hundreds of millions of dollars more money than I spent.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Hundreds of millions... Yeah.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Or more, actually because we were $375 she was at $2.2 billion.",0,0,1,1,1,1
But whatever.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She spent massive amounts of money more and she lost.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"Solidly lost, because you know it wasn't 270, it was 306.",0,0,1,0,1,1
So there's anger.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there was massive anger before I got there, so it's not easy for a White House staff to realize that you are going into a situation where you are going to be at no, where are going to get no votes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, here's a judge who is No.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"1 at Columbia, No.",0,0,0,0,0,0
1 at Harvard and an Oxford scholar.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And he got three votes.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Three Democratic votes, but yeah.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Three Democratic votes.,0,0,0,0,1,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's an Oxford scholar at the highest level.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"1, you know, one of the great academics, one of the great writers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
No bad decisions with all... nothing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's like a ...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you think that you can break through that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I mean this --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, I do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Is one of the biggest challenges for a president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think I can to an extent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there's a, there's a basic hard-line core that you can't break though, OK, that you can't break through.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There's a hard-line group you can't break through, you can't.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's sad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I met with Congressman Cummings and I really liked him, a lot.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Elijah Cummings.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I really liked him a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And during the conversation because we have a very strong mutual feeling on drug prices.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He came to see me, at my invitation, because I saw him talking about, he came to see me about drug prices because drug prices are ridiculous.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"And I am going to get them way, way, way down and he liked that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He said you will be the greatest president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said you will be, in front of five, six people, he said you will be the greatest president in the history of this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He disputed that slightly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what he said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, what can I tell you?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's six people sitting here.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"What did he, what, what do you mean by slightly?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said, he said that he felt like you could be a great president if and then --",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well he said, you'll be the greatest president in the history of, but you know what, I'll take that also, but that you could be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But he said, will be the greatest president but I would also accept the other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In other words, if you do your job, but I accept that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Then I watched him interviewed and it was like he never even was here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's incredible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I watched him interviewed a week later and it's like he was never in my office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you can even say that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's one of the difficulties I think presidents have had is that you can have these personal relationships with people from the other party, but then it's hard to actually change how people vote or change how people --",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No I have, it's interesting, I have, seem to get very high ratings.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I definitely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know Chris Wallace had 9.2 million people, it's the highest in the history of the show.",0,0,1,0,1,1
I have all the ratings for all those morning shows.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I go, they go double, triple.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Chris Wallace, look back during the Army-Navy football game, I did his show that morning.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I remember, right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It had 9.2 million people.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"It's the highest they've ever had. On any, on air,",0,0,1,0,1,1
[John],0,0,0,0,0,0

"It's the highest for ""Deface the Nation"" since the World Trade Center.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Since the World Trade Center came down.,0,0,1,0,1,1
It's a tremendous advantage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have learned one thing, because I get treated very unfairly, that's what I call it, the fake media.",0,0,0,1,0,0
And the fake media is not all of the media.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"You know they tried to say that the fake media was all the, no.",0,0,0,1,0,0
The fake media is some of you.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I could tell you who it is, 100 percent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sometimes you're fake, but -- but the fake media is some of the media.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It bears no relationship to the truth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's not that Fox treats me well, it's that Fox is the most accurate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you believe that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That Fox --,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I get treated so badly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yesterday, about the thing, you know when I said it's a terrorism... it may be.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I said it may be a terrorist attack and MSNBC, I heard, went crazy, ""He called it a terrorist attack.""",0,0,1,1,0,1
They thought it was a bank robbery.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"By the way, I'm 10-0 for that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've called every one of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Every time they said I called it way too early and then it turns out I'm... Whatever.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Whatever.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the meantime, I'm here and they're not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you feel that one of the things with cable is there's such real-time reaction with everything you say?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you separate that sometimes from that actual decision?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The one thing --,0,0,0,0,0,0
That you have to do --,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The one thing I've learned to do that I never thought I had the ability to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't watch CNN anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You just said you did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No. No, I, if I'm passing it, what did I just say",0,0,0,1,0,0
[Inaudible],0,0,0,0,0,0
?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You just said --,0,0,0,0,0,0
Where?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Where?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Two minutes ago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, they treat me so badly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I just said that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"No, I, what'd I say, I stopped watching them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I don't watch CNN anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't watch MSNBC.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I don't watch it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now I heard yesterday that MSNBC, you know, they tell me what's going on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, they also did.",0,0,0,0,1,0
I never thought I had the ability to not watch.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Like, people think I watch ""Morning Joe.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't watch ""Morning Joe.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I never thought I had the ability to, and who used to treat me great by the way, when I played the game.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I never thought I had the ability to not watch what is unpleasant, if it's about me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Or pleasant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But when I see it's such false reporting and such bad reporting and false reporting that I've developed an ability that I never thought I had.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I don't watch things that are unpleasant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just don't watch them.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And do you feel like that's, that's because of the office that you now occupy --",0,0,0,0,0,0
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That you've made that change?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't know why it is, but I've developed that ability, and it's happened over the last, over the last year.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's interesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I don't watch things that I know are going to be unpleasant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
CNN has covered me unfairly and incorrectly and I don't watch them anymore.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"A lot of people don't watch them anymore, they're now in third place.",0,0,1,0,0,1
But I've created something where people are watching... but I don't watch CNN anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't watch MSNBC anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't watch things, and I never thought I had that ability.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I always thought I'd watch.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just don't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's taken place over the last year.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And you know what that is, that's a great, it's a great thing because you leave, you leave for work in the morning you know, you're, you don't watch this total negativity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I never thought I'd be able to do that and for me, it's so easy to do now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Just don't watch.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's interesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe it's because I'm here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't know.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Mr. President, I am so glad to see you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm so proud of everything you're doing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me ask you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have just gotten back from the G-20.,0,0,0,0,1,0
You were traveling around the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What do you see as the major problem facing the world today?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What's the major issue?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well we have many problems.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I was left a very, very tough meal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will say that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was a mess.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we're doing very well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But North Korea certainly is a big problem.,0,0,0,1,0,0
The; Middle East is a total mess.,0,0,0,1,0,0
Other than in five months we have done more against ISIS than anybody has done since the beginning.,0,0,1,0,1,1
And we're having tremendous success with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I would have to say, Middle East is a tough situation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we're getting it straightened out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And ultimately, we want to start investing money back in the United States at our home.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have to get rid of ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to get rid of the terrorists, as you know better than anybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And the other is North Korea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have somebody that is -- we will find out what he is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to find out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has launched intercontinental missiles.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Is there a possibility that we might want to knock some of those down on the launch pad or right after launch?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we wouldn't want to be speaking about anything.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we're looking at lots of different ways.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're working with other countries, including China.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I think China would like to see this problem go away.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a big problem for them.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And, you know, the advantage we have is trade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have big trade with China.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And I have a very good relationship with President Xi, who I like a lot.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think he likes me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We were just spending a lot of time together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they are very strong with regard to, as you know, with regard to North Korea.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Will they get tough with North Korea?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know that you were so close when he was there visiting Mar-a-Lago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we're going to see.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would say that we had a good chance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They had an election where President Moon got elected to South Korea.,0,0,1,0,0,1
He has a much different attitude -- or a much different take -- on how to handle this situation than his predecessor in South Korea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He's perhaps softer on the issue, but maybe not, because I like him a lot.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think he's going to be a strong person.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think he's got strong views -- stronger than people would understand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we'll see how it all works out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think China wants to help us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to find out whether or not they do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But China would, in my opinion, like to be able to help us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What's our leverage with them?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, our leverage with China is that China makes hundreds of billions of dollars a year with us on trade.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And I want to renegotiate trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I would certainly be a lot easier in a trade deal if they were going to help us with North Korea than if they weren't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we're going to see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The relationship is very good with China.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's very good with the president of China, who's a terrific person.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We will find out whether or not they want to help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And maybe they do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And maybe they don't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What about that consortium of Arab nations that went against Qatar.,0,0,0,1,1,0
Your secretary of state was not too favorable to what was being done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How are we going to handle that one?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Rex is doing a terrific job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But he and I had a little bit of a difference, only in terms of tone.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So we went to Saudi Arabia.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We had one of the great meetings ever -- 54 Muslim countries.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And I got up, made a speech, got nice reviews.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's almost like you making a speech.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I said, we've got to stop the funding of terrorism.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"Tremendous money, and they're funding terrorism.",0,0,1,1,1,1
So we've got to stop it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So they are working very hard on that.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And I believe they're going to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was one of the most incredible two days.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As an example, Saudi Arabia put up hundreds of billions of dollars of money going into buying our planes and our military equipment and investing in our country.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"And I said, you have to do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Otherwise I'm not going.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So they spent hundreds of billions of dollars right in front of us.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"They were signing and big people from the biggest countries in companies -- General Electric, and all of the big companies.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Many of them were there getting contracts.,0,0,1,0,0,1
All good work for our workers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was one of the things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the other thing is that -- and very important to me -- was the funding of terrorism has to stop.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And they fund terrorism -- some of those countries, many of those countries.",0,0,1,1,1,0
So we had a tremendous summit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think things are going to work out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it was a very, very important and very impressive two days.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And now, as you know, Qatar -- which a lot of people call it Qatar -- but Qatar is now a little bit on the outs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But I think they are being brought back in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because they were known as a funder of terrorism.,0,0,0,1,1,1
And we said you can't do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can't do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to starve the beast, right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And the beast is terrorism.,0,0,0,1,0,0
So we can't have wealthy countries funding that beast.,0,0,0,1,0,0
How do we handle that big military installation we built in Qatar?,0,0,0,0,0,0
What do we do with that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we'll be all right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, if we ever had to leave, we would have 10 countries willing to build us another one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Believe me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they'll pay for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The days of us paying for things are going to be largely over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They'll start paying.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We go out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We build.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you're right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Qatar -- we're going to have a good relationship with Qatar.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're not going have a problem with the military base.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if we ever needed another military base, you have other countries that would gladly build it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Believe me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You went to the G-20.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And you met for the first time, front face to face, with Vladimir Putin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And George Bush had once said he stared into his soul and came away satisfied.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What do you think?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can we trust him?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, look, we had a good meeting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we had an excellent meeting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One thing we did is we have a ceasefire in a major part of Syria where there was tremendous bedlam and tremendous killing.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"And by the way, this is now four days.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The ceasefire has held for four days.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Those cease fires haven't held at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's because President Putin and President Trump made the deal and it's held.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, I don't know what's going to happen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe as we're speaking they start shooting again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But this has held, unlike all of the other cease fires that didn't mean anything.",0,0,1,0,1,0
So that was a great thing that came out of that meeting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think a lot of things came out of that meeting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I do believe it's important to have a dialogue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you don't have a dialogue, it's a lot of problems for our country and for their country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we need dialogue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need dialogue with everybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was a great G-20.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We had 20 countries.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"I get along, I think, really fantastically with the head of every country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, you're going to France right away to meet with Macron.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you were there for Bastille Day instead of July the Fourth, that's their special holiday.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well I was invited by the president -- the new president of France -- who is a very good person, very good guy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And don't forget, I terminated for our country the Paris Accord.",0,0,1,0,1,1
So that's not that easy for them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I terminated it, because it was not fair to our country.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"We have other countries that had much better deals than we did, to put it just in a very simple form.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And I said, why do we not have a better deal?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And nobody could give me the answer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, I'm terminating.",0,0,1,0,0,0
So I terminated.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm going to be with the president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's going to be very exciting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's 100 years since World War I.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Turns out to be the exact date.,0,1,0,0,0,1
So we're going to watch something that I think will be very beautiful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's very important for our country to be represented 100 years since the First World War.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Lafayette, we are here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've come back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here we are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here we are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh that's great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well back to Putin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What do you think he wants?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know he's said what he wants.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what do you think his game is?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well he wants what's good for Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I want what's good for the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think, like in a case like Syria, where we can get together, do a cease fire -- and there are other cases or many other cases where getting along can be a very positive thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But always, Putin is going to want Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And Trump is going to want United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the way it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And sometimes, you're not going to get along on things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And sometimes you will.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we had a good meeting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was a face to face meeting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was a long meeting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was two hours and 15 minutes.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Everyone were surprised by the amount of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But that was a good thing, not a bad thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, I think we got along very well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that's a good thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's not a bad thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, of course not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"People said, oh they shouldn't get along.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Well, who are the people that are saying that?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think we got along very, very well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're a tremendously powerful nuclear power.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so are they.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure It doesn't make sense not to have some kind of a relationship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We used to have that thing called mutually assured destruction -- MAD.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And it's still there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because he can hurt us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He can decimate our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we can do the same thing to him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's something you don't even like talking about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But again, we're the most powerful country in the world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And we are getting more and more powerful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because I'm a big military person.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As an example, if Hillary had won, our military would be decimated.",0,0,0,1,0,1
Our energy would be much more expensive.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's what Putin doesn't like about me.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And that's why I say, why would he want me?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because from day one, I wanted a strong military.",0,0,0,0,1,0
He doesn't want to see that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And from day one, I want fracking and everything else to get energy prices low and to create tremendous energy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to be self-supporting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We just about are now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to be exporting energy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He doesn't want that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He would like Hillary, where she wants to have windmills.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He would much rather have that, because energy prices will go up.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And Russia, as you know, relies very much on energy.",0,0,0,0,1,1
There are many things that I do that are the exact opposite of what he would want.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when I keep hearing about that he would have rather had Trump, I think probably not.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Because when I want a strong military, you know she wouldn't have spent the money on the military.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when I want a strong military, and when I want tremendous energy, we're opening up coal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're opening up natural gas.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We're opening up fracking -- all the things that he would hate.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But nobody ever mentions it.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Well, Gazprom held Europe by the throat.",0,0,1,1,0,0
They were the monopoly.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"And now the US is breaking into that monopoly with our exports of LNG, right?",0,0,0,1,0,1
Right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have LNG exporting all over.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"We have taken off some of the regulations that would make it impossible for the energy companies, impossible for banks, impossible for a lot of different things.",0,0,0,1,1,1
You couldn't build a house in some places.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And many of those restrictions have been taken off.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Some are being taken off.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"We have statutory waits, meaning you have to wait a certain period of time.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And the country is doing really well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So the stock market is the highest it's ever been.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We have almost $4 trillion in gain.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"$4 trillion, I hope you're taking advantage of that.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We have four -- almost $4 trillion --,0,0,1,0,1,1
I'm into the bargain --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when you think of that, that's creating value.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have a lot of tremendous things ready to go, tremendous projects all over the country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Don't forget, when I came in, one of my first acts was the Keystone Pipeline.",1,0,0,0,1,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the Dakota Access Pipeline.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These two things got approved immediately.,0,0,0,0,1,0
They would have never been built.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And it's thousands and thousands of jobs.,1,0,1,0,0,1
And it was my honor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To me, it was a no-brainer.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The regulatory burden on American business has been, really, worse than taxes.",0,0,1,1,0,1
And you have lifted -- how many regulations have you lifted so far?,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Oh, just thousands.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And what we've done is we've given the farmers back their land.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We've given the home-builders the right to put up a house.,0,0,0,0,1,1
You had cases where a farm would have a little puddle someplace -- a puddle.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"When I grew up, we used to call it a puddle, right -- you too, probably.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they considered it a lake.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And if you touched it, bad, bad things happen to you and your family.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've given the farmers back their farms.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"We have so many things planned in the future too, with the tax cuts and the death taxes.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We're ending the death taxes.,0,1,0,0,1,1
There's so many things we have planned.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the farmers are so happy now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The home-builders are happy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have our most jobs ever in our country.,0,1,1,0,1,1
Now we have to take care of those people that have given up looking for a job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have a large group of people in this country that have given up.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I would talk about them a lot in speeches.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They've given up looking for jobs.,0,0,1,0,0,1
They're going to be looking very soon.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they're going to be getting those jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was talking to Mike Pence a few minutes ago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And he thinks that possibly that health care bill can go through.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are two pieces of legislation that the American people are really anxious to see put through.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One is this iniquitous Obamacare has got to go and be replaced.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Number two, we've got to have a tax cut, especially for small businesses -- corporate tax.",0,0,0,0,0,1
How far along are you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And number three is infrastructure, which we're going to do also.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Exactly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But number one, repeal and replace.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am sitting in the Oval Office with a pen in hand, waiting for our senators to give it to me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For years, they've been talking about repeal and replace, repeal and replace.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think they passed it 61 times -- repeal and replace.,0,0,0,1,1,1
But that didn't mean anything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because you had the minority, the Republicans.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"They didn't have the majority, so it wasn't going to get to the president.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"But if it ever did, Obama was going to sign it, so it didn't mean.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Now, we have a president that's waiting to sign it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have pen in hand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So now it means something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Those other times -- those many, many times that they passed it --",0,0,0,0,0,0
What's the hold up?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have very good people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These are very good people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have 52 senators.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It's very hard to get all -- we need almost all of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You need almost all of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the holdup.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And states are somewhat different.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But with all of that being said, has to get passed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They have to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They have to get together and get it done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What will happen if they don't?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I don't want to talk about it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because I think it would be very bad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would be very angry about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And a lot of people will be very upset.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm sitting waiting for that bill to come to my desk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope that they do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They've been promising it for years.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"They've been promising it ever since Obamacare, which has failed.",1,0,1,0,1,1
It's a failed experiment.,1,0,0,1,0,0
It is totally gone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's out of business.,0,0,1,0,1,0
And we have to get this done -- repeal and replace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mitch McConnell is a tactician of great skill.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You think he can pull it off?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's his job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's got to pull it off.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mitch has to pull it off.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's working very hard.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's got to pull it off.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, the next thing is taxes.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It looks like to me, lowering the corporate tax to get us in line with the rest of the world is, again, a no-brainer.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Can you get that one through?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think after health care, taxes are going to be so easy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Health care is very hard.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Health care is hard, because you'll do something a little bit this way, and you pick up that final vote, and you lose four votes over here.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Now you it back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a very tiny little road.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's about two feet wide.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it goes throughout the country.,0,0,0,0,1,0
So health care is much tougher than taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I think taxes are going to be very well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, our plan is we're talking about massive tax cuts -- the biggest tax cut in the history of our country.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We're going to get people back again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to bring back $4 trillion from overseas.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Money that can't come back into this country because of our tax code.,0,0,0,1,1,1
We're going to bring back $4 trillion -- could be more than that -- from corporations that can't get their money back into our country.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We're going to give a tremendous tax cut for the middle class.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're bringing it down to 10%.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We're bringing corporate taxes down to 15%.,0,0,0,0,1,1
I hope we can get that number approved.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe they'll want to do something and negotiate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if we get what we want, it will be the biggest tax cut and the greatest tax reform in the history of our country.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Would you settle for the tax cut without reforming the whole tax code?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Or would you like to work with the whole thing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think we can do them simultaneously.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The code is too complicated.,0,0,0,0,0,0
H&R Block won't be happy.,0,0,0,1,0,0
But people go out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They spend a lot of their money on getting other people to do their taxes.,0,0,0,0,1,1
I'm one of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You understand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's unnecessary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So simplification is very important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Reform is very important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the biggest thing to me is tax cut.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going for very large tax cuts for businesses and for the middle class.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Tremendous tax cuts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Chairman Brady is on board with what you want to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's a great guy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He will line up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Have you got anybody in the Senate of like mind?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well first of all, Chairman Brady is a great guy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He really knows the subject.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He'll never disappoint you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So they're, I think, really good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the Senate, I think we're going to do very well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, like health care -- this is simpler than health care, believe it or not -- but like health care, I think we're going to get it done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And then I want to go to infrastructure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to rebuild our country -- our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to rebuild our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Exactly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we will have, in another few months, have spent $7 trillion dollars in the Middle East.",0,0,1,1,1,1
$7 trillion.,0,1,1,0,1,1
"And then if you want to spend $2 on building a school in Iowa or in Pennsylvania or in Florida, they don't want to give you the money.",0,0,0,1,0,1
But we've spent -- in a very short period of time -- we will be up to $7 trillion dollars.,0,0,1,1,1,1
How ridiculous is this?,0,0,0,1,0,0
And here's what we got for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nothing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nothing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Middle East is a mess.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I'm there for one reason.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to get rid of the terrorists.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the reason.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're almost there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have really made headway.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've made, as I said, we've made more headway in the last short period of time than they have ever before, by far, during this long period of time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But when you think that we've spent -- we will have spent $7 trillion.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Think of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've spent, as of a few months ago, we actually have spent $6 trillion in the Middle East.",0,0,1,0,1,1
But we have nothing for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nothing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to rebuild our bridges and our roads.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a friend who's a trucker.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And he loves -- he's very proud of his equipment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He buys it very big.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And he buys the best trucks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's very proud of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said in the past, when we went from Los Angeles to New York, it was fine.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Now by the time he gets to New York, with all the problems on the roads and potholes, he said I've got to fix my equipment all the time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He wants to go to a different level of truck, meaning downward.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Where do you go --,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to fix our roads.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have to fix our infrastructure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So infrastructure is very important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Somebody suggested the Federal Reserve has a big slush fund that maybe they could pass over for infrastructure without actually having to raise taxes.,0,0,1,1,0,1
How do you get the money for that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, we'll get the money.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to get the money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're going to grow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I say it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to grow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have tremendous growth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're being held back by all these regulations, which I'm knocking out left and right.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0

President Trump knows that every day Obamacare survives is another day that American families and American businesses struggle.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"As we've traveled across the country, we've heard firsthand from Americans just like those who stand behind me today, from families who are bearing the cost of skyrocketing premiums and plummeting choices, from families who've lost their doctors, lost their insurance, and from families who are starting to lose hope that Congress will ever respond.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But as I've told every one of them and people all across this country, thanks to the leadership of President Trump, help is on the way.",0,0,0,0,1,0
President Trump hears you.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"We're suffering, because, seven years ago a small group of politicians and special interests in Washington engineered a government takeover of health care.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Every pledge that Washington Democrats made to pass that bill turned out to be a lie.,0,0,0,1,1,0
It was a big fat ugly lie.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Democrats promised Americans like Steve Finn, a former police officer in West Virginia, that they would save $2,500 a year under Obamacare.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Instead, his premiums have more than tripled.",0,1,1,0,1,1
That's pretty bad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As a result of Obamacare skyrocketing cost, Steve and his family, and many of his employees, had no other option than going on Medicaid and giving up their existing coverage.",0,0,1,0,1,1
No choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But now there's only one insurer left in the state exchange and Marjorie says that every year she waits anxious to learn if the doctors and hospitals, which our son needs the most, will remain in their network.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"More Obamacare lies, and you've seen that up front, unfortunately, up front and personal.",0,0,0,1,0,0
The Democrats promised Melissa Ackinson that her son's pre-existing conditions would be covered.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"The Ackinson quickly learned that Obamacare's promise of covering for pre-existing conditions was meaningless, though, if the doctors you need for your care aren't on your Obamacare plan.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So you just have a meaningless promise and everybody knows it, and most people on Obamacare know it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"After an excruciating series of events and complications, Melissa and her husband found themselves just before Christmas, emotionally and financially devastated crying in a doctor's office, faced with yet another seemingly unpayable bill.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"They're not going to be, and they haven't been the first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are many many cases such as that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The 401ks.,0,1,0,0,0,0

Poppy has to wear special bandages all of the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unfortunately, under Obamacare.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"Poppy's insurance has been repeatedly discontinued and replaced with what Washington deems equivalent policies, but for Poppy, these plans are not equivalent and Poppy's family has to spend precious time and tremendous resources fighting for exceptions for Poppy.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"The Washington politicians who made those promises to Steve, Marjorie, Melissa, Erin and their beautiful children want to ignore all the pain, all the suffering and all of the money, the tremendous amounts of money, that these lies have caused.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They want to forget about the countless Americans they've hurt.,0,0,0,1,0,0

"For the last seven years, Republicans have been united and standing up for Obamacare's victims, remember, repeal and replace, repeal and replace.",0,0,0,0,0,1

Every Republican running for office promised immediate relief from this disastrous law.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"We, as a party, must fulfill that solemn promise to the voters of this country, to repeal and replace what they've been saying for the last seven years.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"They now have a chance, however, to hopefully, hopefully fix what has been so badly broken for such a long time, and that is through replacement of a horrible disaster known as Obamacare.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The Senate is very close to the votes it needs to pass a replacement.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The problem is, we have zero help from the Democrats.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"They're obstructionist, that's all they are.",0,0,0,1,0,0

"They say all the right things, and then they do exactly what they're not supposed to be doing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Democrats aren't giving us one vote, so we need virtually every single vote from the Republicans.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Not easy to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Senate bill that is being considered outside of the outright repeal of Obamacare will also provide emergency relief for the law's victims, and it will deliver truly great health care and health care reforms that our citizens want, need and really should be demanding.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Some are demanding.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You'll see that at the voter booth.,0,0,0,0,0,1
believe me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here are just some of these terrific reforms that we will be doing if everything works out the way it should.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Senate bill eliminates the painful individual mandate.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"It eliminates the job-killing employer mandate, repeals other burdensome taxes, and will significantly lower Americans premiums.",0,0,1,0,1,1
It will stabilize collapsing health insurance markets and give Americans far more choice and far more flexibility.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"The Senate bill protects coverage for pre-existing conditions, and you don't hear this from the Democrats.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"They like to tell you just the opposite, and they didn't even know the bill.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"They run out, they say: death, death, death.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, Obamacare is death, that's the one that's death.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, besides that, it's failing, so you won't have it anyway.",0,0,0,1,1,0
It dramatically expands popular health savings accounts,0,0,1,0,1,0
"It provides tax credits, so Americans can purchase a private plan that is right for them and their families.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"It devotes substantial resources to fight the opioid, and this is a tremendous problem, the opioid epidemic.",0,0,0,1,1,1
"$45 billion is being put in, so that the people of many states like New Hampshire, Ohio and so many others that have such a big problem, can be helped and helped greatly.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Gonna be fighting the drug problems very, very seriously, in my administration.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it provides among many other things, higher quality care and more flexibility for states to administer Medicaid to better serve their poorest citizens.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on whether to allow this urgently needed bill to come to the Senate floor for debate.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The question for every senator, Democrat or Republican, is whether they will side with Obamacare's architects which have been so destructive to our country, or with it's forgotten victims.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Any senator who votes against starting debate, is telling America that you are fine with the Obamacare nightmare, which is what it is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For Democrats, this vote is a chance to make up for the terrible harm they have inflicted on Americans, like those who are with us today, Obamacare has been for them a nightmare.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Over and over again, they said, repeal and replace, repeal and replace.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they can now keep their promise to the American people to provide emergency relief to those in desperate need of help and to improve health care for all Americans.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"To every member of the Senate, I say this: the American people have waited long enough.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There's been enough talk and no action.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now is the time for action.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are here to solve problems for the people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Obamacare has broken our health care system.,1,0,1,1,0,1
It's broken.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's collapsing.,0,0,0,0,1,0
It's gone.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"We've added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a million private sector jobs.",0,1,1,0,1,1

"One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American people during my campaign for president, whether it's cutting job- killing regulations, appointing and confirming a tremendous Supreme Court justice, putting in place tough new ethics rules, achieving a record reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border, or bringing jobs, plants and factories back into the United States at numbers which no one, until this point, thought even possible.",0,0,1,0,1,1

"Thank you -- but begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris accord or an -- really entirely new transaction, on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So we're getting out, but we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if we can, that's great.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if we can't, that's fine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As president, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of American citizens.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States, to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers, who I love, and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories and vastly diminished economic production.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"This includes ending the implementation of the nationally-determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund, which is costing the United States a vast fortune.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025, according to the National Economic Research Associates.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs -- not what we need.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"Believe me, this is not what we need -- including automobile jobs and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely -- they rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"According to the same study, by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration would cut production for the following sectors: paper, down 12 percent; cement, down 23 percent; iron and steel, down 38 percent; coal, and I happen to love the coal miners, down 86 percent; natural gas, down 31 percent.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have 7,000 less income, and in many cases, much worse than that.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscious support a deal that punishes the United States, which is what it does.",0,1,0,1,0,0
"The world's leader in environmental protection, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world's leading polluters.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For example, under the agreement, China will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years, 13.",1,1,1,0,1,1
They can do whatever they want for 13 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.,0,0,1,0,1,1
There are many other examples.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair at the highest level to the United States.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"Further, while the current agreement effectively blocks the development of clean coal in America, which it does.",0,1,0,1,1,1
"And the mines are starting to open up, having a big opening in two weeks, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, so many places.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"A big opening of a brand, new mine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's unheard of.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For many, many years that hasn't happened.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They asked me if I'd go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to try.,0,0,0,0,0,0
China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"So, we can't build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.",0,1,1,0,1,1
India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Think of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
India can double their coal production.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We're supposed to get rid of ours.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Even Europe is allowed to continue construction of coal plants.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"It just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.",0,0,1,1,1,1
This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The rest of the world applauded when we signed the Paris Agreement.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They went wild.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They were so happy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage.",0,0,1,1,0,1
A cynic would say the obvious reason for economic competitors and their wish to see us remain in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.,0,0,0,1,0,1
We would find it very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have among the most abundant energy reserves in the planet, sufficient to lift millions of America's poorest workers out of poverty.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Yet under this agreement, we are effectively putting these reserves under lock and key, taking away the great wealth of our nation, great wealth, phenomenal wealth.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Not so long ago we had no idea we had such wealth.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And leaving millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.,0,0,1,0,1,1
The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"At 1 percent growth, renewable sources of energy can meet some of our domestic demand. But at 3 or 4 percent growth, which I expect, we need all forms of available American energy, or our country...",0,0,0,0,1,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
... will be at grave risk of brownouts and blackouts.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Our businesses will come to a halt in many cases.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations it is estimated it would only produce a two tenths of one degree - think of that, this much - Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100.",0,1,1,0,1,1
Tiny - tiny amount.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"In fact, 14 days of carbon emissions from China alone would wipe out the gains from America and this is an incredible statistic - would totally wipe out the gains from America's expected reductions in the year 2030.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"After we have had to spend billions and billions of dollars, lost jobs, closed factories and suffered much higher energy costs for our businesses and for our homes.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"As ""The Wall Street Journal"" wrote, this morning, ""The reality is that withdrawing is in America's economic interest and won't matter much to the climate.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The United States under the Trump Administration will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on earth.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
We'll be the cleanest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have the cleanest air.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have the cleanest water.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We will be environmentally friendly but we're not going to put our businesses out of work, we're not going to lose our jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to grow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to grow rapidly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think you just read - it just came out minutes ago the small business report.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Small businesses as of just now are booming, hiring people, one of the best reports they've seen in many years.",0,0,1,0,1,1
I'm willing to immediately work with Democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers or to negotiate a new deal that protects our country and its tax payers.,0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let's make them non-obstructionists.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We will all sit down and we will get back into the deal and we'll make it good and we won't be closing up our factories and we won't be losing our jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we'll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that's much better than the Paris Accord and I think the people of sour country will be thrilled.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But until we do that we're out of the agreement.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I will work to ensure that America remains the world's leader on environmental issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
No responsible leader can put the workers and the people of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States while empowering some of the world's top polluting countries should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wished to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement.,0,0,0,1,1,1
It's to give their country an economic edge over the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's not going to happen while I'm president, I'm sorry.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"My job as president is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive country on earth.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And with the highest standard of living, and the highest standard of environmental protection.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our tax bill is moving along in Congress and I believe it's doing very well.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I think a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Republicans are working very, very hard.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We'd love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone, but it's going very well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Paris agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country's expense.,0,0,0,0,1,1
They don't put America first.,0,0,0,1,0,0
I do and I always will.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and in many cases lax contributions to our critical military alliance.,0,0,1,1,1,1
You see what's happening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
At what point does America get demeaned?,0,0,0,0,0,0
At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We want fair treatment for its citizens and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they won't be.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They won't be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but they'll soon be under renegotiation.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"The process has begun from day one, but now we're down to business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called ""green climate fund"" -- nice name -- which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries all on top of America's existing and massive foreign aid payments.",0,0,1,1,1,1
So we're going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars and we're already way ahead of anybody else.,0,0,0,1,1,1
Many of the other countries haven't spent anything.,0,0,1,0,1,1
And many of them will never pay one dime.,0,0,1,0,1,0
The green fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Nobody else is even close.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Most of them haven't even paid anything -- including funds raided out of America's budget for the war against terrorism.,0,0,1,1,1,1
That's where they came.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Believe me, they didn't come from me.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They came just before I came into office.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Not good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And not good the way they took the money.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And not good the way they took the money.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"In 2015, the united nations' departing top climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as peanuts and stated that the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"In 2015, the green climate fund's executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year after 2020, and nobody even knows where the money's going to.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"Nobody's been able to say, where is it going to?",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Of course, the world's top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the green fund, which we terminated.",0,0,1,1,1,1
America is $20 trillion in debt-cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Or fix vital infrastructure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Millions of our citizens are out of work, and yet under the Paris accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.",0,0,1,0,1,1
So think of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world, should not have more to say with respect to the U.S. Economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives, thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of America's sovereignty.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
Our constitution is unique among all nations of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States as we begin the process of unlocking the restrictions on America's abundant energy reserves.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Which we have started.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Very strongly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the new reality we face if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not negotiate a far better deal.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"The risks grow as historically, these agreements only tend to become more and more ambitious over time.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"In other words, the Paris framework is just a starting point.",0,0,0,0,0,0
As bad as it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not an end point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And exiting the agreement protects the United States from future intrusions on the United States' sovereignty.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And massive future legal liability.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Believe me, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"As president, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Paris accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risk, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.",0,0,1,1,0,1
It is time to exit the Paris accord.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, along with many, many other locations within our great country, before Paris, France.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It is time to make America great again.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I'd like to ask Scott Pruitt, who most of you know and respect, as I do, just to say a few words.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Scott, please?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you Mr. President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Your decision today to exit the Paris accord reflects your unflinching commitment to put America first.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And by exiting you're fulfilling yet one more campaign promise to the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Please know that I'm thankful for your fortitude, your courage and your steadfastness as you serve and lead our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"America finally has a leader who answers only to the people, not the special interests who had their way for way too long.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"You're a cham... you're a champion for the hard working citizens, all across this land, who just want a government that listens to them and represents their interests.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have promised put America first in all that you do, and you've done that in any number of ways, from trade, to national security, to protecting our border, to right-sizing Washington DC.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"And today, you put America first, with regard to international agreements and n the environment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is an historic restoration of American economic independence, one that will benefit the working class, the working poor and working people of all stripes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"With this action, we have declared that the people are rulers of this country once again.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It should be noted that we as a nation to a better than anyone in the world, in striking the balance between growing our economy, growing jobs while also being a good steward of our environment.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We owe no apologies to other nations for our environmental stewardship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"After all, before the Paris accord was ever signed, America reduced its CO2 footprint to levels from the early 1990s.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"In factm between the years 2000 and 2014, the United States reduced its carbon emissions by 18+ percent.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"And this was corrected accomplished, not through government mandate, but accomplished through innovation and technology of American private sector.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"For that reason Mr. President, you have corrected a view that was paramount in Paris that somehow the United States should penalize its own economy, be apologetic, lead with our chin, while the rest of the world does little.",0,0,0,1,0,0
Other nations talk a good game.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We lead with action.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our efforts, Mr. President, as you know, should be on exporting our technology, our innovation, to nations who seek to reduce their CO2 footprint, to learn from us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That should be our focus, versus agreed to unachievable targets that harm our economy and the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, it takes courage, it takes commitment, to say no to the plaudits of men while doing what's right by American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have that courage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the American people can take comfort, because you have their backs.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I've already authorized the construction of the long-stalled and delayed Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines.,0,0,0,0,1,1

But the border by itself right now is doing very well.,0,0,0,0,1,0
It's becoming very strong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
General Kelly has done a great job -- General Kelly.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Following my executive action -- and don't forget, we've only been here for like -- what?",0,0,0,0,0,0
-- 50 days -- we've already experienced an unprecedented 40-percent reduction in illegal immigration on our Southern border; 61 percent since Inauguration Day -- 61 percent.,1,0,1,0,1,1
Think about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And now people are saying, we're not going to go there anymore because we can't get in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So it's going to get better and better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We got to stop those drugs, though.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We got to stop those drugs.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"During the campaign, as I traveled all across this country, I met with many American families whose loved ones were viciously and violently killed by illegal immigrants because our government refused to enforce our already existing laws.",0,0,0,1,1,1
These American victims were ignored by the media.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They were ignored by Washington.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"But they were not ignored by me, and they're not ignored by you, and they never will be ignored certainly any longer.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Not going to happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"As we speak, we are finding the drug dealers, the robbers, thieves, gang members, killers and criminals preying on our citizens.",0,0,1,1,0,1
"One by one -- you're reading about it, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
They're being thrown out of our country.,0,0,0,1,0,0
They're being thrown into prisons.,0,0,1,1,1,1
And we will not let them back in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're also working, night and day, to keep our nation safe from terrorism.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
We have seen the devastation from 9/11 to Boston to San Bernardino -- hundreds upon hundreds of people from outside our country have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses in the United States courts.,0,1,1,1,1,1
Right now we have investigations going on all over -- hundreds of refugees are under federal investigation for terrorism and related reasons.,0,1,1,1,1,1
We have entire regions of the world destabilized by terrorism and ISIS.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"For this reason, I issued an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration from places where it cannot safely occur.",0,0,0,0,1,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me give you the bad news.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We don't like bad news, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to hear -- and I'll turn it into good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But let me give you the bad, the sad news.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Moments ago, I learned that a district judge in Hawaii -- part of the much overturned 9th Circuit Court -- and I have to be nice; otherwise I'll get criticized for speaking poorly about our courts.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"I'll be criticized by these people, among the most dishonest people in the world -- I will be criticized -- I'll be criticized by them for speaking harshly about our courts.",0,0,0,1,0,0
I would never want to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A judge has just blocked our executive order on travel and refugees coming into our country from certain countries.,0,0,1,1,1,1
Booo --,0,0,0,0,0,0
The order he blocked was a watered-version of the first order that was also blocked by another judge and should have never been blocked to start with.,0,0,1,1,1,1
This new order was tailored to the dictates of the 9th Circuit's -- in my opinion -- flawed ruling.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"This is, the opinion of many, an unprecedented judicial overreach.",0,0,0,1,0,0
The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems -- or she -- or she.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Fortunately, it will not be Hillary she.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
When he or she deems it to be in the national interest of our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we have a lot of lawyers here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We also have a lot of smart people here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me read to you directly from the federal statute, 212F, of the immigration -- and you know what I'm talking about, right?",0,0,0,0,0,1
Can I read this to you?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Listen to this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, we're all smart people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're all good students -- some are bad students, but even if you're a bad student this is a real easy one, let me tell you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ready?,0,0,0,0,0,0
So here's the statute -- which they don't even want to quote when they overrule it.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And it was put here for the security of our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And this goes beyond me, because there will be other Presidents, and we need this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And sometimes we need it very badly for security -- security of our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It says -- now, listen how easy this is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may, by proclamation, and for such period as he -- see, it wasn't politically correct, because it should say he or she.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"You know, today they'd say that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Actually, that's the only mistake they made.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"as he shall deem necessary, suspending entry of all aliens, or any class of aliens, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or pose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deems to be appropriate.""",0,0,0,1,1,1
"In other words, if he thinks there's danger out there, he or she -- whoever is President -- can say, I'm sorry, folks, not now, please.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got enough problems.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're talking about the safety of our nation, the safety and security of our people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I know you people aren't skeptical people because nobody would be that way in Tennessee.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody -- not Tennessee.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You don't think this was done by a judge for political reasons, do you?",0,0,0,1,0,1
No.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Booo --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This ruling makes us look weak -- which, by the way, we no longer are, believe me.",0,0,0,1,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
Just look at our borders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to fight this terrible ruling.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to take our case as far as it needs to go, including all the way up to the Supreme Court.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to win.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to keep our citizens safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And regardless, we're going to keep our citizens safe, believe me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Even liberal Democratic lawyer, Alan Dershowitz ---- good lawyer -- just said that we would win this case before the Supreme Court of the United States.",0,0,0,0,1,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Remember this, I wasn't thrilled, but the lawyers all said, let's tailor it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a watered--down version of the first one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a watered--down version.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And let me tell you something, I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"The danger is clear, the law is clear, the need for my executive order is clear.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was elected to change our broken and dangerous system and thinking in government that has weakened and endangered our country and left our people defenseless.,0,0,0,1,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will not stop fighting for the safety of you and your families, believe me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not today, not ever.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to win it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to win it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to apply common sense.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to apply intelligence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're never quitting, and we're never going away, and we're never, ever giving up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The best way to keep foreign terrorists -- or, as some people would say in certain instances, radical Islamic terrorists -- from attacking our country is to stop them from entering our country in the first place.",0,0,0,1,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"We'll take it, but these are the problems we have.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"People are screaming, break up the 9th Circuit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'll tell you what, that 9th Circuit -- you have to see.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look at how many times they have been overturned with their terrible decisions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take a look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And this is what we have to live with.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Finally, I want to get to taxes. I want to cut the hell out of taxes, but --",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- but before I can do that -- I would have loved to have put it first, I'll be honest -- there is one more very important thing that we have to do, and we are going to repeal and replace horrible, disastrous Obamacare.",0,0,0,1,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we leave Obamacare in place, millions and millions of people will be forced off their plans, and your senators just told me that in your state you're down to practically no insurers.",0,0,1,1,0,1
You're going to have nobody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're going to have nobody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And this is true all over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The insurers are fleeing.,0,0,1,1,0,1
The insurers are fleeing.,0,0,1,1,0,1
"It's a catastrophic situation, and there's nothing to compare anything to because Obamacare won't be around for a year or two.",0,0,0,1,0,1
It's gone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So it's not like, oh, gee, they have this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Obamacare is gone.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Premiums will continue to soar double digits and even triple digits in many cases.,1,0,1,0,1,1
It will drain our budget and destroy our jobs.,0,0,1,1,0,0
Remember all of the broken promises?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Remember the wise guy -- remember the wise guy that essentially said the American people -- the so--called architect -- the American people are stupid because they approved it?,0,0,0,1,0,0
We're going to show them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Those in Congress who made these promises have no credibility whatsoever on healthcare.,0,0,0,1,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And remember this -- remember this: If we took, because there's such divisiveness -- and I'm not just talking now, with me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There was with Obama.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There was with Bush.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The level of hatred and divisiveness with the politicians.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I remember years ago, I'd go to Washington -- I* was always very politically active -- and Republicans and Democrats, they'd fight during the day and they go to dinner at night.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Today, there's a level that nobody has seen before.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just remember this: If we submitted the Democrats' plan, drawn everything perfect for the Democrats, we wouldn't get one vote from the Democrats.",0,0,0,1,1,0
That's the way it is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's how much divisiveness and other things there are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So it's a problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we're going to get it by.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I've met with so many victims of Obamacare ---- the people who have been so horribly hurt by this horrible legislation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
At the very core of Obamacare was a fatal flaw -- the government forcing people to buy a government--approved product.,0,0,1,1,1,1
There are very few people -- very few people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Booo --,0,0,0,0,0,0
By the way -- watch what happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now you just booed Obamacare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They will say, Trump got booed when he mentioned -- they're bad people, folks.",0,0,1,1,0,0
They're bad people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Booo --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Tonight, I'll go home, I'll turn on, I'll say -- listen, I'll turn on that television.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"My wife will say, darling, it's too bad you got booed.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"I said, I didn't get booed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This was a -- I said, no, no, they were booing Obamacare.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"Watch, a couple of them will actually do it, almost guaranteed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when we call them out, it makes it harder for them to do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So we'll see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's the fake, fake media.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"We want Americans to be able to purchase the health insurance plans they want, not the plans forced on them by our government.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"The House has put forward a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare based on the principles I outlined in my joint address, but let me tell you, we're going to arbitrate, we're going to all get together and we're going to get something done.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Remember this -- if we didn't do it the way we're doing it, we need 60 votes so we have to get the Democrats involved.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They won't vote, no matter what we do, they're not going to vote.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"So we're doing it a different way, a complex way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's fine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The end result is when you have phase one, phase two, phase three -- it's going to be great.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to be great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then, we get on to tax reductions, which I like.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
The House legislation does so much for you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It gives the states Medicaid flexibility.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And some of the states will take over their healthcare.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Governor Rick Scott in Florida said, just send me the money -- they run a great plan.",0,0,1,0,0,1
We have states that are doing great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It gives great flexibility.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
It repeals hundreds of billions of dollars in Obamacare taxes.,0,0,1,1,1,1
It provides tax credits to purchase the care that is rightfully theirs.,0,0,0,0,1,1
The bill that I will ultimately sign -- and that will be a bill where everybody is going to get into the room and we're going to get it done -- we'll get rid of Obamacare and make healthcare better for you and for your family.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And once this is done, and a step further, we are going to try and put it in phase three -- I'm going to work on bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"We welcome this healthcare debate and its negotiation, and we're going to carry it out, and have been carrying it out, in the full light of day -- unlike the way Obamacare was passed.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Remember, folks, if we don't do anything, Obamacare is gone.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"It's not like, oh, gee, it's going to be wonderful in three years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's gone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's gone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's gone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not working.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's gone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What we cannot do is to be intimidated by the dishonest attacks from Democratic leaders in Congress who broke the system in the first place and who don't believe you should be able to make your own healthcare decisions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am very confident that if we empower the American people we will accomplish incredible things for our country -- not just on healthcare, but all across our government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We will unlock new frontiers in science and in medicine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We will give our children the right to attend the school of their choice, one where they will be taught to love this country and its values.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"We will create millions and millions of new jobs by lowering taxes on our businesses, and very importantly for our workers, we're going to lower taxes.",0,0,0,0,0,1
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we will fight for the right of every American child to grow up in a safe neighborhood, attend a great school, and to graduate with access to a high-paying job that they love doing.",0,0,0,0,0,0

It's time to embrace our glorious American destiny.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Anything we can dream for our country we can achieve for our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All we have to do is tap into that American pride that is swelling our hearts and stirring our souls.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we found that out very recently in our last election -- a lot of pride.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are all Americans, and the future truly belongs to us.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The future belongs to all of you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is your moment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is your time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the hour when history is made.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"All we have to do is put our own citizens first, and together we will make America strong again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
We will make America wealthy again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We will make America proud again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We will make America safe again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we will make America great again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
God bless you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"God bless you, everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Applause],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Mike.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Good morning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hello, Ivanka.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know you know a few of the people in this room.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All the killers from New York -- I'm looking at all those competitive -- those great, great talents, great builders.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have to give you a heads-up that Ivanka chaired one of the sessions before this -- tough act to follow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, she's tough.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Very tough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Vice President Pence listed some of the amazing accomplishments that have taken place since your election and your 75 days in office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The stock market has had almost unprecedented sustained growth, unprecedented confidence from our manufacturing sector and other business sectors, leading to massive private sector investment in job growth.",0,1,0,0,1,1
You have gotten rid of regulations that were unnecessary and were job-stifling.,0,0,0,0,1,0
You have strengthened our borders and strengthened our military.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"You've nominated a great -- superb Supreme Court justice, amongst many other things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How does all that feel?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're getting unbelievable credit for what we've done, other than the mainstream media, which just gives us no credit whatsoever.",0,0,1,1,0,0
But we are getting tremendous credit.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"And if you look at the real estate industry, the mining industry, the farming industry -- if you look at any of the major industries you see what's going.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"In fact, even today I was very happy as I read this morning early that our trade deficit with others has gone down very considerably in the last short period of time.",0,0,0,0,1,1
It's having a big impact.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, as you know, I'm meeting with the President of China on Thursday and Friday in Palm Beach, Florida, and I think we're going to have a very interesting talk.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We're having -- have a lot of respect for him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've spoken to him numerous times.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we have to do better, because our deficit with China, as you know, $504 billion.",0,0,1,1,1,1
That's a year.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's enough for a lifetime.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Even Steve would say that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But that's a year.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we're going to have a great meeting, I'm sure we're going to have a fantastic meeting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're going to talk about a lot of things, including, of course, North Korea, a problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's really a humanity problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we're going to be talking about that also.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have made it a driving force in this administration to bring in the best minds we can from the private sector, to listen intently to them and to take decisive action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"How important is that, and how important is it to reform government to bridge the gap between the private and public sectors?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I did, I brought you, I brought Gary Cohn, I brought a lot of very great people -- my friend, Steve, is helping us out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a superstar committee of 22 people.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And every time somebody calls me I say, Steve, put them on -- no, we want to keep it at this level.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The heads of the biggest companies, they all want to be on our committee, right, Stephen?",0,0,0,0,0,0
But Steve likes to keep it very small.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But they will go off and they'll disappear and we'll put others on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we've had some great meetings and we've all learned a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One thing that did come up, and it came up yesterday, was Gary Cohn -- where's Gary?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Is he here?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Could you bring that chart, please?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you mind?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me see that chart.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So this was just something -- this is sort of incredible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's so beautiful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, no, you're not quite -- this is to build a highway in the United States -- now, this was just done yesterday.",0,0,0,1,0,1
I saw it for the first time.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"I said, I'm speaking to some of my friends who are builders, really great builders, and they've gone through the process -- we've all gone through it in New York -- we call it the zoning process in New York.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But you start up here and this is anywhere from a 10 to 20-year process.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You have -- is it 17 agencies.,0,0,0,0,1,0
You have hundreds and hundreds of permits.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Many of them are statutory, where you can't even apply for the second permit until six months go by.",0,0,1,0,1,1
So this is to build a highway.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a simple highway.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And these are the agencies -- so it's 17 agencies.,0,0,0,0,1,1
How many different steps is it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sixteen different approvals.,0,1,0,0,1,0
Sixteen.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Twenty-nine different statutes.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Five different executive orders that all apply to this process.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is indicative, so this is not a specific project, but this is the type of process that a government -- this is a state government -- would have to go through to permit a highway federally.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"This is just federal, not state regulations.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So it can take anywhere from 10 -- if you're really good, 10 years to 20 years.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And then they vote, and you lose.",0,0,0,1,0,0
They don't want it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Laughter],0,0,0,0,0,0
And it costs sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars just to go through the process.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Thank you very much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was a great job you did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Be careful, don't fall.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to have you fall.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You'll be a big story in the paper if you go down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Laughter],0,0,0,0,0,0
So I just saw that yesterday.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gary Cohn walked in and he showed it to me, and -- for no reason.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said, you have to do me a favor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But a lot of you, you're such pros, some of the best pros in the world sitting in this room, you understand it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a process.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I've always liked it because it gave people that could go through that process an advantage, like Jerry, but it gave us an advantage if you could get through the process.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But getting a building approved in New York is a horrible, horrible thing.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And that's nothing compared to when you get into the highways and the dams -- they don't even talk about dams anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Hydropower is a great, great, form of power -- we don't even talk about it, because to get the environmental permits are virtually impossible.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's one of the best things you can do -- hydro.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we don't talk about it anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we've come to a halt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have a tremendous person that we put in charge of EPA, Scott Pruitt, who is an environmental person.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"He wants clean air, he wants clean water, but he doesn't thing it takes you 26 years to get a permit to build a building and to have jobs, at which time those companies are usually gone, out of business, et cetera.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So we're really speeding up the process.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We're going to try and take that process from a minimum of 10 years down to one year.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I said can't we make it four months?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can't we do it in four months?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And there is a certain logic to that, but we'll be satisfied with the year -- but it won't be any more than a year.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So we have to build roads.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to build highways.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're talking about a very major infrastructure bill of a trillion dollars -- perhaps even more.,0,0,1,1,1,1
"And when we have to do -- our jobs -- I mean, if we say, we're giving to New York City hundreds of millions of dollars to build a road someplace, it doesn't help if they can't start because it's going to take seven and a half years to get the permits.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Even to redo a road takes years to get the permits.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, you have a road that's there and you want to redo it, and you have to get new permits for the kind of asphalt you're using, the kind of concrete you may want to use.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And if we're going to give all of this money -- you know, there was very large infrastructure bill that was approved during the Obama administration -- a trillion dollars -- nobody ever saw anything being built.",1,0,1,1,1,1
"I mean, to this day, I haven't heard of anything that's been built.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They used most of that money -- it went, and they used it on social programs.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And we want this to be on infrastructure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm working with Steve Roth and with Richard LeFrak -- two friends of mine that are very good builders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're great builders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they know to get things done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They know how to cut red tape.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We're going to give them the advantage of having what we have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I see Elaine is here, so important, who is doing an incredible job, by the way -- Secretary of Transportation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And Elaine will be working.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we're going to set up a committee headed by Steve and Richard, and we're going to cut a lot of red tape.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we don't want to send a billion dollars to New York and find out, five years later, the money was never spent, because we're going to be very strong that it has to be spent on shovels, not on other programs.",0,0,1,1,1,1
"And in the last case, a lot of it was spent on other programs.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"But we're going to say, if you don't spend the money -- if you don't start -- if you have a job that you can't start within 90 days, we're not going to give you the money for it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Because it doesn't help -- doesn't help us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're going to be very strong on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They have to be able to start within 90 days.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Mr. President, we have some of the great business leaders in the country here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If okay with you, they have a few questions, if that's --",0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hello, Jerry.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Laughter],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hi, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Laughter],0,0,0,0,0,0
He didn't have to say his name.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He was ready to say his name -- we know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jerry Speyer, everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, you're doing a great job, and we're all really grateful to you for the sacrifices you're making.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Hope you heard that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That sounds much better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think from New York's point of view we send a lot of money into the economy.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"As a number of people have said, it's over a trillion dollars.",0,0,1,1,1,1
We're worried we're going to have a problem with Congress.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"With the deductions, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we're worried about various programs that help the city.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The city is doing fine right now -- even the Yankees are doing fine.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But what we're really concerned about is the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you have any advice for us?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I love New York.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in some ways we're all lucky that I'm from New York,, because New York has unique problems.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So does Los Angeles, so does Chicago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are places that have unique problems.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One of the problems that you have is debt and deductibility.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"That's a big one, because a lot of the states that don't have debt or have very little debt -- like in the case of Mike Pence, where he did such a good job in Indiana, and it's a AAA-rated bond, one of the strongest in the country, and deductibility is not that big of a deal because they don't have that much to deduct.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And over here, in New York, when you look at what's going on with us, we don't know in terms of the municipality and in terms of the state, we don't know if it can even make it if you don't have that.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Are people going to buy?,0,0,0,0,0,0
So it's a very big problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the problem I have is that there are many places throughout the country that are in the exact opposite position.,0,0,0,1,0,1
And they consider that a gift to the state and a gift to the people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we know New York does things that a lot of people don't read about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You look at what -- the money they contribute to our economy, to our country, and people don't know about that.",0,1,1,1,0,1
They don't maybe want to know about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So you do have -- I call it a tale of two cities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have different interests.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I am watching over everybody, Jerry.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're in good hands, okay?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're in good hands, believe me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You can tell the people of New York.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Even though I didn't win New York State.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I should have won New York State, but I didn't.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"[Applause, Laughter]",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, Cathy Engelbert with Deloitte.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to return to a conversation we just had with Ivanka, Dina and Wilbur on jobs, the workforce of the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so as we think about that and we think about our skillsets, in New York City alone our high school -- public high school graduation rate is at 70 percent, but the readiness of our students for college and careers is only 37 -- it's assessed at 37 percent.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So as we look at the pace of change, we look at the digital transformation we all see in business and the marketplace, and we look at the skills that -- this disconnect between what employers need and what our students coming into our workforces are prepared to deliver.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It would be great to get your thoughts on the priorities of the administration around education, around, again, what I like to call not the future of work but the work of the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because the future of work sounds a little ominous, but the work of the future actually sounds pretty visionary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So if you could give us those priorities --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Okay, so before you sit, so you're giving me numbers from New York.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're a proud New Yorker, but you're giving me numbers -- why is it doing so badly?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Tell me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why are the numbers so horrific in terms of education?,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what happens when somebody goes through school and then they can't read after -- they graduate from high school and they can barely read.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So what's the answer?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, first, I would say that as we look at New York, New York has made enormous progress in a decade.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"By the way, that 70 percent was 50 percent, so a 40 percent increase.",0,1,1,0,1,1
So we're making enormous progress in making an impact on --,0,0,0,0,0,0
See how quickly she's changing?,0,0,0,0,0,0
See that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
[Laughter],0,0,0,0,0,0
"Making enormous progress, but we're not done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a lot of work to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think -- we talked earlier about public/private partnerships, apprenticeship models, which -- we have a beautiful apprenticeship model that works and brings them our next generation of leaders.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So I do think there's a lot we can do through relooking at funding programs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We talked earlier about consolidating the many programs that are out there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're all trying to make our individual impact and we can make a huge impact together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know you work very hard on it and you have made progress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Charter schools are another thing that people are talking about a lot, and some of the charter schools in New York have been amazing.",0,0,0,0,1,1
They've done incredibly well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People can't get in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, you can't get in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't call it an experiment anymore, it's far beyond an experiment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you look at so many elements of education, and it's so sad to see what's coming -- what's happening in the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Even the numbers, as good -- you say we're doing better, but the numbers in New York, the numbers in Chicago are very rough.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"The numbers in Los Angeles, the cities, it's a very rough situation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Common Core -- I mean, we have to bring education more local.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We can't be managing education from Washington.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I go out to Iowa, when I go out to the different states and I talk, they want to run their school programs locally, and they'll do a much better job than somebody -- and look, these are some very good people in Washington, but you also have bureaucrats that make a lot of money and don't really care that much about what they're doing or about the community that they have never seen and they'll never meet, and they never will see.",0,0,0,1,0,1
And I like the fact of getting rid of -- Common Core to me is -- we have to end it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to bring education local.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To me, I've always said it, I've been saying it during the campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're doing it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Betsy DeVos is -- she's doing a terrific job, highly respected, tremendous track record.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But she's got one of the toughest jobs of any of our secretaries, to me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She's got one of the toughest jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There's some pretty tough jobs out there, but she's got one of the toughest jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to spend a lot of money and a lot of expertise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to have great talent having to do with education, because there's nothing more important than education.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we've got to get those numbers in New York better, and I think they will be better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And a lot of people -- a lot of the greatest people I know in New York, they're totally involved, including Ivanka and Jared, they're so much involved, and it's so important to them, the word ""education.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it's happening, and I see it happening in New York very much.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"But it's happening elsewhere, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we're going to have a great four years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, I know you have --",0,0,0,0,0,0
Prior to running again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
-- a pressing issue to deal with.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Steve and Mike I think just wanted to thank you for attending today, and maybe make a final comment on behalf of --",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, thanks a lot for being here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And thanks for everybody for being here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's been a really interesting day, and you've had everybody of importance at the event.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it's terrific in terms of the stuff you're trying to do to modernize the government, educate, and so forth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think we have to keep a focus on that, because the outside world doesn't always get the message that that's really what's going on -- because you're doing profound things, taking on enormous embedded issues.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think with the kind of effort that can be marshaled, you can do amazing things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's on behalf of Mike Corbat and myself who chaired the Partnership -- it's sort of trust, and gets rotated from person to person every two years.",0,0,0,0,1,1
I want to wish you really good luck with the Chinese.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's an important thing, as we all know.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think there's a real opportunity to make progress with them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you should have a good time in Florida.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope the weather is good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, the weather will be beautiful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Steve.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I just want to finish by saying that we are absolutely destroying these horrible regulations that have been placed on your heads over not eight years, over the last 20 and 25 years.",0,0,0,1,1,0
You have regulations that are horrendous.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"Dodd-Frank is an example of what we're working on, and we're working on it right now.",0,0,0,0,1,0
We're going to be coming out with some very strong -- far beyond recommendations -- we're going to be doing things that are going to be very good for the banking industry so that the banks can loan money to people that need it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I speak to people all the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They used to borrow money from banks to open up -- there's one in Nevada -- to open up a pizza shop here, three shops -- he had a bank, and he said, you know -- at that time he called me ""Mr. Trump"" because I hadn't won yet -- but he said, ""Mr. Trump, I can't open up anything; I can't do anything.",0,0,1,1,0,1
The banks don't even -- I had a bank for 20 years; now they don't even take my phone call.,0,0,1,1,1,1
And I was always a very good customer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I haven't been able to do what I do.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
They can't do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, the banks got so restricted.",0,0,0,1,0,1
