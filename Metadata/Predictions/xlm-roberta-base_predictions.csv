I think we've seen a deterioration of values.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that's all wrong.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"So we've seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we've got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to get after the users more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to change this whole culture.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But we have got to instill values in these young people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.,1,0,1,0,0,0

And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you.",0,0,1,0,0,0

But we also have to take demand seriously.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.,1,0,0,0,0,1
We're helping youngsters; we're reaching out to them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I asked for and received the same briefing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what I'm about to say is unclassified.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.,1,0,1,0,0,0
It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him.",1,1,1,1,1,1
And so I think it's about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Panama is a friendly country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And we want to bring him to justice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, I've been very specific about those, John.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I've outlined those in detail.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, finally, we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid to this country.",1,0,1,0,0,1
It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected.,0,0,1,0,0,1
I've also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break.",1,0,1,0,1,1
He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will say this -,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If he's serious about what he's saying, then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social Security Trust Fund, and he tried that in 1985, and I think he's going to try it again.",1,0,1,0,0,0
Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are so many things there, I don't quite know where to begin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you cut capital gains, you put people to work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut.",1,0,1,0,0,1
It's not going to cost the government money.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"It's going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it's going to create jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times.",1,0,1,0,1,1
That happens to be a fact.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"And so let's kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes.",0,1,0,0,0,1
I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto.",1,0,0,0,0,0
He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I would like a balanced budget amendment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.,1,1,0,0,0,1
So the problem is - it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little.,0,1,1,0,0,1
It is that we are continuing to spend too much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Spending was only up something like 4 percent.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"So, it isn't that we're taking too little - from taxpayer - we're spending too much still.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And they agree, that if we can do what I've said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Capital gains, one more point on that, please let's learn from history.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Why that's more than the average teacher makes.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"We've had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I want to keep this economic recovery going.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force.",1,0,0,0,0,1
What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that's the answer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we're talking about here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ""We can't make it.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All these programs - and this cost on his - is - was - I saw an estimate, I'd love to know what he thinks, $35 - $40 billion - and it seems to me that somebody pays that.",0,1,1,1,1,1
There isn't any such thing as something free out there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, George, that's no answer.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You don't like the answer, but it's an answer.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night.",1,0,0,0,0,1
All of them with little or no health insurance.,0,0,0,0,1,0
One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Has an 11 year old son and can't let that son compete in sports and Little League, because he's afraid he's going to get hurt and he won't be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills.",0,0,0,0,1,0
My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because they're paying for those who aren't.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And I think it's time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Anne, let me just say before I answer your question that I didn't know that the Vice President attacked our program in Massachusetts.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it's a model for what I hope we can do across the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine.",0,0,0,0,1,0
It was in 1964 and that's what he called Medicare.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, he was wrong then and he's wrong now.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Let me say this about AIDS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency we've had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done carefully and responsibly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we're both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we're on the right track.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The NIH is doing a good job in research.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The Surgeon General is doing a good job in encouraging the proper kind of education.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I notice that the Governor did not mention any testing.,0,1,1,0,0,1
But we got to have a knowledge base.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Testing should be confidential, but we have to have a knowledge.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm Chairman of the President's Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We cannot have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it comes to operations and surgery and things of this nature.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I don't question his passion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I question - and I don't question his concern about the war in Vietnam.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He introduced or supported legislation back then that suggested that kids of Massachusetts should be exempt from going overseas in that war.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, that's a certain passion that in my view it's misguided passion.",0,0,1,0,0,0
He - we have a big difference on issues.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"You see, last year in the primary, he expressed his passion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said, ""I am a strong liberal Democrat"" - August, '87.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then he said, ""I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
That was what he said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He is out there on out of the mainstream.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My argument with the governor is, do we want this country to go that far left.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I wish we had time to let me explain.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I salute him for his passion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I've done him an injustice, and he didn't say it, I'm very, very sorry.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But I don't agree with a lot of - most of the positions of the ACLU.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I don't want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I like those ratings systems.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.,0,0,1,0,0,1

"I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he's coming from He has every right to do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I believe that's not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesn't matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus.",0,0,0,0,0,0

They taught me that this was the greatest country in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm in public service because I love this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And nobody's going to question my patriotism as the vice president has now repeatedly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The fact of the matter is if the Pledge of Allegiance was the acid test of one's patriotism--the vice president's been the presiding officer in the United States Senate for the past seven and a half years.,0,0,0,0,1,1
To the best of my knowledge he's never once suggested that a session of the Senate begin with the Pledge of Allegiance.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Mr. Bush, I don't question your patriotism.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"When you're attacked for your military record, I immediately said it was inappropriate, it had no place in this campaign, and I rejected it.",1,0,1,0,1,0
"I would hope that from this point on, we get to the issues that affect the vast majority of Americans, jobs, schools, health care, housing, the environment.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker's wife.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The government has a role.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is to fully fund the McKinney Act.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it's rough.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And so I think that we're on the right track.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we're on the track on this one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But - and I, look, mental - that was a little overstated it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I'd say around 30 percent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because there is a major problem there.,0,0,1,0,0,0
A lot of them are mentally sick.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don't have health insurance.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And when you do that, you've have homeless families.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And I think the housing community is ready.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it's going to take a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream.",0,0,0,0,0,1

This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I certainly hope not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's all a question of what our priorities are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Bush talked about values.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Isn't providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isn't it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that's part of the American dream?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didn't sit around.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We went out and built housing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a question of organizing the housing community.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Washington, by itself, can't do it all.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But governors are ready; mayors are ready.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Builders and community leaders are ready.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It will require some funds, John.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But that, too, will require some choices.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Well, that's a choice we have to make, isn't it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Because it's so essential to our economic strength and to our future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn't do.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Let's talk about housing which the question was.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Ten days before I took the oath of office as president they were 21 and a half percent.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We are serving a million more families now.,1,0,0,0,1,0
"But we're not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I want to see more vouchers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They're half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, they'll be a lot less.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"No, I don't think there is.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm opposed to the death penalty.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I think everybody knows that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm also very tough on violent crime.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America.,1,0,0,0,1,1
It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"It's one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think most people do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The question is who makes the decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the Massachusetts furlough program was unique.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole.,1,0,1,0,1,1
The federal program doesn't do that.,1,0,1,0,0,1
No other state programs do that.,1,0,0,1,1,0
And I favor the death penalty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know it's tough and honest people can disagree.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I do believe it would be inhibiting.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn't want him to be furloughed again.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think most people know my position on the sanctity of life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do not favor abortion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I haven't sorted out the penalties.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And if we can get this law changed, everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kids that are unwanted and sometimes aborted, take the - let them come to birth, and then put them in a family where they will be loved.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"And you see, yes, my position has evolved.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it's continuing to evolve, and it's evolving in favor of life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support - rape, incest and the life of the mother.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it's much clearer for me now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As I've seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But no, I'm for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there's got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It's as simple as that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what he is saying, if I understand him correctly, is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this choice.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that's the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I respect his right to disagree with me.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I think it's important that we have a position, that we take it, and we state it to the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you're talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do strongly support the WIC program.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it is good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we're going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that's why I'm a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so it's a combination of these things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm for Head Start and moving that up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I've already made a proposal - and yes, it will cost some money.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, I must have been living through a different eight years then the ones the vice president's been living through, because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed programs for children, for nutrition, for the kinds of things that can help these youngsters to live better lives.",1,0,0,0,0,1
It's cut federal aid to education; it's cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just give you one other example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"It's taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they're still resisting.",1,0,1,0,0,1
That's the way you help people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Being haunted, a thousand points of light - I don't know what that means.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know what strong political leadership is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"These programs have been cut and slashed and butchered, and they've hurt kids all over this country.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Well, I said a few minutes ago, Peter, that you could improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the same time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Welfare reform is one way to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don't lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely.",1,0,1,0,0,1
One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know the private sector is.,0,0,1,0,0,0
People are all over the country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But it takes presidential leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the kind of presidency I want to lead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What troubles me is that when I talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different ways to help on these problems, the man has just said he doesn't understand what I'm talking about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They think the only way to do it is for the federal government to do it all.,0,0,1,0,0,1
The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.,1,0,1,0,0,1
But here's the point he misses.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We've gotten away fro values and the fundamentals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we can do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But itÃâ‚¬s not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Of course that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency.,0,0,1,0,0,1
I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And yet some of our finest presidents, some of our strongest international leaders were governors-Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not the length of your resume.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's your strength, it's your values, it's the quality of the people you pick.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you're in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The vice president has a long resume.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it.",1,0,0,0,0,1
His experience didn't prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama.,0,0,1,0,0,1
He went to Philippines in the early 80Ãâ‚¬s and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And he continues to support a failed policy in Central America which is getting worse and worse, and which has in fact increased Cuban and Soviet influence in that region.",1,0,1,0,1,1
So I don't believe that the fact you've got that long resume or had that experience is the real question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm ready to provide that leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to be the commander in chief of this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros.",1,0,0,0,0,1
But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I thought the question was about defense.",0,0,1,0,0,0
The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, we're sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms, and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability.",0,0,1,0,0,0
That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Met Mr. Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But now we have a chance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"As to Ferdinand Marcos, he isn't there any more.",0,0,1,0,1,1
It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"I flew a combat mission, my last one was over Manila.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And he was down there fighting against imperialism.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And he just lifted martial law.,1,0,0,0,1,0
And he just called for new elections.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I don't think it's a question of eliminating.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can tell him some I'm against.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I can go on and on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game.",0,0,1,0,0,0

We're going to have to-the MX.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wouldn't it be nice to be perfect?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?,0,0,0,0,0,0

We will do what we do best.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a strategy that we've been working on for a couple of years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces.,0,0,1,0,0,0

I want to be the president that gets conventional forces balance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Which means, of course, that uh - we will have to maintain an adequate military capability - which means, of course, that we will have to add a uh - I think uh - a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces - adequate conventional forces.",0,1,1,0,0,1

The American people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh - four years.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"Doesn't your policy really imply that we're going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that we're not gonna be able to do much - very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"overlapping, aren't those the real costs?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"No, Mr. Kraft, we're spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh - by the federal government at the present time for human needs.",1,1,1,0,1,1
Now we will probably need to increase that to same extent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I believe we can meet the problems within the cities of this country and still uh - give a tax reduction.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.",1,0,0,1,1,1

Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Mr. Ford's own uh - environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he's uh - president.,1,1,1,1,1,1

The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think that this uh - is one example where uh - a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh - energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh - gasoline, to cut down on the uh - speed of automobiles.",0,1,0,1,0,1

"I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At the other extreme, uh - just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family who's still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country.",0,1,0,0,0,0
I know I'm ready for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the American people are too.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and uh - Watergate and uh - the CIA revelations, people have feel - have felt that they've uh been betrayed by public officials, I have to admit that in the uh - heat of the campaign - I've been in thirty primaries during the springtime, I've been campaigning for twenty-two months - I've made some mistakes.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And I think this is uh - uh - part of uh - of just being a human being.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I - I have to say that my campaign has been an open one.,0,1,0,0,0,0
And uh - the Playboy thing has been of great - very great concern to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't know how to deal with it exactly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Uh - I uh - agreed to give the interview uh - to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable - uh - Governor Jerry Brown, uh - Walter Cronkite, uh - Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford's own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh - William Buckley - many other people.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"But they weren't running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again.",0,1,1,1,0,0
"If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my - my deep Christian beliefs and uh - condemnation and sinfulness, I'll use another forum besides Playboy.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford's campaign, and uh - I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past - we've both made some mistakes - and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people.",0,0,1,0,0,1

"We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, uh - a great many uh - allegations of wrong-doing, of uh - alleged immorality, uh - those are very disturbing to the American people.",0,1,1,1,1,1
They wonder how an elected representative uh - can serve them and participate in such activities uh - serving in the Congress of the United States.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Yes, and I'm certain many, many Americans were turned off by the revelations of Watergate, a very, very uh - bad period of time in American political history.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Yes, and thousands, maybe millions of Americans were turned off because of the uh - problems that came out of our involvement in Vietnam.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh - there is a - a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"Now, like uh - any hardworking uh - person seeking public office uh - in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh - rather graphic language and I'm guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when we're asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh - we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Mr. uh - Nelson, uh - I testified before two committees, House and Senate, on precisely the questions that you have asked.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I said I had no recollection whatsoever of talking with any of the White House legislative liaison people.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, in the meantime, the special prosecutor, within the last few days, after an investigation himself, said there was no reason for him to get involved because he found nothing that would justify it.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And then just a day or two ago, the attorney general of the United States made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"Those tapes are in the jurisdiction of the courts and I have no right to say ""yes"" or ""no.""",0,0,1,0,0,1
"But all the committees, the attorney general, the special prosecutor, all of them have given me a clean bill of health.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the matter is settled once and for all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's for the uh - proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision.,0,0,1,0,0,0

And I've told everything I know about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the matter is settled once and for all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't have a response.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the last uh - two weeks, I've had a chance to talk to uh - two men who have visited uh - the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"One is Governor Avell- Averell Harriman, who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the other is James Schlesinger, whom I think you accompanied to uh - China.",0,1,0,0,0,1
I got a- a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished - uh - gentlemen.,1,1,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think it's accurate to say that there is no uh - prospect in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading uh - Yugoslavia should uh - Mr. Tito pass away.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"The present leadership uh - there is uh - is fairly uniform in - in their purpose, and I think it's a close-knit group, uh - and uh - I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh - in Yugoslavia uh - if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"I have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign, and this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question, that I would never uh - go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened.",0,1,1,0,0,1
And uh - I don't believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh - into Yugoslavia.,0,0,1,0,0,1
I certainly hope it won't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would take eh - the strongest possible measures short of uh - actual military uh - action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I firmly believe, uh - Mr. Kraft, that it's unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh - options he might exercise if any uhh - international problem arose.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"I think we all recall with some sadness that at uh - the period of the nin- late nineteen forties, early nineteen fifties, there were some indications that the United States would not include uh - South Korea in an area of defense.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea.",0,0,1,0,1,1
It's a fact they did.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"It's far better for a person sitting in the White House uh - who has a number of options to make certain that the uh - other side, so to speak, doesn't know precisely what you're going to do.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And therefore, that was the reason that I would not uh - identify any particular course of action uh - when I responded to a question a week or so ago.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I have indicated to General Brown that uh - the words that he used in that interview, in that particular case and in several others, were very ill advised.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And General Brown has indicated uh - his apology, his regrets, and I think that will, uh - in this situation, settle the matter.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"It is tragic that uh - the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Not this one, however, that you bring up.",0,0,1,0,0,0
General Brown has an exemply [sic] record of military performance.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think it's the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field, that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in America today.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now he did use uh - ill-advised words, but I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh - does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that's we so badly need as we enter into uh - negotiations uh - under the SALT II agreement, or if we have operations that might be developing uh in the Middle East or southern Africa, in the Pacific, uh - we need a man with that experience, that knowledge, that know-how, and I think, in light of the fact that he has uh - apologized, uh - would not have justified my asking for his resignation.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"Well, just briefly, I - I think this is uh - the second time that General Brown has made a statement that - for which he did have to apologize.",0,0,1,0,1,1
I think the first one was related to uh - the unwarranted influence of American Jews on the media and uh - in the Congress.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This one concerned uh - Great Britain.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I think he said that Israel was a - a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire.,1,0,1,1,0,1
Ah - I'm not uh - sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had - had expressed uh - his concern about the statement or apologized for it.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"This is uh - something, though, that I think uh - is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and - and I think the only criticism that I would have uh - on - of Mr. Ford is that uh - immediately when the statement was re - re - revealed, uh - perhaps a - a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing.",0,1,1,0,0,1
I don't believe it does.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Uh - I began campaigning uh - twenty-two months ago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Uh - very few people knew who I was.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didn't hold public office, didn't have very much money.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And we built up uh - an awareness among the uh - voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered - thirty of them, nobody's ever done that before - about who I was and what I stood for.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd say, several hundred of them.",0,0,1,0,1,0
And they're very fine and very highly qualified.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I chose Senator Walter Mondale.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the only criterion I ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president, if something should happen to me and to join me in being vice president if I should serve out my term.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'm convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I've never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration - Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States?",0,0,1,0,0,1
I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the last five pres- vice presidential uh - nominees, uh - incumbents, three of them have become president.",0,1,0,0,0,1
But I think this is indicative of what I would do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Governor may not have heard my uh - established criteria for the selection of a vice president, but uh - it was a well-established criteria that the person I selected would be fully qualified to be president of the United States.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh - very high responsibilities on important committees.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"I don't mean to be critical of uh - Senator Mondale, but uh - I was uh - very, very surprised when I read that uh - Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh - after the news story that uh - broke about General Brown.",0,1,1,0,0,1
If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I think our selection uh - of Bob Dole as vice president uh - is based on merit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if he should ever become uh - the president of the United States, with his vast experience as member the House and a member of the Senate, as well as a vice president, I think he would do an outstanding job as president of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's a tribute to their interest in this election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh - thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"Number two, that strip-mining bill would've severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh - Arab oil supply.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"So, I vetoed it because of a loss of jobs and because it would've interfered with our energy independence program.",1,0,1,0,1,0
"The auto emissions - uh - it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh - heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified.",1,1,0,1,1,1
But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program.",1,0,0,0,0,1
Uh - I have uh - added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service.,1,1,0,0,0,1
"For example, we uh - proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service.",1,1,0,1,1,1
"And a month or so ago I did uh - likewise say over the next ten years we should expand - double - this national parks, the wild wilderness areas, the scenic river areas.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And then, of course, the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This uh - administration's record on environment is very bad.,0,1,1,0,0,0
Uh - I think it's accurate to say that the uh - strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress - uh - and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden - would have been good for the country.,1,1,1,0,1,1
"The claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh - hard to believe, when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was uh - supporting the bill.",1,1,1,1,1,1
And I don't think they would have supported the uh - bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs.,1,1,1,0,1,1
There's been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that would've gone to uh - cities and others to control uh - water pollution.",1,1,1,0,1,1
We have no energy policy.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh - energy uh - forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor.",0,1,0,0,0,1
The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh - be clean.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"We need a heritage trust program, similar to the one we had in Georgia, to set aside additional lands that have uh - geological and archeological importance, uh natural areas for enjoyment.",0,1,0,1,0,1
Uh - the lands that Mr. Ford uh - brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh - in size.,0,1,1,1,1,1
"But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, it's very uh - far in the future.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"We've taken no strong position in the uh - control of pollution of our oceans, and I would say the worst uh - threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I'd be glad to.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the first place, uh - as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh - of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"It's impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can't anticipate what's gonna happen next.",0,0,0,0,0,1

I think it's very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh - the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth.,1,1,0,0,0,1
Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed.",0,1,0,1,0,0
"Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We have now uh - for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government.,1,1,1,0,1,1
"When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent.",1,1,1,1,1,1
That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh - tremendously.",1,1,0,0,0,1
"We've got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh - particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent.",1,0,1,0,0,1

One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh - New York City is to - is to finance welfare.,0,1,0,1,0,1

"Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Ford administration does have a very comprehensive program to help uh - our major metropolitan areas.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want.",1,1,0,1,1,1
In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development.,1,1,0,1,1,1

The uh - description just made of this administration's record is hard to uh - recognize.,0,1,1,1,0,1
I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh - Voting Rights Acts and the uh - Civil Rights Acts in their uh - debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it.,1,1,1,1,0,1

It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I - I'm strongly against a- abortion.,0,0,1,0,0,0

Uh I call that the people amendment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh - we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Uh - I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.,0,0,0,0,0,0

But they're matters that are ah - important.,0,0,0,0,0,0

The record just doesn't prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I don't believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Those are the people who ought to be in jail.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime.",0,0,1,0,1,0
And uh - the individuals that uh - with whom I've consulted have not uh - convinced me that uh - a national registration of handguns or handgun owners will solve the problem you're talking about.,0,0,1,0,0,1
The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it's registered or outlawed.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And they are the people who ought to go behind bars.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I - I think it's accurate to say that Mr. Ford's position on gun control has changed.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"Uh - earlier, uh - Mr. Levi, his uh - attorney general, put forward a gun control proposal, which Mr. Ford later, I believe, espoused, that called for the prohibition against the uh sale aw- of the uh - so-called Saturday Night Specials.",1,1,1,1,1,1
And it would've put uh - very strict uh - uh - control over who owned a handgun.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"I have been a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotguns, rifles, and a handgun.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that's as far as I would go with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"We uh - streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh - severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of - for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and - and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Civil rights - uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn't been uh - reversed, and I don't think there's any inclination to reverse those basic decisions.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh - s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley - uh populated areas of - of the states.",0,1,0,1,0,1
The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel.,0,1,0,1,0,0
Uh - I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court.,1,0,1,0,0,1
Also the - the protection of an arrested person against unwarranted persecution in trying to get a false uh - confession.,0,1,1,1,0,0
But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty.,1,0,1,0,1,1
And I think that in that case uh - some of the more liberal uh - members of the uh - so-called Warren Court agreed with those decisions.,1,1,1,0,0,0
"But the only uh - thing I uh - have pointed out was, what I've just said, and that there was a need to clarify the technicalities so that you couldn't be forced to release a person who was obviously guilty just because of a - of a small technicality in the law.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And - and that's a reversal of position uh by the Burger Court with which I do agree.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"Okay, I thought I answered it by saying that it would be on the basis of merit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Once the uh - search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I'm given a list of the five or seven or ten uh - best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh - persons.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"If the uh - list was, uh - in my opinion, fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi- political philosophy as best I could determine it.",0,1,1,0,0,0
Which would be uh - to continue the progress that has been made under the last two uh - courts - the Warren Court and the Burger Court.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would also like to uh - completely revise our criminal justice system - to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that I've just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And then I would like to appoint people who would be interested in helping with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know that uh Chief Justice Burger is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He hasn't had help from the administration, from the Congress, to carry this out.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"The uh - emphasis, I think, of the - of the court system uh - should be to interpret the uh - the Constitution and the laws uh - equally between property protection and personal protection.",0,1,0,1,0,0
But when there's uh - a very narrow decision - which quite often there's one that reaches the Supreme Court - I think the choice should be with human rights.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And uh - that would be another factor that I would follow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I had one opportunity to nominate uh - an individual to the Supreme Court and I selected the Circuit Court of Appeals judge from Illinois, uh - John Paul Stevens.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"The Miranda case, uh - the Burger Court uh - is gradually changing, and I'm pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh - Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Uh - I might make a correction uh - of what uh - Governor Carter said, uh speaking of uh - uh - gun control, uh - yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of uh - Saturday Night S- Specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment.",0,0,1,0,0,0

Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent.",1,1,0,1,1,1
But do you realize that over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period?,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now it's lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter.",1,1,0,0,1,1
"But every economist - liberal, conservative that I'm familiar with - recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh - the first quarter of next year that we'll have an increase in real GNP.",0,1,0,0,0,1
But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.,1,1,0,0,1,1
We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing.,1,1,0,0,1,1
"As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year.",1,1,0,0,1,1
"Now in addition, we had a very - some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation.",1,1,0,0,0,1
And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent.",1,1,1,1,1,1
It means that the American buyer is getting a better bargain today because inflation is less.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Uh Mr. Kraft, uh - I think the record can be put in this uh - in this way, which uh - is the way that I think satisfies most Americans.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Since the depths of the recession, we have added four million jobs.",1,1,0,0,1,1
"Im- most importantly, consumer confidence as surveyed by the reputable organization at the University of Michigan is at the highest since 1972.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"In other words, there is a growing public confidence in the strength of this economy.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And that means that there will be more industrial activity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It means that there will be a reduction in the uhh - unemployment.,0,1,0,1,0,1
It means that there will be increased hires.,0,1,0,0,0,0
It means that there will be increased employment.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We're ahead of all of the Western European country.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The United States is leading the free world out of the recession that was serious a year, year and a half ago.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"We're going to see unemployment going down, more jobs available, and the rate of inflation going down.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I think this is a record that uh - the American people understand and will appreciate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We've got seven and a half million people out of jobs.,1,0,1,0,0,1

One of the overwhelming results that I've seen in the polls is that people feel that you can't plan anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Under the present administration - Nixon's and Ford's - we've had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy.,1,1,1,0,1,1
And housing starts - he compares the housing starts with last year.,0,1,0,1,0,1
"I don't blame him, because in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country, fewer homes built, than any year since 1940.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And we've got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers.,1,0,1,0,1,1
And Mr. Ford hasn't done anything about it.,1,0,1,0,0,1
And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"We'll never have a balanced budget, we'll never meet the needs of our people, we'll never control the inflationary spiral, as long as we have seven and a half or eight million people out of work, who are looking for jobs.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And we've probably got two and a half more million people who are not looking for jobs any more, because they've given up hope.",1,0,1,0,0,1
That is a very serious indictment of this administration.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It's probably the worst one of all.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around - hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Uh - just a moment ago, for example, uh - he uh - was indicating that uh - uh - in the 1950s, for example, uh - unemployment was very low.",0,1,1,1,0,1

"We - I mean in Korea - we had uh - three million five hundred thousand young men uh - in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.",1,1,0,1,1,1

"So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh - with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military - they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand.",1,1,1,1,1,1

"Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off.",1,0,0,0,0,1

That's not what I'm going to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My plan has five basic parts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That creates about 4 million jobs.,1,1,0,0,1,1
"Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're far away from that now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number four, get to us a balanced budget.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number five, champion small business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work.",1,0,0,0,0,1
That's not the right answer for America.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, we've got to improve our education system and we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent.",1,0,0,0,0,1
But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So all of this is possible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I don't have a tax cut of a scale that you're talking about.,1,0,0,0,0,0
My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people.,0,0,1,0,0,1
High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They'll do fine whether you're president or I am.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300.",1,1,0,0,1,1
This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I'll call it the economy tax.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president.",1,1,0,0,1,1
Middle-income families are being crushed.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And so the question is how to get them going again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I do, both for corporations and for individuals.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up.",1,0,0,0,0,1
But not due to his policies.,0,0,1,0,0,0
In spite of his policies.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"If I'm president, I'll double them, and also get the -- the oil from offshore and Alaska.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, by the way, I like coal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies.,1,0,1,0,0,1
I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the -- the revenues going to the government.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"My -- my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I -- and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans.",0,0,1,0,0,1
So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And that's exactly what I did.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.",1,1,0,0,1,1
"And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.,1,0,1,0,1,0
"The problem is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit or -- or -- or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, that's not my analysis.",0,0,1,0,0,0
That's the analysis of economists who have looked at this.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"And -- and that kind of top -- top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut.,0,0,1,0,1,1
What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit.,0,0,0,0,1,1
So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I've got five boys.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that -- that is not the case.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I will lower taxes on middle-income families.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, you cite a study.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"I saw a study that came out today that said you're going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.",0,0,0,0,1,1
There are all these studies out there.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But let's get at the bottom line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That is, I want to bring down rates.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And you'd think, well, then why lower the rates?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"For me, this is about jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is about getting jobs for the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, ""Never mind.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times.",1,0,0,0,1,1
And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under -- under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators, they'd be burdened.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Donald Trump is a small business.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And I think that would be a mistake.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Jim, let me just come back on that -- on that point, which is these...",0,0,0,0,0,0
... the small businesses we're talking about...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, President, you're -- Mr. President, you're absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not -- not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they're taxed at a lower rate.",1,0,1,0,0,1
But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in small business.,1,0,1,0,0,1
Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, and -- and I've talked to a guy who has a very small business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.",1,1,0,0,1,1
I don't want to cost jobs.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there's nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion -- just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that's more than our entire defense budget -- and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's plan may work for you.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We created 23 million new jobs.,1,1,0,0,1,1
We went from deficit to surplus.,1,0,0,0,1,0
And businesses did very well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, in some ways, we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they've got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, but he gets the first word of that segment.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I get the last word (inaudible) I hope.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just make this comment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think first of all, let me -- let me repeat -- let me repeat what I said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut.,0,0,1,0,0,0
My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that's not my plan.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Number two, let's look at history.",0,0,0,0,0,0
My plan is not like anything that's been tried before.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.",0,0,0,0,0,1
My priority is putting people back to work in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're suffering in this country.,0,0,1,0,1,1
And we talk about evidence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Look at the evidence of the last four years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"It's just -- it's -- we've got -- when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.",1,0,0,0,1,1
Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm glad you raised that, and it's a -- it's a critical issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think it's, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they're going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.",1,0,1,0,0,1
So how do we deal with it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"One, of course, is to raise taxes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Number two is to cut spending.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they're paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The presidents would -- president would prefer raising taxes.,0,0,1,0,0,0
The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth.,1,0,1,0,0,1
And you could never quite get the job done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it?",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And if not, I'll get rid of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I use that term with all respect, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I'll get rid of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm sorry, Jim, I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to stop other things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I like PBS, I love Big Bird.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Number three, I'll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The president said he'd cut the deficit in half.,1,0,0,0,1,1
Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years.,1,0,1,0,1,1
The president's put it in place as much public debt -- almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me.",1,0,0,0,1,0
And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren't working very well, 18 government -- 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren't helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget.,1,0,1,0,0,1
That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, we all know that we've got to do more.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let -- let me just finish their point, because you're looking for contrast.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue?",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It means that Governor Romney...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And -- and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I have my own plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But in my view, the president should have grabbed it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan...",1,0,0,0,0,1
But you've been -- but you've been president four years...,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've been president four years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You said you'd cut the deficit in half.,1,0,0,0,0,1
It's now four years later.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We still have trillion-dollar deficits.,1,0,1,0,1,1
The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year.",1,0,1,0,0,1
That doesn't get the job done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me come back and say, why is it that I don't want to raise taxes?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Why don't I want to raise taxes on people?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And actually, you said it back in 2010.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You said, ""Look, I'm going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we're in recession, you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone.""",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, the economy is still growing slow.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"As a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"And so if you believe the same thing, you just don't want to raise taxes on people.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump.,0,0,1,0,0,1
It's not just Donald Trump you're taxing.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It's all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals.,1,0,0,0,0,1
You raise taxes and you kill jobs.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs.",1,0,0,0,1,1
I don't want to kill jobs in this environment.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'll make one more point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we've had this discussion before.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There has to be revenue in addition to cuts.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes.",1,0,0,0,0,1
That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you'll never get there.",0,0,1,0,0,0
You'll never balance the budget by raising taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government.,1,0,0,0,1,1
We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government.,1,0,0,0,1,1
I don't want to go down the path to Spain.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they're working.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If -- if we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Let's talk about corporate taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they're making money every time you go to the pump?",0,0,1,0,0,1
Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets?,0,0,1,0,0,1
"My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn't identified which ones they are -- but that thereby bring down the corporate rate.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And all that raises revenue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me -- she's got 42 kids in her class.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The first two weeks she's got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned.",0,0,0,0,1,1
They're using text books that are 10 years old.,1,0,1,0,0,1
That is not a recipe for growth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not how America was built.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And so budgets reflect choices.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that's a big problem.",0,0,0,0,0,1
There's no doubt about it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid.,0,0,0,0,0,1
What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jim, let's -- we've gone on a lot of topics there, and so it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas.",0,0,1,0,0,0
So let's go through them one by one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's time to end it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And you say Exxon and Mobil.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Of course it's on the table.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
So this -- this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Look, I've been in business for 25 years.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I have no idea what you're talking about.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I maybe need to get a new accountant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.,0,0,1,0,0,0
What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, finally, Medicaid to states?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Social Security is structurally sound.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But it is -- the basic structure is sound.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But -- but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that's the big driver of our deficits right now.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, my grandmother -- some of you know -- helped to raise me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
My grandfather died a while back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And she was fiercely independent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And she ended up living alone by choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going.",0,0,0,0,0,1
$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.,1,0,0,0,0,1
So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don't need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, I just thought about one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn't proposing any changes for current retirees.",0,0,1,0,0,1
In fact he is on Medicare.,1,0,0,0,1,1
On Social Security he's not.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program.",1,1,0,0,1,1
"Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"Actually just going to them and saying, ""We're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate.""",1,0,0,0,0,1
That's not just going after places where there's abuse.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That's saying we're cutting the rates.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.,1,0,0,0,1,1
We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.,1,0,0,0,0,1
This -- we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts.,1,0,0,0,1,1
I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to give a better prescription program.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut.,1,0,0,0,0,1
They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And let me explain why.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... people, right, not for current retirees.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For -- so if you're -- if you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen 'cause this -- this will affect you.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But there's still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I don't think vouchers are the right way to go.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And this is not my own -- only my opinion.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years.",1,0,0,0,1,1
Benefits were not affected at all.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, ""Obamacare,"" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care.",1,0,1,0,1,1
They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier.,1,0,1,0,1,1
And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.,1,0,0,0,1,1
So that's -- that's number one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000.",1,0,0,0,0,1
That's not going to happen.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They'll have at least two plans.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd rather be able to have an insurance company.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But people make their own choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we're going to have to lower some of the benefits.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We have to make sure this program is there for the long term.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the plan that I've put forward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And private insurers have to make a profit.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially.,0,0,1,0,1,1
And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One last point I want to make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... ",0,0,0,0,0,1
... but -- but -- but overall.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's -- that's a big topic.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is that a -- is that a separate topic?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Let's get back to Medicare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's get back to Medicare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But my experience -- my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You couldn't have people opening up banks in their -- in their garage and making loans.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Every free economy has good regulation.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"At the same time, regulation can become excessive.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, it can become out of date.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the president's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Let me give you an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government.",1,0,1,0,1,1
This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is an enormous boon for them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"Well, I would repeal and replace it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We're not going to get rid of all regulation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have to have regulation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for...",0,0,0,0,0,1
But let's -- let's mention -- let me mention the other one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think this is a great example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify.",1,0,1,0,1,1
You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford.,0,0,1,0,0,1
You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.",0,0,1,0,1,1
So what did we do?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"We said you've got -- banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that's not what I believe.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That's why I'd have regulation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.,1,0,1,0,0,0
It wasn't thought through properly.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified.,0,0,1,0,0,1
It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Try and get a mortgage these days.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.,1,0,1,0,0,1
It's not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And -- and we've got to deal with cost.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance.",1,0,1,0,1,1
So it's adding to cost.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Instead, it's gone up by that amount.",1,0,1,0,0,1
So that's one reason I don't want it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it.",1,0,1,0,1,1
I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I don't like that idea.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what's been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans?",0,0,0,0,0,1
And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"I just don't know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And so as a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don't have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they've hit the limit.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.",1,0,0,0,0,0
And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover.",0,0,0,0,0,1
You keep your own insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You keep your own doctor.,1,0,0,0,0,0
But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits.,1,0,1,0,1,1
They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, the last point I'd make before...",0,0,1,0,0,0
"No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was ...",0,0,1,0,0,0
"... the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, I did with my first statement.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together.",0,0,0,0,0,1
What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished.",1,0,0,0,0,1
You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion.",1,0,0,0,1,1
We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"We didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.",1,1,0,0,0,1
"So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don't want Medicare -- don't want Obamacare.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They put a plan out.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan.",1,0,0,0,1,0
"I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis.,0,0,0,0,0,1
This was a bipartisan idea.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"In fact, it was a Republican idea.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?",0,0,0,0,0,1
Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And there are ways of doing it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And the reason they do is because they do some smart things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They -- they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's -- let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they've -- they've engaged in.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So we're already beginning to see progress.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate.",1,0,0,0,0,1
Let me make one last point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance...",1,0,1,0,1,1
... at a time when it's vitally important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, actually it's -- it's -- it's a lengthy description.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's already offered in the private marketplace.,1,0,0,0,0,1
You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But let's come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the private market.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's the wrong way to go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The private market and individual responsibility always work best.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.,1,0,0,0,0,0
That's explicitly prohibited in the law.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've -- if it's been under 90 days.",1,0,0,0,0,1
But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions.,1,0,0,0,0,1
There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It wasn't a government takeover of health care.,1,0,0,0,0,1
It was the largest expansion of private insurance.,1,1,0,0,1,1
"But what it does say is that ""insurers, you've got to take everybody.""",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, that also means that you've got more customers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when -- when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones.",0,0,1,0,1,1
He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.,1,0,0,0,0,0
I -- I have to respond to that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Which is -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay down a piece of legislation and say, ""It's my way or the highway,"" I don't get a lot done.",0,0,0,0,0,1
What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He said he was going to lower tax rates.,1,0,0,0,1,0
He said he was going to broaden the base.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.",1,0,0,0,0,1
I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One way, for instance, would be to have a single number.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Anybody can have deductions up to that amount.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And then that number disappears for high-income people.,1,0,1,0,0,0
That's one way one could do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan.",1,0,0,0,0,0
You obviously studied up on -- on my plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's part of my health care plan.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I said that at that time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, I definitely think there are differences.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's its most basic function.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I've worked on and thought about every single day that I've been in the Oval Office.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let's start the National Academy of Sciences, let's start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off.",1,0,0,0,0,1
That doesn't restrict people's freedom.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And so what I've tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And when it comes to education what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working.,1,0,0,0,0,0
We use something called Race to the Top.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wasn't a top-down approach, Governor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What we've said is to states, we'll give you more money if you initiate reforms.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"But what I've also said is let's hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed.",1,0,0,0,0,0
And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"In fact we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It can't do it all, but it can make a difference.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And as a consequence we'll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we've got a skilled workforce.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, first, I love great schools.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And the key to great schools, great teachers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The role of government: Look behind us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do not believe in cutting our military.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by -- by one another.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work.,1,0,1,0,1,1
The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps.,1,0,0,0,1,1
The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work.,1,0,0,0,0,1
We know that the path we're taking is not working.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's time for a new path.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But the federal government also can play a very important role.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I -- and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he's -- some ideas he's put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and -- and congratulate him for pursuing that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a better job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My own view, by the way, is I've added to that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or -- or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"You know, his -- his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And it wasn't very detailed.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This seems to be a trend.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just finish the point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just say one final example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And we said, ""Why not cut out the middleman?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, ""you should borrow money from your parents to go to college,"" you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don't have that option.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's how we're going to grow this economy over the long term.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All right, I'm not going to cut education funding.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't have any plan to cut education funding and -- and grants that go to people going to college.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I'm planning on (inaudible) to grow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I'm not planning on making changes there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"$90 billion, that would have -- that would have hired 2 million teachers.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business.",1,0,1,0,1,1
A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Look, the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?",0,0,0,0,0,0
How do we get schools to be more competitive?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to cut our commitment to education.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, I've had that experience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't just talk about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation.,1,0,0,0,0,1
This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's because I care about education for all of our kids.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've done a great job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn't seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We drove our schools to be number one in the nation.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We cut taxes 19 times.,1,1,0,0,0,1
"We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but because there's common ground.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And we face -- this deficit could crush the future generations.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause.,1,0,1,0,0,1
That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"That's how we repealed ""don't ask/don't tell.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So we've -- we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, ""I'll sit down,"" but you have to have a plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"When -- when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.",0,0,0,0,0,0

There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.,0,0,1,0,0,1

If the president were to be reelected you're going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare.,1,0,0,0,1,1

"In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Our country is not strong anymore; we're not respected anymore.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We can only be strong overseas if we're strong at home; and when I became president we'll not only be strong in those areas but also in defense - a defense capability second to none.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We've lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've uh - ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It's been one of secrecy and exclusion.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"In addition to that we've had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we've excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies.",0,0,0,1,0,0
In addition to that we've become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Soviet Union knows what they want in detente, and they've been getting it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We have not known what we've wanted and we've been out-traded in almost every instance.,0,0,1,0,1,1
The other point I wanna make is about our defense.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've got to be a nation blessed with a defense capability that's efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused - fighting capability.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The ability to fight, if necessary, is the best way to avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh - continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration.,1,0,1,0,1,1
This is one instance where I agree with - with the Republican platform.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I might say this in closing, and that is that as far as foreign policy goes, Mr. Kissinger has been the president of this country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Mr. Ford has shown an absence of leadership, and an absence of a grasp of what this country is and what it ought to be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's got to be changed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor Carter again is talking in broad generalities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me take just one question that he raises - the military strength and capability of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And more recently, he talks about cutting the defense budget by five to seven billion dollars.",1,0,0,0,0,1
There is no way you can be strong militarily and have those kind of reductions in our military uh - appropriation.,0,1,0,0,0,0
Now let me just tell you a little story.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"About uh - late October of 1975, I asked the then Secretary of Defense, Mr. Schlesinger, to tell me what had to be done if we were going to reduce the defense budget by uh - three to five billion dollars.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"A few days later, Mr. Schlesinger came back and said if we cut the defense budget by three to five billion dollars, we will have to cut military personnel by two hundred and fifty thousand, civilian personnel by a hundred thousand, jobs in America by a hundred thousand.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"We would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement, we would have to reduce our naval construction program, we would have to reduce the uh - research and development for the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and Marines by 8 percent.",0,1,0,1,1,1
We would have to close twenty military bases in the United States immediately.,1,0,1,0,0,1
That's the kind of defense program that uh - Mr. Carter wants.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I don't believe we should move to a cold-war relationship.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think it's in the best interest of the United States, and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I don't uh - look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We have been successful in Portugal, where a year ago it looked like there was a very great possibility that the uh - Communists would take over in Portugal.",0,1,1,0,0,1
We have a democracy in Portugal today.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"A few uh - months ago, or I should say, maybe two years ago, the Soviet Union looked like they had continued strength in the Middle East.",1,0,1,1,0,1
"Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"The facts are, there - the Soviet Union relationship with Egypt is uh - at a low level.",1,1,1,1,0,1
The Soviet Union relationship with Syria is at a very low point.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"The United States today, according to Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, is a- at a peak in its uh - influence and power in the Middle East.",0,1,0,0,0,1
But let's turn for a minute to the uhh - southern African operations that are now going on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The United States of America took the initiative in southern Africa.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We wanted to have the right of self-determination in southern Africa.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We wanted to preserve human dignity in southern Africa.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have taken the initiative, and in southern Africa today the United States is trusted by the black front-line nations and black Africa.",1,0,0,0,0,1
The United States is trusted by other elements in southern Africa.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I believe that instead of talking about Soviet progress, we can talk about American successes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And may I make an observation - part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Mr. Carter has indicated he would look with sympathy to a Communist government in NATO.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, Mr. Ford, unfortunately, has just made a statement that's not true.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I have never advocated a Communist government for Italy.,1,0,1,0,0,1
That would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who wanted to be president of this country.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think that this is uh - an instance of uh - deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"As a matter of fact, uh - I've never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"As a matter of fact, Mr. Ford has made a political football out of the defense budget.",1,0,1,0,1,1
About a year ago he cut the Pentagon budget six point eight billion dollars.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget.",1,1,0,0,1,1
And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, we went into south Africa late, after Great Britain, Rhodesia, the black nations had been trying to solve this problem for many, many years.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"We didn't go in until right before the election, similar to what was taking place in 1972, when Mr. Kissinger announced peace is at hand just before the election at that time.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've got a little ways to go before I start doing that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I have uh - an adequate background, I believe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh - Eisenhower.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"I've served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I've traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've talked to them and I've listened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I've seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt that's come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"What we were formerly so proud of - the strength of our country, its uh - moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And in the secrecy that has surrounded our foreign policy in the last few years, uh - the American people, the Congress have been excluded.",0,0,1,1,0,0
I believe I know what this country ought to be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've uh - been one who's loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there's no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources - militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Every time we've made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it's been because the American people have been excluded from the process.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don't require long experience in foreign policy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody has that except a president who has served a long time or a secretary of state.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But my background, my experience, my knowledge of the people of this country, my commitment to our principles that don't change - those are the best bases to correct the horrible mistakes of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I would quit conducting the decision-making process in secret, as has been a characteristic of Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Ford.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"Recently Ian Smith, the uh - president of uh - Rhodesia, announced that he had unequivocal commitments from Mr. Kissinger that he could not reveal.",1,1,1,0,1,1
The American people don't know what those commitments are.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We've seen uh - in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there.",1,0,1,0,0,1
These kinds of things have hurt us very much.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I would restore the concept of the fireside chat, which was an integral part of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
When Harry Truman was president he was not afraid to have a strong secretary of defense.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh - state - excuse me - state.",0,1,0,1,0,0
But he also made sure that there was a bipartisan support.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The members of Congress, Arthur Vandenberg, Walter George, were part of the process, and before our nation made a secret agreement, or before we made a bluffing statement, we were sure that we had the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state, but also of the Congress and the people.",1,0,0,0,1,1
This is a responsibility of the president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's very damaging to our country for Mr. Ford to have turned over this responsibility to the secretary of state.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Governor Carter again contradicts himself.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He complains about secrecy and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union - I presume for the purpose of an - imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations.,1,1,1,1,0,1
But let me talk just a minute about what we've done to avoid secrecy in the Ford administration.,0,0,1,0,0,0
After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement - and I'm proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"But at the time that uh - I submitted the Sinai agreement to the Congress of the United States, I submitted every single document that was applicable to the Sinai II agreement.",1,1,0,1,0,1
It was the most complete documentation by any president of any agreement signed by a president on behalf of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I've been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress - both House and Senate.",1,0,0,0,0,1
The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.,1,0,0,0,1,1
The secretary of state has made better than fifty speeches all over the United States explaining American foreign policy.,1,0,0,0,0,1
I have made myself at least ten uh - speeches in various parts of the country where I have discussed with the American people defense and foreign policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that we have uh - negotiated with the Soviet Union since I've been president from a position of strength.,1,0,0,1,0,1
And let me cite several examples.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Shortly after I became president in uh - December of 1974, I met with uh - General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred - which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"I've negotiated at Vladivostok with uh - Mr. Brezhnev a limitation on the MIRVing of their ballistic missiles at a figure of thirteen-twenty, which is the first time that any president has achieved a cap either on launchers or on MIRVs.",1,1,1,0,1,1
It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.,0,1,0,0,0,0
The grain sales have been a benefit to American agriculture.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh - sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh - have full production.",1,1,0,1,1,1
And these grain sales to the Soviet Union have helped us tremendously in meeting the costs of the additional oil and - the oil that we have bought from overseas.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"If we turn to Helsinki - I'm glad you raised it, Mr. uh - Frankel.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican - I can't under any circumstances believe that the - His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the - Eastern Europe.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, what has been accomplished by the Helsinki agreement?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, we have an agreement where they notify us and we notify them of any uh - military maneuvers that are to be be undertaken.",1,1,0,0,0,1
"In both cases where they've done so, there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford administration.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"I don't believe, uh - Mr. Frankel that uh - the Yugoslavians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I don't believe that the Rumanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.,0,0,1,0,0,1
I don't believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Each of those countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"As a matter of fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the president of the United States and the people of the United are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy and their freedom.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"(chuckle) Well, in the first place, I'm not criticizing His Holiness the Pope.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was talking about Mr. Ford.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The uh - fact is that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the Ford administration.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"In the case of the Helsinki agreement - it may have been a good agreement at the beginning, but we have failed to enforce the so-called basket three part, which insures the right of people to migrate, to join their families, to be free, to speak out.",1,1,0,0,0,1
"We've also seen a very serious uh - problem with the so-called Sonnenfeldt document, which apparently Mr. Ford has just endorsed, which said that there's an organic linkage between the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union.",1,1,1,0,1,1
And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don't live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron - uh - Curtain.,0,0,1,0,0,1
We also have seen Mr. Ford exclude himself from access to the public.,0,0,1,0,1,1
He hasn't had a tough cross-examination-type press conference in over thirty days.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He's also shown a weakness in yielding to pressure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Soviet Union, for instance, put pressure on Mr. Ford and he refused to see a symbol of human freedom recognized around the world, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and he's yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American - companies.",1,1,1,0,1,1
His own secretary of commerce had to be subpoenaed by the Congress to reveal the names of businesses who were subject to this boycott.,1,0,1,0,1,1
They didn't volunteer the information.,1,0,1,0,0,1
He had to be subpoenaed.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And the last thing I'd like to say is this: This grain deal with the Soviet Union in '72 was terrible, and Mr. Ford made up for it with three embargoes, one against our own ally in Japan.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I would never single out food as a trade embargo item.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"If I ever decided to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationships, it would include all shipments of all equipment.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"For instance, if the Arab countries ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil I would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war, and I would respond instantly and in kind.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"I would not ship that Arab country anything - no weapons, no spare parts for weapons, no oil-drilling rigs, no oil pipe, no nothing.",0,0,1,0,1,0
I wouldn't single out just food.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Another thing that I'd like to say is this: In our international trade, as I said in my op- opening statement, we have become the arms merchant of the world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"The shift in emphasis has been very disturbing to me, speaking about the Middle East.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel.,1,0,1,0,0,1
Nowadays - 75 percent were for Israel before.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Now 60 percent go to the Arab countries, and this does not include Iran.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"This is a deviation from idealism; it's a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the Middle East, which is Israel; it's a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the Arabs on the oil issue; and it's also a tremendous indication that under the Ford administration we have not addressed the energy policy adequately.",0,0,1,0,0,1
We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.,0,0,0,0,1,1
And it's an overall sign of weakness.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that's been put on us successfully.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"It would've been inconceivable ten - fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo.",0,0,1,0,1,1
But it was done three years ago and they're still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it's not just a matter of idealism.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a matter of being tough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a matter of being strong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a matter of being consistent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.,1,0,1,0,1,1
This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"If - Iran is not an Arab country, as you know, it is a Moslem country - but if Saudi Arabia should declare an oil embargo against us, then I would consider that an economic declaration of war.",0,1,1,1,0,1
And I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.,1,0,1,0,0,1
Governor Carter uh - apparently doesn't realize that since I've been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"So the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and we're dedicated to the survival and security of Israel.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that Governor Carter doesn't realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran.,0,0,1,0,0,1
He indicates he would not make those.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Iran is bordered very extensively by the Soviet Union.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"It's my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"The history of our relationship with Iran goes back to the days of President Truman when he decided that it was vitally necessary for our own security as well as that of Iran, that we should help that country, and Iran has been a good ally.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Iran continued to sell oil to the United States.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"I believe that it's in our interest and in the interest of Israel and Iran, and Saudi Arabia, for the United States to sell arms to those countries.",0,0,1,0,0,1
It's for their security as well as ours.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our relationship with the People's Republic of China is based upon the Shanghai Communique, of 1972, and that communique, calls for the normalization of relations between the United States and the People's Republic.",1,0,0,0,0,1
It doesn't set a times schedule.,0,0,1,0,0,1
It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the People's Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"The net result is this administration, and during my time as the president for the next four years, we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense, and we will insist that the disputes between Taiwan and the People's Republic be settled peacefully, as was agreed in the Shanghai Communique, of 1972.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Well, I'd like to go back just one moment to the previous question, where uh - Mr. Ford, I think, confused the issue by trying to say that we are shipping Israel 40 percent of our aid.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Also in 1975, we almost brought Israel to their knees after the uh - Yom Kippur War by the so-called reassessment of our relationship to Israel.",1,1,0,1,1,1
We in effect tried to make Israel the scapegoat for the problems in the Middle East.,1,0,1,0,0,0
And this weakened our relationships with Israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the Israelis.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"We opened a great opportunity in l972, which has pretty well been frittered - frit- frittered away under Mr. Ford, that ought to be a constant uh - inclination toward - uh - toward friendship.",0,1,0,1,0,1
But I would never let that friendship with the People's Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, always in the past we've had an ability to have a strong defense and also have - to have a strong uh - domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations.",0,0,0,0,0,1
These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.,0,1,1,0,1,1
We're no longer respected in a showdown vote in the United Nations or in - in any other international council we're lucky to get 20 percent of the other nations to vote with us.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Our allies feel that we've neglected them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The so-called Nixon shock against Japan had weakened our relationships there.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Under this administration we've also had an inclination to keep separate the European countries, thinking that if they are separate, then we can dominate them and proceed with our secret, Lone Ranger-type diplomatic efforts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The worst inflation since the Great Depression.,1,0,0,1,1,1
The highest unemployment of any developed nation of the world.,1,1,0,1,1,1
"We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany.",1,0,0,0,1,1
Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan.,1,1,1,0,1,1
And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So strong economy is very important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that's where our strength lies.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under this administration we've had a continuation of the so-called balance of power politics, where everything is looked on as a struggle between us on the one side, the Soviet Union on the other.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Our allies - the smaller countries get trampled in the rush.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon.",1,1,1,0,1,1
The unemployment rate was less than 4 percent.,1,0,0,0,0,1
The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.,1,1,1,0,1,1
"So we did have at that time with good management, the ability to do both.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think that anybody can say that Johnson and Kennedy neglected the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me say very categorically you cannot maintain the security of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated.,0,0,1,0,0,1
In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion.,1,0,1,0,0,1
He's now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars.,1,0,0,0,1,1
Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe.",1,0,0,0,0,1
In uh - November of 1975 I met with the leaders of the five industrial nations in France for the purpose of seeing what we could do acting together to meet the problems of uh - the coming recession.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Our relations with Japan have never been better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was the first United States president to visit Japan.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And we uh - had the emperor of Japan here this uh - past year and the net result is Japan and the United States are working more closely together now than at any time in the history of our relationship.,1,1,0,1,0,1
You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better.",1,0,0,0,0,0
First we have to understand that SALT I expires October third 1977.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Uh - Mr. Brezhnev and I met in Vladivostok in December of 1974 for the purpose of trying to take the initial step so we could have a SALT II agreement that would go to l985.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh - uh - launchers of ballistic missiles.",1,1,1,0,1,1
Uh - that would mean a cutback in the Soviet program; it would not interfere with our own program.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"At the same time, we put a limitation of thirteen hundred and twenty on MIRVs.",1,1,0,0,1,1
"Our technicians have been working since that time in Geneva, trying to put into technical language a - an agreement that can be verified by both parties.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels.",1,1,0,0,0,1
Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.,1,1,1,0,1,1
"But I can say that I am dedicated to proceeding, and I met just last week with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union, and he indicated to me that uh - the Soviet Union was interested in narrowing the differences and making a realistic and a sound compromise.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe, that the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because if we do not and SALT I expires on October three, 1977, you will unleash again an all-out nuclear arms race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimensions.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They are a new weapons system that has a great potential, both conventional and nuclear armed.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"At the same time, we have to make certain that the Soviet Union's Backfire, which they claim is not an intercontinental aircraft and which some of our people contend is, must also be included if we are to get the kind of agreement which is in the best interest of both countries.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And I really believe that it - it's far better for us and for the Soviet Union, and more importantly for the people around the world, that these two superpowers find an answer for a SALT II agreement before October three, 1977.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Mr. Ford acts like he's uh - running for president for the first time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He's been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"He has learned the date of the expiration of SALT I, apparently.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"We've seen, in this world, a development of a tremendous threat to us.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"As a nuclear engineer myself, I know the limitations and capabilities of atomic power.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I also - know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"Only the last few days with the election approaching, has Mr. Ford taken any interest in a nonproliferation movement.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives.",1,0,1,0,1,1
I've also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of - processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Mr. Ford hasn't moved on this.,1,0,1,0,0,1
We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Mr. Ford, again, under pressure from the atomic energy lobby, has insisted that this reprocessing or rather re-en- enrichment be done by private industry and not by the existing uh - government uh - plants.",1,1,1,0,0,1
This kind of confusion and absence of leadership has let us drift now for two years with a constantly increasing threat of atomic weapons throughout the world.,0,0,1,0,0,1
We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.,1,0,1,0,1,1
If we continue under Mr. Ford's policy by 1985 or '90 we'll have twenty nations that have the capability of exploding atomic weapons.,0,0,1,0,1,1
This has got to be stopped.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, it's not just campaign rhetoric.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I think we got to stay that way and continue to increase our capabilities to meet any potential threat.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles, as far as strength derived from the unity within our country, as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that we'll give them adequate attention, as far as - as strength derived from doing what's right - caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world - in those respects, we're not strong.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Also, we'll never be strong again overseas, unless we're strong at home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We've got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago.,1,0,1,0,1,1
We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office.,1,0,1,0,1,1
This kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And we not only have uh problems at home but we export those problems overseas.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Under this administration that strength has not been realized.,0,0,1,0,1,0
Governor Carter uh - brags about the unemployment during Democratic administrations and condemns the unemployment at the present time.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"I must remind him that we're at peace and during the period that he brags about unemployment being low, the United States was at war.",1,0,0,0,0,1
Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I have recommended to the Congress that we develop the uranium enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio, which is a publicly owned - U.S. government facility and have indicated that the private program which would follow on in Alabama is one that may or may not uhh - be constructed.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The governor also talks about morality in foreign policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"What is more moral than peace, and the United States is at peace today?",0,0,0,0,0,0
What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?,1,0,1,0,1,1
The Ford administration wants to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped countries throughout the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"What is more moral than for the United States under the Ford administration to take the lead in southern Africa, in the Middle East?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that uh - our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the initiatives that we took in southern Africa are the best examples of what this administration is doing and will continue to do in the next four years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And I believe that we used our skill.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secretary of State Kissinger has done a superb job in working with the black African nations, the so-called front-line nations.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Secretary Kissinger, in his meeting with uh - Prime Minister Smith of Rhodesia, was able to convince him that it was in the best interests of whites as well as blacks in Rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government.",1,1,0,0,0,1
"This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There've been more disputes in its area where there's more volatility than any other place in the world.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"But because Arab nations and the Israelis trust the United States, we were able to take the lead in the Sinai II Agreement.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we will do it with the highest moral principles.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another - and the United States must not spread itself too thinly - that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in Vietnam - but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Let me take uh - South Korea as an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have personally told President Pack that the United States does not condone the kind of repressive measures that he has taken in that country.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops - they are supported by the People's Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union.",1,0,0,0,0,1
South Korea faces a very delicate situation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now the United States, in this case, this administration, has recommended a year ago and we have reiterated it again this year, that the United States, South Korea, North Korea and the uh - People's Republic of China sit down at a conference table to resolve the problems of the Korean peninsula.",1,0,0,1,0,1
"This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I notice that Mr. Ford didn't comment on the uh - prisons in Chile.,0,1,1,0,0,1
"This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship.",1,0,1,0,1,1
This has not been an ancient history story.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Another point I wanna make is this.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He says we have to move from one area of the world to another.,1,0,0,0,0,1
That's one of the problems with this administration's so-called shuttle diplomacy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement.",0,0,1,0,0,1
We don't have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deals with world problems or even regional problems.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Karl Marx said that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they are at war or preparing far war.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I don't agree with that statement.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has put pressure on the Congress - and I don't believe Mr. Ford would even deny this - to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium.,1,0,1,0,1,1
And the last thing I wanna make is this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We were peaceful when Mr. Ford went into office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But he and Mr. Kissinger and others tried to start a new Vietnam in Angola, and it was only the outcry of the American people and the Congress when their secret deal was discovered that prevented our involvement in that conflagration which was taking place there.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Well, here again, uh - the Panamanian question is one that's been confused by Mr. Ford.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Uh - he had directed his uh - diplomatic relation - uh - uh - representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time.,1,1,1,1,0,1
"When Mr. Reagan raised this uh - question in Florida uh - Mr. Ford not only disavowed his instructions, but he also even dropped, parenthetically, the use of the word ""detente.""",1,1,1,1,1,1
"I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"When the original treaty was signed back in the early 1900s, when Theodore Roosevelt was president, Panama retained sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We retained control as though we had sovereignty.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I believe that we could share more fully responsibilities for the Panama Canal Zone with Panama.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of goods through the Panama Canal Zone.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future.",0,0,1,0,0,1
The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time.,1,0,0,0,0,1
I believe those negotiations should continue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there are certain guidelines that must be followed, and I've just defined them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me take just a minute to comment on something that Governor Carter said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"On non - nu- oh - uh - nonproliferation, in May of l975, I called for a conference of uh - nuclear suppliers.",0,1,0,1,0,1
That conference has met six times.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In May of this year, Governor Carter took the first initiative, approximately twelve months after I had taken my initiative a year ago.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.,1,0,1,1,0,1
"On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report.",1,0,0,0,0,1
I was very disappointed in the fact that the uh - GAO released that report because I think it interjected political partisan politics at the present time.,0,1,1,1,0,1
But let me comment on the report.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And let me make another observation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He was furious because he told me that it was the action of me, President Ford, that saved the lives of the crew of the Mayaguez.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving.",0,1,1,0,0,0
We did the right thing.,0,1,0,0,0,0
It seems to me that those who sit in Washington eighteen months after the incident are not the best judges of the decision-making process that had to be made by the National Security Council and by myself at the time the incident was developing in the Pacific.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the People's Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We made uh - diplomatic uh - protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations.,1,1,1,0,0,0
Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, I'm reluctant to uh comment on the recent report - I haven't read it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Mr. Ford has been there for eighteen months.,0,0,0,0,0,1
He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.,1,0,1,0,0,1
I understand that the report today is accurate.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Mr. Ford has said, I believe, that it was accurate, and that the White House made no attempt to block the issuing of that report.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I don't know if that's exactly accurate or not.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I understand that both the - the uh - Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of today's report, or yesterday's report, and also the National Security Agency.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"The only thing I believe is that whatever the - the knowledge was that Mr. Ford had should have been given to the American people eighteen months ago, immediately after the Mayaguez uh - incident occurred.",0,0,1,0,0,1
This is uh - what the American people want.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh - just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"But then after the immediate action is taken, I believe the president has an obligation to tell the American people the truth and not wait eighteen months later for the report to be issued.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company is an absolute disgrace.,0,0,1,0,1,1
This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights.,1,0,0,0,1,1
I'll do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a matter of morality.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I don't believe that Arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country, the commitment of our Constitution and Bill of Rights and protect people in this country who happen to be Jews.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing.,1,0,1,0,1,1

This isn't the beginning of the end of this crisis.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"But we're also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.,0,0,1,0,0,1
I -- I hope so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But there's also the issue of responsibility.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever.",1,0,0,0,1,1

Somehow we've lost that accountability.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"We've got to start also holding people accountable, and we've got to reward people who succeed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I promise you that that will happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, we've had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what's good for Wall Street, but not what's good for Main Street.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I do not think that they are.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The -- and I just fundamentally disagree.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We haven't been paying attention to them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you look at our tax policies, it's a classic example.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got fundamental problems in the system.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street.",1,0,1,0,0,0
So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job, that has brought on this crisis.",1,0,1,0,0,0

"Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's completely out of control.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And the -- the worst symptom on this disease is what my friend, Tom Coburn, calls earmarking as a gateway drug, because it's a gateway.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It's a gateway to out-of-control spending and corruption.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And we have former members of Congress now residing in federal prison because of the evils of this earmarking and pork-barrel spending.,1,0,1,0,1,0
"You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"I don't know if that was a criminal issue or a paternal issue, but the fact is that it was $3 million of our taxpayers' money.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And it has got to be brought under control.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As president of the United States, I want to assure you, I've got a pen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This one's kind of old.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will make them famous.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You will know their names.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, Senator Obama, you wanted to know one of the differences.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate.",1,0,0,1,1,1
"I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and they'll look at those projects.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"That kind of thing is not the way to rein in runaway spending in Washington, D.C. That's one of the fundamental differences that Senator Obama and I have.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, Senator McCain is absolutely right that the earmarks process has been abused, which is why I suspended any requests for my home state, whether it was for senior centers or what have you, until we cleaned it up.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And he's also right that oftentimes lobbyists and special interests are the ones that are introducing these kinds of requests, although that wasn't the case with me.",1,0,1,0,0,1
But let's be clear: Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And in his tax plan, you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"So my attitude is, we've got to grow the economy from the bottom up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And that means that the ordinary American out there who's collecting a paycheck every day, they've got a little extra money to be able to buy a computer for their kid, to fill up on this gas that is killing them.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And over time, that, I think, is going to be a better recipe for economic growth than the -- the policies of President Bush that John McCain wants to -- wants to follow.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, again, I don't mean to go back and forth, but he...",0,0,1,0,0,0
Senator Obama suspended those requests for pork-barrel projects after he was running for president of the United States.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"He didn't happen to see that light during the first three years as a member of the United States Senate, $932 million in requests.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"But the point is that -- you see, I hear this all the time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you know that it's tripled in the last five years?,1,0,0,0,0,1
"That's why we have, as I said, people under federal indictment and charges.",0,0,1,0,1,1
It's a system that's got to be cleaned up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have fought against it my career.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I have fought against it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee.",0,0,0,0,0,1

I want to cut spending.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to keep taxes low.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I -- I don't know where John is getting his figures.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"What I do is I close corporate loopholes, stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I think those are pretty important priorities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I pay for every dime of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's go back to the original point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"John, nobody is denying that $18 billion is important.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And, absolutely, we need earmark reform.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But the fact is that eliminating earmarks alone is not a recipe for how we're going to get the middle class back on track.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when you look at your tax policies that are directed primarily at those who are doing well, and you are neglecting people who are really struggling right now, I think that is a continuation of the last eight years, and we can't afford another four.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, if you're a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it's 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you're going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I want to cut that business tax.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, again, I want to return.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a lot more than $18 billion in pork-barrel spending.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"I can tell you, it's rife.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2,000 -- 2,000 -- look at them, my friends.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obama's definition of ""rich.""",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, let me just make a couple of points.",0,0,0,0,0,0
My definition -- here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more.",1,0,0,0,0,1
It's not like you want to close the loopholes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5,000 health credit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, what he doesn't tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"So you may end up getting a $5,000 tax credit.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It is not a good deal for the American people.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But it's an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off we're going to be.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, you know, let me just...",0,0,0,0,0,0
We had an energy bill before the United States Senate.,0,0,0,0,0,1

What he said was a precipitous...,0,0,1,0,0,0

We had the highest fatalities among U.S. troops this past year than at any time since 2002.,1,0,1,0,1,1

We do need tougher sanctions.,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is a mischaracterization of my position.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"And they showed solidarity with them, but, also, they are very concerned about the Russian threats to regain their status of the old Russian to regain their status of the old Russian empire.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, I think the Russians ought to understand that we will support -- we, the United States -- will support the inclusion of Georgia and Ukraine in the natural process, inclusion into NATO.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We also ought to make it very clear that the Russians are in violation of their cease-fire agreement.,0,0,1,0,0,1
They have stationed additional troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"By the way, I went there once, and we went inside and drove in, and there was a huge poster.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And this is -- this is Georgian territory.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And there was a huge poster of Vladimir Putin, and it said, ""Vladimir Putin, our president.""",0,0,0,0,1,0
"It was very clear, the Russian intentions towards Georgia.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They were just waiting to seize the opportunity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, this is a very difficult situation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We want to work with the Russians.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we also have every right to expect the Russians to behave in a fashion and keeping with a -- with a -- with a country who respects international boundaries and the norms of international behavior.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This whole thing has got a lot to do with Ukraine, Crimea, the base of the Russian fleet in Sevastopol.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And the breakdown of the political process in Ukraine between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko is a very serious problem.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"So watch Ukraine, and let's make sure that we -- that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, actually, I think Senator McCain and I agree for the most part on these issues.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Obviously, I disagree with this notion that somehow we did not forcefully object to Russians going into Georgia.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I immediately said that this was illegal and objectionable.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that's why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild.",1,1,0,0,1,1
Because part of Russia's intentions here was to weaken the economy to the point where President Saakashvili was so weakened that he might be replaced by somebody that Putin favored more.,1,0,1,0,0,1
Two points I think are important to think about when it comes to Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Number one is we have to have foresight and anticipate some of these problems.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That made no sense whatsoever.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Russia is in part resurgent and Putin is feeling powerful because of petro-dollars, as Senator McCain mentioned.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world's oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we've talked about, Iran, Venezuela.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.",1,0,1,0,0,1
So we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And so we -- we -- we've got to walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to energy independence, because this is probably going to be just as vital for our economy and the pain that people are feeling at the pump -- and, you know, winter's coming and home heating oil -- as it is our national security and the issue of climate change that's so important.",0,0,0,0,0,1
No one from Arizona is against solar.,1,0,1,0,1,0

"John, I'm sorry, but that's not true.",0,0,1,0,0,0
... it's hard to get there from here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I supported Nunn-Lugar back in the early 1990s when a lot of my colleagues didn't.,1,0,0,0,0,0
That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I -- I just have to correct the record here.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I have never said that I object to nuclear waste.,1,0,1,0,1,0
What I've said is that we have to store it safely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've got to make this point, Jim.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have voted for alternate fuel all of my time...,0,0,0,0,0,0
He -- he -- he objects...,0,0,0,0,0,0
No one can be opposed to alternate energy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've got one more energy -- you've got one more question.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I think it's much less than it was the day after 9/11.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think it -- that we have a safer nation, but we are a long way from safe.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And we were -- we were opposed by the administration, another area where I differed with this administration.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"And we were stymied until the families of 9/11 came, and they descended on Washington, and we got that legislation passed.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm happy to say that we've gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"I'm proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to do a better job in human intelligence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've got to -- to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don't ever torture a prisoner ever again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to make sure that our technological and intelligence capabilities are better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to work more closely with our allies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I know our allies, and I can work much more closely with them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I can tell you that I think America is safer today than it was on 9/11.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But that doesn't mean that we don't have a long way to go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'd like to remind you, also, as a result of those recommendations, we've probably had the largest reorganization of government since we established the Defense Department.",1,0,0,0,1,1
And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we still have a long way to go before we can declare America safe, and that means doing a better job along our borders, as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obviously, we've poured billions of dollars into airport security.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"We have done some work in terms of securing potential targets, but we still have a long way to go.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to make sure that we're hardening our chemical sites.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We haven't done enough in terms of transit; we haven't done enough in terms of ports.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the biggest threat that we face right now is not a nuclear missile coming over the skies.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This is why the issue of nuclear proliferation is so important.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It is the -- the biggest threat to the United States is a terrorist getting their hands on nuclear weapons.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And we -- we are spending billions of dollars on missile defense.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"And I actually believe that we need missile defense, because of Iran and North Korea and the potential for them to obtain or to launch nuclear weapons, but I also believe that, when we are only spending a few hundred million dollars on nuclear proliferation, then we're making a mistake.",1,0,1,0,0,1
They are now operating in 60 countries.,1,0,0,0,1,1
We can't simply be focused on Iraq.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to go to the root cause, and that is in Afghanistan and Pakistan.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's going to be critical.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to need more cooperation with our allies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And one last point I want to make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is important for us to understand that the way we are perceived in the world is going to make a difference, in terms of our capacity to get cooperation and root out terrorism.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And one of the things that I intend to do as president is to restore America's standing in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are less respected now than we were eight years ago or even four years ago.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And this is the greatest country on Earth.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But because of some of the mistakes that have been made -- and I give Senator McCain great credit on the torture issue, for having identified that as something that undermines our long-term security -- because of those things, we, I think, are going to have a lot of work to do in the next administration to restore that sense that America is that shining beacon on a hill.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"But in the case of missile defense, Senator Obama said it had to be, quote, ""proven.""",1,0,1,0,0,1
"That wasn't proven when Ronald Reagan said we would do SDI, which is missile defense.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And it was major -- a major factor in bringing about the end of the Cold War.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We seem to come full circle again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Obama still doesn't quite understand -- or doesn't get it -- that if we fail in Iraq, it encourages Al Qaida.",0,0,1,0,0,1
They would establish a base in Iraq.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we've made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"All of that would be lost if we followed Senator Obama's plan to have specific dates with withdrawal, regardless of conditions on the ground.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it's very fragile.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And we can't do what Senator Obama wants to do.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That is the central issue of our time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think Americans will judge very seriously as to whether that's the right path or the wrong path and who should be the next president of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, over the last eight years, this administration, along with Senator McCain, have been solely focused on Iraq.",1,0,0,0,0,1
That has been their priority.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That has been where all our resources have gone.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the meantime, bin Laden is still out there.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"In the meantime, we've got challenges, for example, with China, where we are borrowing billions of dollars.",1,0,1,0,0,1
They now hold a trillion dollars' worth of our debt.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"And they are active in countries like -- in regions like Latin America, and Asia, and Africa.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"They are -- the conspicuousness of their presence is only matched by our absence, because we've been focused on Iraq.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have weakened our capacity to project power around the world because we have viewed everything through this single lens, not to mention, look at our economy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We are now spending $10 billion or more every month.,1,0,0,0,1,1
And that means we can't provide health care to people who need it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We can't invest in science and technology, which will determine whether or not we are going to be competitive in the long term.",0,0,0,0,0,1
There has never been a country on Earth that saw its economy decline and yet maintained its military superiority.,1,0,0,0,1,1
So this is a national security issue.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We haven't adequately funded veterans' care.,1,0,0,0,0,0

"So we have put all chips in, right there, and nobody is talking about losing this war.",0,0,0,0,1,0
What we are talking about is recognizing that the next president has to have a broader strategic vision about all the challenges that we face.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's been missing over the last eight years.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"I've been involved, as I mentioned to you before, in virtually every major national security challenge we've faced in the last 20-some years.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"There are some advantages to experience, and knowledge, and judgment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as our other issues that he brought up are concerned, I know the veterans.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I've been proud of their support and their recognition of my service to the veterans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll take care of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they know that I'll take care of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Reform, prosperity, and peace, these are major challenges to the United States of America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm ready to go at it right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me just make a closing point.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, my father came from Kenya.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's where I get my name.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in the '60s, he wrote letter after letter to come to college here in the United States because the notion was that there was no other country on Earth where you could make it if you tried.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"I don't think any of us can say that our standing in the world now, the way children around the world look at the United States, is the same.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is something that I'm going to be committed to as president of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW-MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home.",1,0,0,0,0,1

"It's good to see you again, Senator Obama.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They're hurting, and they're angry.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they want this country to go in a new direction.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, we have allocated $750 billion.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That paid their mortgage payments?,0,0,1,0,0,0
It doesn't help that person in their home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We ought to put the homeowners first.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, let's focus on jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Number two, let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they're experiencing a crisis.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And we don't want to waste taxpayer money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to fix our health care system and we've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.,0,1,0,0,1,1
"You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Now Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's 16 million jobs in America.,1,1,0,0,1,1
And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business.,0,0,1,0,1,0
He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, ""Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then.""",0,0,0,0,0,1
And that requires us to make some important choices.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The last point I'll make about small businesses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They produce the most jobs.,1,1,0,0,1,1
"You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that we're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We're not going to do that in my administration.,0,0,1,0,0,0
If I can answer the question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We're talking about Joe the plumber.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"So, look, nobody likes taxes.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Let's not raise anybody's taxes.,0,0,1,0,0,0
The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.,1,0,0,0,1,1
Where are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business?,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to encourage business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, what I've done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I haven't made a promise about...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Every dollar that I've proposed, I've proposed an additional cut so that it matches.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And some of the cuts, just to give you an example, we spend $15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies.",1,0,0,0,1,1
It doesn't -- under the Medicare plan -- it doesn't help seniors get any better.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It's not improving our health care system.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don't work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Programs that we need, we should make them work better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, what is true is that Senator McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we make investments now so that people have coverage, that we are preventing diseases, that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future.",1,0,0,0,0,1

Some people say that's a hatchet.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"I have fought against -- well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation; Senator Obama supported those subsidies.,1,0,1,0,1,1

I know how to save billions.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Even FOX News disputes it, and that doesn't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people, on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities, you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, you've shown independence -- commendable independence, on some key issues like torture, for example, and I give you enormous credit for that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when it comes to economic policies, essentially what you're proposing is eight more years of the same thing.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And I think the American people understand it hasn't worked.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But it's very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I have disagreed with leaders of my own party.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I've got the scars to prove it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Whether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate for the first time.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Senator Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn't very convincing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, this has been a tough campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's been a very tough campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When Senator Obama was first asked, he said, ""Any place, any time,"" the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"One of them happened just the other day, when a man I admire and respect -- I've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis, an American hero, made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history, segregation, deaths of children in church bombings, George Wallace.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"That, to me, was so hurtful.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And, Senator Obama, you didn't repudiate those remarks.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"Every time there's been an out-of-bounds remark made by a Republican, no matter where they are, I have repudiated them.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.,1,0,1,0,1,1
And I can prove it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, Senator Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didn't keep your word.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And 100 percent, John, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"What the American people can't afford, though, is four more years of failed economic policies.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what's most pressing to them: the economic crisis.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is something that I would welcome.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it requires, I think, a recognition that politics as usual, as been practiced over the last several years, is not solving the big problems here in America.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, if you'll turn on the television, as I -- I watched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Every other ad -- ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan.,0,0,0,0,1,0
And any objective observer has said it's not true.,0,0,1,0,0,1
You're running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding for stem cell research.,1,0,1,0,0,1
You're running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"So the fact is that Senator Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics, going back to the beginning, amounts of money in negative attack ads on me.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And of course, I've been talking about the economy.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"I mean, look, if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis, who is an American hero, he, unprompted by my campaign, without my campaign's awareness, made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding, in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting, when my name came up, things like ""terrorist"" and ""kill him,"" and that you're running mate didn't mention, didn't stop, didn't say ""Hold on a second, that's kind of out of line.""",0,0,1,0,1,1
And I think Congressman Lewis' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Let me -- let me complete...,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And, in fact, afterwards, Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement, saying that he had probably gone over the line.",1,0,1,0,0,1

"We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we...",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, let me just say I would...",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people, you're going to have some fringe peoples.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But to somehow say that group of young women who said ""Military wives for McCain"" are somehow saying anything derogatory about you, but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say ""World War II, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq,"" I'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated, patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they're great citizens.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"In fact, some T-shirts that are very...",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So the point is -- the point is that I have repudiated every time someone's been out of line, whether they've been part of my campaign or not, and I will continue to do that.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, look, Bob, as I said...",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, here's what I would say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I suspect we won't agree here tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we're facing, if we're going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, if we can -- if we're going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in America, then Democrats, independents and Republicans, we're going to have to be able to work together.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it means that we can have tough, vigorous debates around issues.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What we can't do, I think, is try to characterize each other as bad people.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question.",0,0,0,0,0,0

This has been their primary focus.,1,0,0,0,0,0
So let's get the record straight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group.",1,0,1,0,0,0
I have roundly condemned those acts.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan's former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He has never been involved in this campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And he will not advise me in the White House.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Apparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names.",1,0,1,0,1,1
It had nothing to do with us.,1,0,0,0,0,0
The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"On economic policy, I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If I'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy, I associate myself with my running mate, Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar, the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or General Jim Jones, the former supreme allied commander of NATO.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Those are the people, Democrats and Republicans, who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, again, while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation, you and Mr. Ayers, together, you sent $230,000 to ACORN.",1,0,0,0,0,1
So -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers' living room.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's not the facts.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And it's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Senator Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more, and he had a long association with him.",1,0,1,0,0,1
It's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Senator Obama's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And my campaign is about getting this economy back on track, about creating jobs, about a brighter future for America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's what my campaign is about and I'm not going to raise taxes the way Senator Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's really what this campaign is going to be about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And Democrats and Republicans alike, I think, acknowledge his expertise there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it's also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from, coming from Scranton, fighting on behalf of working families, remembering what it's like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, as a consequence, his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what he's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"That's what he's done when it comes to, for example, passing the landmark 1994 crime bill, the Violence Against Women's Act.",1,0,0,0,1,0
"Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families, and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because after eight years of failed policies, he and I both agree that what we're going to have to do is to reprioritize, make sure that we're investing in the American people, give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations, but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now, make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence, something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years, and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden's always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin.",0,0,0,0,0,0

She's a reformer through and through.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's time we had that bresh of freth air (sic) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation's capital and sweep out the old-boy network and the cronyism that's been so much a part of it that I've fought against for all these years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, by the way, she also understands special-needs families.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"She understands that autism is on the rise, that we've got to find out what's causing it, and we've got to reach out to these families, and help them, and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children.",1,0,0,0,0,0
She understands that better than almost any American that I know.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I can't tell how proud I am of her and her family.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, I think it's -- that's going to be up to the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that, obviously, she's a capable politician who has, I think, excited the -- a base in the Republican Party.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's very commendable the work she's done on behalf of special needs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We're now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"There are several issues in which, frankly, Joe Biden and I openly and honestly disagreed on national security policy, and he's been wrong on a number of the major ones.",0,0,1,0,0,1

"Why can't we have transparency, accountability, reform of these agencies of government?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Maybe that's why he's asked for 860 -- sought and proposed $860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise people's taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the American families.,1,0,1,0,0,1

I think that's about a realistic timeframe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obviously, we've got an immediate crisis right now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia.,1,0,1,0,1,1
It's mortgaging our children's future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, from the start of this campaign, I've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, we do need to expand domestic production and that means, for example, telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they're not drilling, use them or lose them.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why I've focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate, and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that's built not in Japan and not in South Korea, but built here in the United States of America.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Now I just want to make one last point because Senator McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue.,1,0,0,0,0,1
I believe in free trade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And NAFTA doesn't have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.,1,0,1,0,1,1
And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper.,0,0,1,0,0,1
That is not free trade.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And you really have to pay attention to words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said, we will look at offshore drilling.",1,0,0,0,0,0
We can offshore drill now.,1,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to do it now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own.,0,0,0,0,0,1

I am a free trader.,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free.",1,0,0,0,0,1
The same country that's helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that's killing young Americans.,1,0,1,0,0,0
And also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay the billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that we've already paid.,0,0,0,0,1,1
Free trade with Colombia is something that's a no-brainer.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Actually, I understand it pretty well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"And what I have said, because the free trade -- the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections, but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence isn't being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights, which is why, for example, I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well-structured agreement.",1,0,0,0,0,1
But I think that the important point is we've got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And the last point I'll make, because we started on energy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done.,0,0,1,0,1,0
It's going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"If we can get that right, then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence, but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America, including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel-efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels, the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, let me just said that that this is -- he -- Senator Obama doesn't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez, the guy who has been helping FARC, the terrorist organization.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets.",1,0,0,0,1,1
So I don't -- I don't think there's any doubt that Senator Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression.",1,0,0,0,1,1

"If you don't have health insurance, then what we're going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees, which will give you high-quality care, choice of doctors, at lower costs, because so many people are part of this insured group.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We'll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses, like diabetes and heart disease, that cost a huge amount, but could be prevented.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it's also how we're going to save the federal budget, because we can't afford these escalating costs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"They're seeing their premiums, their co-pays go up.",1,1,0,0,1,1
Forty-seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"And it really is the cost, the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That will -- that will reduce costs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to have more community health centers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to have walk-in clinics.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Every parent should know what's going on there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We -- we need to have -- we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to give every American family a $5,000 refundable tax credit.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Senator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through -- as he said, his object is a single payer system.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"If you like that, you'll love Canada and England.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is not and I just described it...,0,0,1,0,0,0
I just described what my plan is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'm happy to talk to you, Joe, too, if you're out there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's your fine -- zero.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You won't pay a fine, because...",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Zero, because as I said in our last debate and I'll repeat, John, I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees, but are not doing it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"But large businesses that can afford it, we've got a choice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they're going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums.",1,0,1,0,0,1
The average family is paying an additional $900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured.,1,1,0,0,0,1
"In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"He says he's going to give you all a $5,000 tax credit.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And you can go out and buy your own insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Here's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Older folks, less healthy folks, what's going to end up happening is that you're going to be the only ones left in your employer-based system, your employers won't be able to afford it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And once you're out on your own with this $5,000 credit, Senator McCain, for the first time, is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer.",1,0,0,0,0,1

"So if you've got $5,000 and it's going to cost you $12,000, that's a loss for you.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Last point about Senator McCain's plan is that insurers right now, the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and, under Senator McCain's plan, those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry-picking and excluding people from coverage.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"That, I think, is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hey, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that he's been working for 10-12 hours a day, seven days a week, and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth, but -- in other words, take Joe's money and then you decide what to do with it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you.",1,0,0,0,0,1
That's big government at its best.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits, which may be taxed, which will be taxed, but then you add $5,000 onto it, except for those people who have the gold-plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things.",0,0,0,0,1,1

That's the choice you'll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally doesn't support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.",1,0,0,0,0,1
I would never and have never in all the years I've been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court.,1,0,1,0,1,1
I thought it was a bad decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up.",1,0,1,0,0,1

That's not the way we should judge these nominees.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They should be judged on their qualifications.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will find the best people in the world -- in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And not legislating from the bench.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision.",0,0,0,0,0,0

So this is going to be an important issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll just give you one quick example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job.",1,0,1,0,1,1

We tried to overturn it in the Senate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that it's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the kind of judge that I want.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obviously, that law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years.",1,0,1,0,1,1
It was a trial lawyer's dream.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Health-care costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decision-making process.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Most health-care costs are covered by third parties.,1,0,0,0,0,1

It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance.,1,0,0,0,1,1

The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets - the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets - for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958.,1,0,1,0,0,1
We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.,1,0,0,0,0,1
The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident.,1,0,1,0,0,1
The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956.,1,0,1,0,0,1

I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"First of all, he's wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets.",0,0,1,0,0,0
He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn't the reason that he broke up the conference.,1,0,0,0,1,1

The United States is a strong country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Whenever we do anything that's wrong, we can express regrets.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference - or immediately before the summit conference occurred.",1,0,1,0,0,1
This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We all remember Pearl Harbor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We lost three thousand American lives.,1,0,1,0,1,1
We cannot afford an intelligence gap.,0,0,1,0,0,0

My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"From the standpoint of MR, KENNEDY: Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, as a legislative leader.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as I just said that I believe that the passage of the so-called Title Three, which gives the Attorney General the power to protect Constitutional rights in those cases where it's not possible for the person involved to bring the suit.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Secondly, as an executive leader.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.,1,0,1,0,0,1
The right to vote is basic.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"Thirdly, I don't believe that the government contracts division is operated with vigor.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And that's in all sections of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And then fourthly, as a moral leader.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There is a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We are in a very difficult time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need all the talent we can get.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We sit on a conspicuous stage.,0,0,0,0,0,0

But it wou- uh - evidently uh - under the handling of the case it was not.,0,1,1,0,0,0
I would hope an incident like that would not happen.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned - with deliberate speed - then in my judgment, providing he's behind action, I believe we can make uh - progress.",0,1,0,0,0,0
Now the present Administration - the President - has said - never indicated what he thought of the 1954 decision.,1,1,1,0,0,1
"Unless the president speaks, then of course uh - the country doesn't speak, and Franklin Roosevelt said: ""The pre - uh - the presidency of the United States is above all a place of moral leadership.""",0,1,0,1,0,1
And I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's look at the performance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time.",1,0,0,0,0,1
I selected a man who stands with me in this field and who will talk with me and work with me on it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now the Senator referred to the Committee on Government Contracts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it.",1,0,1,0,1,1
All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What we need is action.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that will always be the case as long as the Communists are on the international scene, in the aggressive tac- uh - tendencies that they presently are following.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it's time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"First of all, we hear that our prestige is at an all-time low.",0,0,0,1,1,1
Senator Kennedy has been hitting that point over and over again.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I would suggest that after Premier Kush- Khrushchev's uh - performance in the United Nations, compared with President Eisenhower's eloquent speech, that at the present time Communist prestige in the world is at an all-time low and American prestige is at an all-time high.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now that, of course, is just one factor, but it's a significant one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we look, for example, at the vote on the Congo.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We were on one side; they were on the other side.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's a test of prestige.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained.",1,0,0,0,0,0
In this cold war we have to recognize where it is being fought and then we have to develop programs to deal with it.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It's being fought primarily in Asia, in Africa, and in Latin America.",1,0,0,0,0,1
What tools do we need to fight us?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Now Senator Kennedy a moment ago referred to the fact that there was not an adequate Voice of America program for Latin America.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs.",1,0,0,0,1,1
They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years.,1,1,0,0,1,1
They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.,1,1,1,0,1,1
"Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Of course Mr. Nixon is wholly inaccurate when he says that the Congress has not provided more funds in fact than the President recommended for national defense.,1,0,1,0,1,1
Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.,1,1,1,0,1,1
I was responsible for the amendment with Senator Monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground forces.,1,0,0,0,0,1
The Congress of the United States appropriated six hundred and seventy-seven million dollars mare than the President was willing to use up till a week ago.,1,0,0,1,1,1
"Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We all know about the vote held this week - of the five neutralists - and it was generally regarded as a defeat for the United States.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations.",1,0,0,0,1,1
Last year there were twenty-nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote is held you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it.,1,0,0,0,0,1
We have not maintained our position and our prestige.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970.",1,1,1,0,0,1
Governor Rockefeller has been far more critical in June of our position in the world than I have been.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We have been wholly indifferent to Latin America until the last few months.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The program that was put forward this summer, after we broke off the sugar quota with Cuba, really was done because we wanted to get through the O.A.S.",1,0,0,0,0,0
meeting a condemnation of Russian infiltration of Cuba.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency.",0,0,0,0,0,1
This permits them to maintain their self-respect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And Senator Fulbright, Senator Humphrey and I tried to do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And unless we're ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I think the United States can afford to do these things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that we could not afford not to do these things.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This goes to our survival.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I believe we can do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we build our economy the way we should, we can afford to do these things and we must do it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Kennedy has put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to step up exchange; we need to step up technical assistance so that trained people in these newly developing countries can operate the economies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,1
This we must get across to the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we can't do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance.",0,0,1,0,0,1
The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We must stand for our ideals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now in the last Congress - the special session of the Congress - there was a bill: one by the President, one by Senator Kennedy and members of his party.",1,0,0,0,1,1
Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.,1,0,0,0,0,1
On the other hand we found that the bill got into the legislative difficulties and consequently no action was taken.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have made recommendations on that and I have discussed them previously and I will spell them out further in the campaign.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education.",1,1,1,0,0,1
It also exists among minority groups.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why I have a program for education, a program in the case of equal job opportunities, and one that would also deal with our older citizens.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now finally, with regard to the whole problem of combating recession, as you call it, we must use the full resources of the government in these respects: one, we must see to it that credit is expanded as we go into any recessionary period - and understand, I do not believe we're going into a recession.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I believe this economy is sound and that we're going to move up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy.",0,1,0,0,0,1
This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I do not expect it to come.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm very familiar with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It came out of the committee of which I was the chairman - the labor subcommittee - in fifty-five.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times.",1,0,0,0,1,1
We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Let me make it very clear that the bill that Mr. Nixon talked about did not mention Wilkes-Barre or Scranton; it did not mention West Virginia.,1,0,1,0,1,1
Our bill was far more effective.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The bill introduced and erd- sponsored by Senator Douglas was far more effective in trying to stimulate the economy of those areas.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Secondly, he has mentioned the problem of our older citizens.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.,1,0,1,0,0,1
Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,1
One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The other would be to make a judgment on what's the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well I understood that this was the Eisenhower-Nixon Administration according to all the Republican uh - propaganda that I've read.,1,0,1,0,1,1
The question is what we're going to do in the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've been critical of this Administration and I've been critical of the President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.,0,0,1,0,0,1
I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now that's an issue between Mr. Nixon and myself.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I believe the American people have to make the choice on November eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead faster, whether what we're doing now is not satisfactory, whether we have to build greater strength at home and abroad and Mr. Nixon's view.",0,0,0,0,0,0
President Eisenhower moves from the scene on January twentieth and the next four years are the critical years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If our view prevails that we have to do more, that we have to make a greater national and international effort, that we have lost prestige in Latin America - the President of Brazil - the new incumbent running for office called on Castro during his campaign because he thought it was important to get the vote of those who were supporting Castro in Latin America.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"In Africa, the United States has ignored Latin uh - Africa.",0,1,1,1,1,1
We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.,1,0,0,1,0,1
Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything.,1,0,0,0,0,1
We've been uh - having a very clear decision in the last eight years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Nixon has been part of that Administration.,1,0,0,0,0,0
He's had experience in it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I believe this Administration has not met its responsibilities in the last eight years, that our power relative to that of the Communists is declining, that we're facing a very hazardous time in the sixties, and unless the United States begin to move here - unless we start to go ahead - I don't believe that we're going to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me make my position cl ear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have participated in the discussions leading to the decisions in this Administration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm proud of the record of this Administration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now looking at Senator Kennedy's credentials: he is suggesting that he will move America faster and further than I will.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But what does he offer?,0,0,0,0,0,0
He offers retreads of programs that failed.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"And when we compare the economic progress of this country in the Truman Administration with that of the Eisenhower Administration, we find that in every index there has been a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this Administration than in that one.",1,1,0,1,1,1
I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"No, of course I haven't talked to Prime Minister Macmillan.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It would not be appropriate for me to do so.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There, Mr. Khrushchev came to that conference determined to break it up.",1,0,0,0,0,0
He was going to break it up because he would - knew that he wasn't going to get his way on Berlin and on the other key matters with which he was concerned at the Paris Conference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, if we're going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level - the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level - prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev - after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations - gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It - my view is the same as his.,0,1,0,1,0,0
Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now the next president of the United States in his first year is going to be confronted with a very serious question on our defense of Berlin, our commitment to Berlin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to be a test of our nerve and will.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to be a test of our strength.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I'm talking about a national mood.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We don't know what the future's going to bring.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I would not want anyone to elect me uh - president of the United States - or vote for me - under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"If we're moving ahead, if we're providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country's on the move, then we're stronger, then we set a better example to the world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home.",0,1,1,0,0,0
So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're not able to consume what we're able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life.",0,1,0,0,0,0
I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less.",0,0,0,0,0,1
In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0

It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we're presently spending.,1,1,1,0,0,1
Now the Republican platform will cost more too.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is a question of which administration does the right thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"The final point that I would like to make is this: Senator Kennedy has suggested in his speeches that we lack compassion for the poor, for the old, and for others that are unfortunate.",1,0,1,0,0,0
Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know what it means to be poor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I've been there now for fourteen years, the same period of time that he has, so that our experience in uh - government is comparable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I come out of the Democratic party, which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and which supported and sustained these programs which I've discussed tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He was nominated by it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources.",1,0,1,0,1,1
I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope he would grant me the same.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The question before us is: which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, after each of my foreign trips I have made recommendations that have been adopted.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"After my trip to South America, I made recommendations that a separate inter-American lending agency be set up which the South American nations would like much better than a lend- than to participate in the lending agencies which treated all the countries of the world the same.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Within the Administration, as a chairman of the President's Committee on Price Stability and Economic Growth, I have had the opportunity to make recommendations which have been adopted within the Administration and which I think have been reasonably effective.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I know Senator Kennedy suggested in his speech at Cleveland yesterday that that committee had not been particularly effective.,1,0,1,0,0,1
I would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it - I would not presume to - that since that committee has been formed the price line has been held very well within the United States.,1,1,0,1,0,1
"Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years.",0,1,0,1,0,1
I prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty years of the Democrats and the eight years of the Republicans to show an overall period of growth.,0,0,0,0,0,1
In regard to uh - price stability uh - I'm not aware that that committee did produce recommendations that ever were certainly before the Congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to controlling prices.,1,1,1,0,0,1
"In regard to the exchange of students and labor unions, I am chairman of the subcommittee on Africa and I think that one of the most unfortunate phases of our policy towards that country was the very minute number of exchanges that we had.",1,0,0,0,0,1
I think it's true of Latin America also.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos.",0,1,1,0,0,1
The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.,0,0,0,0,0,1
There are hundreds of thousands of them.,0,0,0,0,1,1
They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"They bring their crops in or their livestock in, many of them about the same time.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.,0,0,1,0,1,1
I think the experience of the twenties has shown what a free market could do to agriculture.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse.",0,0,1,0,0,1
The farmers are the number one market for the automobile industry of the United States.,1,1,0,1,0,1
The automobile industry is the number one market for steel.,1,1,0,0,0,1
"So if the farmers' economy continues to decline as sharply as it has in recent years, then I think you would have a recession in the rest of the country.",0,0,1,0,0,1
So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Secondly, my objection to present farm policy is that there are no effective controls to bring supply and demand into better balance.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth.",1,1,1,1,1,1
We've had a uh - higher tax load from the Treasury for the farmer in the last few years with the lowest farm income in many years.,1,1,1,1,1,1
I think that this farm policy has failed.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And that can only be done through governmental action.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I therefore suggest that in those basic commodities which are supported, that the federal government, after endorsement by the farmers in that commodity, attempt to bring supply and demand into balance - attempt effective production controls - so that we won't have that five or six per cent surplus which breaks the price fifteen or twenty per cent.",1,1,0,0,0,1
I think Mr. Benson's program has failed.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I must say, after reading the Vice President's speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don't believe that it's very much different from Mr. Benson's.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think it provides effective governmental controls.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think the support prices are tied to the average market price of the last three years, which was Mr. Benson's theory.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He has made the suggestion that what we need is to move in the direction of more government controls, a suggestion that would also mean raising prices uh - that the consumers pay for products and im- and imposing upon the farmers uh - controls on acreage even far more than they have today.",0,1,1,0,1,1
I think this is the wrong direction.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The program that I have advocated is one which departs from the present program that we have in this respect.,1,0,0,0,0,1
It recognizes that the government has a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently is in because the government got him into it.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The farmer produced these surpluses because the government asked him to through legislation during the war.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Until we get the surpluses off the farmer's back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected.",0,1,1,1,0,1
The President has always maintained and very properly so that he is entitled to get what advice he wants from his cabinet and from his other advisers without disclosing that to anybody - including as a matter of fact the Congress.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, I can only say this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have been in the cabinet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have met with the legislative leaders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have met with the President when he made the great decisions with regard to Lebanon, Quemoy and Matsu, other matters.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The President has asked for my advice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sometimes my advice has been taken.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do not say that I have made the decisions.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions.",0,0,1,0,0,0
All that his advisers do is to give counsel when he asks for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year.",0,0,0,0,0,1
His experience has been different from mine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mine has been in the executive branch.,0,0,0,0,1,1
His has been in the legislative branch.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Abraham Lincoln came to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little known uh - session in the House of Representatives and after being defeated for the Senate in fifty-eight and was a distinguished president.,1,1,0,0,1,1
There's no certain road to the presidency.,0,0,1,0,0,0
There are no guarantees that uh - if you take uh - one road or another that you will be a successful president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have been in the Congress for fourteen years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have voted in the last uh - eight years uh - and the Vice President was uh - presiding over the Senate and meeting his other responsibilities.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I have met met uh - decisions over eight hundred times on matters which affect not only the domestic security of the United States, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",0,1,0,0,0,1
The question really is: which candidate and which party can meet the problems that the United States is going to face in the sixties?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I did not advocate reducing the federal debt because I don't believe that you're going to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty-one, two, or three.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Not reducing the interest -,0,1,0,0,0,0
- reducing the interest rate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Vice President and I disagree on this.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I think that's a good investment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we're going to have to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated.",0,0,1,0,0,1
There is no greater return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I believe in the balanced budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Otherwise, with a steady rate of economic growth - and Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller, in their meeting, said a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollars extra in tax revenues.",1,1,0,0,0,1
"Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think what Mr. Novins was referring to was not one of Senator Kennedy's speeches, but the Democratic platform, which did mention cutting the national debt.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"I think, too, that it should be pointed out that of course it is not possible, particularly under the proposals that Senator Kennedy has advocated, either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxes.",0,0,1,0,0,1
As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,1
As Senator Kennedy points out that as far as his one proposal is concerned - the one for medical care for the aged - that that would be financed out of Social Security.,1,1,0,0,0,1
"That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security.",0,0,1,0,0,1
He points out that he would make pay-as-you-go be the basis for our natural resources development.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Where our natural resources development - which I also support, incidentally, however - whenever you uh - uh - in - in - uh - appropriates money for one of these projects, you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out, it doesn't mean that you - the government doesn't have to put out the money this year.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we've been talking about.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I favor that because I believe that's the best way to aid our schools without running any risk whatever of the federal government telling our teachers what to teach.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Why do I take it now?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We both took it then, and I take it now, for this reason: we want higher teachers' salaries.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We need higher teachers' salaries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we also want our education to be free of federal control.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.,0,0,1,0,0,0
There is another point that should be made.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I favor higher salaries for teachers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, as Senator Kennedy said in January of this year in this same press conference, the way that you get higher salaries for teachers is to support school construction, which means that all of the local school districts in the various states then have money which is freed to raise the standards for teachers' salaries.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"I should also point out this; once you put the responsibility on the federal government for paying a portion of teachers' salaries, your local communities and your states are not going to meet the responsibility as much as they should.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.,1,0,0,0,1,1
This is not enough; it should be more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"My objection here is the potential cost in controls and eventual freedom for the American people by giving the federal government power over education, and that is the greatest power a government can have.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"When uh - the Vice President quotes me in January, sixty, I do not believe the federal government should pay directly teachers' salaries, but that was not the issue before the Senate in February.",1,1,1,1,0,1
The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.,0,0,1,0,0,1
The state then could determine whether the money would be spent for school construction or teacher salaries.,0,0,0,0,0,1
On that question the Vice President and I disagreed.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal.",1,1,1,1,1,1
I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee.",0,1,0,0,0,1
And therefore I think that was a sound proposal and that is why I supported it and I regret that it did not pass.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, there have been statements made that uh - the Democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that I am in favor of unbalancing the budget.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars.",1,1,1,0,1,1
That is not my view and I think it ought to be stated very clearly on the record.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well as you take the bills -,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I may take the bills, we did pass in the Senate a bill uh - to provide a dollar twenty-five cent minimum wage.",1,0,1,0,0,1
It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.,1,0,1,0,1,1
We were threatened by a veto if we passed a dollar and a quarter - it's extremely difficult with the great power that the president does to pass any bill when the president is opposed to it.,1,1,1,0,0,1
All the president needs to sustain his veto of any bill is one-third plus one in either the House or the Senate.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate.",1,0,0,0,0,1
It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.,1,0,1,0,0,0
It was killed in the Rules Committee.,1,0,1,0,1,0
And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.,1,0,1,0,1,1
Four Democrats voted for it.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Thirdly, on medical care for the aged, this is the same fight that's been going on for twenty-five years in Social Security.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We wanted to tie it to Social Security.,1,0,0,0,0,0
We offered an amendment to do so.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But if you send a Republican president and a Democratic majority and the threat of a veto hangs over the Congress, in my judgment you will continue what happened in the August session, which is a clash of parties and inaction.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Well obviously my views are a little different.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I don't see how it's possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans.",1,0,1,0,0,1
It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I would say further that to blame the President in his veto power for the inability of the Senator and his colleagues to get action in this special session uh - misses the mark.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress.",0,0,0,0,0,0
If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?,0,0,1,0,0,0
The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.,0,0,1,0,1,1
It was because they were too extreme.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"I would say this; that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"We cannot, of course, control the Senate.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Whenever a majority of the people are for a program, the House and the Senate responds to it.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And whether this House and Senate, in the next session is Democratic or Republican, if the country will have voted for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposals that he has made, I believe that you will find that the president, if it were a Republican, as it would be in my case, would be able to get his program through that Congress.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs.",0,0,1,0,0,0
You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the reason President Eisenhower's vetoes have been sustained - the reason the Congress does not send up bills to him which they think will be vetoed - is because the people and the Congress, the majority of them, know the country is behind the President.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Well, now let's look at these bills that the Vice President suggests were too extreme.",0,0,1,0,0,0
One was a bill for a dollar twenty-five cents an hour for anyone who works in a store or company that has a million dollars a year business.,1,0,1,0,0,1
I don't think that's extreme at all; and yet nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against that proposal.,1,0,1,0,0,1
Secondly was the federal aid to education bill.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it.",1,1,1,0,0,1
I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I do say a majority are.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And I say a majority of the Republicans are opposed to it.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"The third is medical care for the aged which is tied to Social Security, which is financed out of Social Security funds.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It does not put a deficit on the Treasury.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security.",1,1,1,0,1,1
So these are three programs which are quite moderate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it shows the difference between the two parties.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One party is ready to move in these programs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The other party gives them lip service.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, I think they're serious.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The major threat is external and will continue.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The question of Communism within the United States has been one that has worried us in the past.,0,0,1,0,0,1
It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to remember that the cold war that Mr. Khrushchev is waging and his colleagues are waging, is waged all over the world and it's waged right here in the United States.",0,0,1,0,1,1
It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We uphold the standards of conduct which they would never follow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, in this connection, I think that uh - we must look to the future having in mind the fact that we fight Communism at home not only by our laws to deal with Communists uh - the few who do become Communists and the few who do become tra- fellow travelers, but we also fight Communism at home by moving against those various injustices which exist in our society which the Communists feed upon.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his.",0,0,1,0,0,0
The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.,0,0,0,0,0,0
As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The test of whether America moves is whether the federal government, plus the state government, plus the local government, plus the biggest segment of all - individual enterprise - moves.",0,1,0,0,0,1
We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.,1,1,0,0,1,1
Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do.",1,0,1,0,0,1
That is the growth that we are looking for; it is the growth that this Administration has supported and that its policies have stimulated.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"Secondly, I think we have a rich uh - country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we have a powerful country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Soviet Union is making great gains.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"It isn't enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"First of all, I think it is well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the Soviet Union in this whole matter of growth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Soviet Union has been moving faster than we have.,1,0,0,0,0,1
But the reason for that is obvious.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They start from a much lower base.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product.",1,0,1,0,1,1
That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago.",1,0,0,0,0,1
Is this any reason for complacency?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not at all Because these are determined men.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated.",0,0,0,0,0,1
There are many of the points that he has made that I would like to comment upon.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The one in the field of health is worth mentioning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our health program - the one that Senator Javits and other Republican Senators, as well as I supported - is one that provides for all people over sixty-five who want health insurance, the opportunity to have it if they want it.",1,0,0,0,0,1
It provides a choice of having either government insurance or private insurance.,1,0,0,0,0,1
But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"His program under Social Security, would require everybody who had Social Security to take government health insurance whether he wanted it or not.",1,0,0,0,1,1
And it would not cover several million people who are not covered by Social Security at all.,1,0,1,0,0,1
Here is one place where I think that our program does a better job than his.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.,1,1,1,0,1,1
We found the people who could least afford it - people on retired incomes uh - people on fixed incomes - we found them unable to meet their bills at the end of the month.,1,1,0,0,0,1
It is essential that a man who's president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.,1,0,1,0,0,1
I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Secondly, the Vice President mentioned medical care for the aged.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our program was an amendment to the Kerr bill.,0,0,0,0,1,1
I think it's a very clear contrast.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it.",1,0,0,0,1,1
Mr. Landon ran in 1936 to repeal it.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The means are at question.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"If you feel that everything that is being done now is satisfactory, that the relative power and prestige and strength of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists; that we've b- gaining more security, that we are achieving everything as a nation that we should achieve, that we are achieving a better life for our citizens and greater strength, then I agree.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if you feel that we have to move again in the sixties, that the function of the president is to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as Franklin Roosevelt did in the thirties, the agenda for our people - what we must do as a society to meet our needs in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?",0,0,1,0,0,0
And if we meet our responsibilities I think freedom will conquer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we're ready to move.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it is to that great task, if we're successful, that we will address ourselves.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I.",0,0,1,0,0,1
The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry.",1,0,0,0,0,1
I think we've got to have fiscal restraint.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"That we ought to ... in addition to that, we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year, and save $750 billion.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"fiscal restraint, I think is necessary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you're causing inflation.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And it isn't really higher prices, it's just, you are reducing the value of the money.",0,0,1,0,0,1
You are robbing the American people of their savings.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"And so, the plan that I have proposed - and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology - all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations - produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year.",1,0,0,0,1,1

"Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that.",0,0,0,0,1,1
those imports have been reduced.,1,0,1,0,1,1

"Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then we're asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers.",0,0,1,0,0,1

I can't find a job.,0,1,0,0,1,0
I've got three part- time jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I can't begin to pay back my student loans.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
So what we have to do is two things.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"We're also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"And what's happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for America's young people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want you to be able to get a job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With half of college kids graduating this year without a college -- excuse me, without a job.",1,0,0,0,0,1

So more debt and less jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know what it takes to create good jobs again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"When you come out in 2014, I presume I'm going to be president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to make sure you get a job.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ones that can support a family.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt.,0,0,1,0,0,1
I said we're going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry and it's come surging back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit, but all across the country and that means we change our tax code so we're giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It also means we're helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Number two, we've got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the fact that you're going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we've worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Number three, we've got to control our own energy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we've been investing in; but also, we've got to make sure we're building the energy source of the future, not just thinking about next year, but ten years from now, 20 years from now.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"That's why we've invested in solar and wind and biofuels, energy efficient cars.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We've got to reduce our deficit, but we've got to do it in a balanced way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And let's take the money that we've been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges schools.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America's future is going to bright as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The president's policies have been exercised over the last four years and they haven't put Americans back to work.,1,0,0,0,1,1
We have fewer people working today than we had when the president took office.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"If the -- the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office, it's 7.8 percent now.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay.,1,0,0,0,1,1
It's going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And one thing that the president said, which I want to make sure that we understand, he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt.",1,0,1,0,1,0
My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macy's and Condell (ph) Airlines and come out stronger.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt.",1,0,1,0,1,1
You took General Motors bankrupt.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did.",0,0,1,1,0,0
"And I think it's important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn't true.",0,0,1,0,0,0
He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open.,0,0,1,0,1,0
And we would have lost a million jobs.,1,1,1,0,1,0
"And that -- don't take my word for it, take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney.",0,0,1,0,0,1
But they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And Governor Romney's says he's got a five-point plan?,0,0,1,0,1,0
Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan.,0,0,1,0,1,1
He has a one-point plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's been his philosophy in the private sector, that's been his philosophy as governor, that's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less.,1,0,0,0,0,1
You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions, and you still make money.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That's exactly the philosophy that we've seen in place for the last decade.,1,0,0,0,0,0
That's what's been squeezing middle class families.,1,0,1,0,0,0
And we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That -- that Detroit -- that Detroit answer...,0,0,1,0,0,0
"... and the rest of the answer, way off the mark.",0,0,1,0,0,0
The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So here's what I've done since I've been president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment.,1,0,0,0,0,1
But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional source of energy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy, you're going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas.",1,0,0,0,0,1
That's why we doubled clean -- clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, I want to build on that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, Governor Romney will say he's got an all-of-the-above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we're not going to control our own economic future.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Because China, Germany, they're making these investments.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And I'm not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's going to help Jeremy get a job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's also going to make sure that you're not paying as much for gas.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let's look at the president's policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we've had four years of policies being played out.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And the president's right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.",1,1,1,0,1,1
Well a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota.,1,0,0,0,0,1
What was his participation there?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The administration brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil, this massive new resource we have.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And what was the cost?,0,0,0,0,0,0
20 or 25 birds were killed and brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But what we don't need is to have the president keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"This has not been Mr. Oil, or Mr. Gas, or Mr. Coal.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Talk to the people that are working in those industries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"People grabbed my arms and said, ""Please save my job.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The head of the EPA said, ""You can't build a coal plant.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"You'll virtually -- it's virtually impossible given our regulations.""",0,0,1,0,0,0
"When the president ran for office, he said if you build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you'll go bankrupt.",1,1,1,0,1,1
That's not the right course for America.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Let's take advantage of the energy resources we have, as well as the energy sources for the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years, you're going to see manufacturing jobs come back.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"I'll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How in the world the president said no to that pipeline?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America, and that's what I'm going to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Candy, there's no doubt that world demand's gone up, but our production is going up, and we're using oil more efficiently.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We've opened up public lands.,1,0,0,0,1,1
We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my -- the previous president was an oil man.,1,0,1,0,0,1
And natural gas isn't just appearing magically.,0,0,1,0,0,1
We're encouraging it and working with the industry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when I hear Governor Romney say he's a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when -- Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ""This plant kills,"" and took great pride in shutting it down.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And now suddenly you're a big champion of coal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So what I've tried to do is be consistent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean coal technology, to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas.",1,0,0,0,0,0
And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"Oil production is up, natural gas production is up, and, most importantly, we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"That means those cars can be exported, 'cause that's the demand around the world, and it also means that it'll save money in your pocketbook.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"That's the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's what we're going to do in the next four years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that's not what you've done in the last four years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half.",1,0,0,0,1,1
So how much did you cut (inaudible)?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"How much did you cut them by, then?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor, we have actually produced more oil --",1,0,0,0,0,1
How much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters?,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Governor Romney, here's what we did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There were a whole bunch of oil companies.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"No, no, I had a question and the question was how much did you cut them by?",0,0,0,0,0,0
You want me to answer a question --,0,0,0,0,0,0
You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren't using.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"So what we said was you can't just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when it's most profitable for you.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And so what we did was take away those leases.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we are now reletting them so that we can actually make a profit.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And production on private -- on government land --,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Look, there's no question but the people recognize that we have not produced more (inaudible) on federal lands and in federal waters.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"I was just at a coal facility, where some 1,200 people lost their jobs.",1,0,1,0,1,1
The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think anyone really believes that you're a person who's going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You'll get your chance in a moment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the answer is I don't believe people think that's the case --,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I will fight for oil, coal and natural gas.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the proof, the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that you're paying at the pump.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If you're paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1.86 a gallon.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, it's $4.00 a gallon.",1,0,0,0,0,1
The price of electricity is up.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"If the president's energy policies are working, you're going to see the cost of energy come down.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore in Virginia where the people want it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Those things will get us the energy we need.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, think about what the governor -- think about what the governor just said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Because the economy was on the verge of collapse, because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney's now promoting.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"So, it's conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices because with his policies, we might be back in that same mess.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong, and at the same time produce energy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we've -- we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"So, I'm all for pipelines.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm all for oil production.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What I'm not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says ""these are imaginary jobs.""",0,0,1,0,0,1
"When you've got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that -- in Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph) to help this work and Governor Romney says I'm opposed.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I'd get rid of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not an energy strategy for the future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He gets the first --,0,0,0,0,0,0
He actually got the first question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I get the last question -- last answer --,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Candy, I don't have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa and that -- they're not phantom jobs.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I appreciate the jobs in coal and oil and gas.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to make sure --,0,0,0,0,0,0
-- we're taking advantage of our energy resources.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll bring back manufacturing to America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to get through a very aggressive energy policy, 31/2 million more jobs in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's critical to our future.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Candy, it's not going to --",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And let me tell you, you're absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down, I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle- income taxpayers to have lower taxes.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"You've seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Health insurance premiums, up $2,500.",1,1,0,0,0,1
The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years.,0,0,0,1,1,1
So I want to get some relief to middle-income families.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's part -- that's part one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"'Cause I'm going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but I'm going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.,1,0,0,0,0,1
So that'll stay the same.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be say everybody gets -- I'll pick a number -- $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit, and so forth, you can use those as part of filling that bucket, if you will, of deductions.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.",1,0,1,0,0,1
No tax on your savings.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That makes life a lot easier.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there'll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Because under the last four years, they've been buried.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And I want to help people in the middle-class.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will not -- I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that's being paid by the highest income taxpayers.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"The president's spending, the president's borrowing will cost this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Not just at the high end.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will not let that happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I'm going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families.",1,0,0,0,0,0
And what's that going to do?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's going to help those families, and it's going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
My philosophy on taxes has been simple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Over the last 15, over the last 20 years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said I would cut taxes for small businesses, who are the drivers and engines of growth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've cut them 18 times.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what I've also said is, if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we've also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So what I've said is, your first $250,000.00 worth of income, no change.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase.",1,0,0,0,1,1
I'm ready to sign that bill right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"But what I've also says is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was president.",0,0,1,0,0,1
We created 23 million new jobs.,1,1,0,0,1,1
That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And he said, ""Yes, I think that's fair.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not only that, he said, ""I think that's what grows the economy.""",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I fundamentally disagree with that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So we just have a different theory.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning, when during a Republican primary he stood on stage and said ""I'm going to give tax cuts"" -- he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said ""tax cuts to everybody,"" including the top 1 percent, you should believe him because that's been his history.",0,0,0,0,1,1
And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You heard what I said about my tax plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And why do I want to bring rates down, and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And for me, this is about jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to get America's economy going again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We can do better than this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We don't have to settle for, how many months, 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now.",1,0,1,0,1,1
There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office.,1,0,1,0,1,1
We can get this economy going again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My five-point plan does it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Energy independence for North America in five years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Cracking down on China when they cheat.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Getting us to a balanced budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fixing our training programs for our workers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And finally, championing small business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know how to make that happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I spent my life in the private sector.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know why jobs come and why they go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they're going now because of the policies of this administration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, 20 percent.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the military's not asking for them.,1,0,1,0,1,1
He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.,1,0,0,0,0,1
That's another trillion dollars -- that's $8 trillion.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middleclass taxes.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"But when he's asked, how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close?",0,0,1,0,0,0
The -- the fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"He's already taken that off the board, capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate so we -- we're not going to get money that way.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We haven't heard from the governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it, you wouldn't take such a sketchy deal and neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn't add up.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And -- and what's at stake here is one of two things, either Candy -- this blows up the deficit because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that he's talking about, $7 trillion - $8 trillion before we even get to the deficit we already have.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Or, alternatively, it's got to be paid for, not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals, that -- that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates.",0,0,1,0,0,1
You're going to be paying for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're going to lose some deductions, and you can't buy the sales pitch.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Nobody who's looked at it that's serious, actually believes it adds up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Well of course they add up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I -- I was -- I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I ran the -- the state of Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion?",1,0,1,0,0,1
That's math that doesn't add up.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We have -- we have a president talking about someone's plan in a way that's completely foreign to what my real plan is.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"We've gone from $10 trillion of national debt, to $16 trillion of national debt.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"If the president were reelected, we'd go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.",1,0,1,0,1,1
This puts us on a road to Greece.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know what it takes to balance budgets.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've done it my entire life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So for instance when he says, ""Yours is a $5 trillion cut.""",0,0,1,0,1,1
Because I'm offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I just described -- I just described to you, Mr. President -- I just described to you precisely how I'd do it which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put they're -- they're deductions and credits...",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And it's Katherine Fenton, who has a question for you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My grandmother, she started off as a secretary in a bank.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she worked her way up to become a vice president of a local bank, but she hit the glass ceiling.",0,0,0,0,1,0
She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not what you did in that generation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And this is one of the reasons why one of the first -- the first bill I signed was something called the Lily Ledbetter bill.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And it's named after this amazing woman who had been doing the same job as a man for years, found out that she was getting paid less, and the Supreme Court said that she couldn't bring suit because she should have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of finding out about it.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is not just a women's issue, this is a family issue, this is a middle-class issue, and that's why we've got to fight for it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It also means that we've got to make sure that young people like yourself are able to afford a college education.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Earlier, Governor Romney talked about he wants to make Pell Grants and other education accessible for young people.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that's exactly what we've done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women, all across the country.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"We did it by taking $60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, and we said, let's just cut out the middleman.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Let's give the money directly to students.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as a consequence, we've seen millions of young people be able to afford college, and that's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"But we've got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we've also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's been one of the hallmarks of my administration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I -- and I went to my staff, and I said, ""How come all the people for these jobs are -- are all men.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They said, ""Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I said, ""Well, gosh, can't we -- can't we find some -- some women that are also qualified?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
And -- and so we -- we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I went to a number of women's groups and said, ""Can you help us find folks,"" and they brought us whole binders full of women.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I'm going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they're going to be anxious to hire women.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's the net of what's happened in the last four years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're still down 580,000 jobs.",1,1,0,0,1,1
"What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford.",1,0,0,0,0,1
This is what I have done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's what I look forward to doing and I know what it takes to make an economy work, and I know what a working economy looks like.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that can't finds a job, or a college level job, that's not what we have to have.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I'm going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Katherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said, ""I'll get back to you.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know a major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that's a mistake.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it's an economic issue for women.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is money out of that family's pocket.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not the kind of advocacy that women need.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.",1,0,1,0,1,1
That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That makes a difference in whether they can go out there and -- and earn a living for their family.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These are not just women's issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's part of what I'm fighting for as president of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I just want to make sure that, I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that that I don't believe...",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I don't think so, Candy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And -- and the -- and the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"I mean for instance, we can now, by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the -- the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"That wasn't true in his time, that's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America -- become energy secure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number two, trade -- I'll crack down on China, President Bush didn't.",1,0,1,0,0,0
I'm also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time.,1,0,0,0,0,1
I want to add more free trade agreements so we'll have more trade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number three, I'm going to get us to a balanced budget.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"President Obama was right, he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And his forecast for the next four years is more deficits, almost that large.",1,0,0,0,1,0
So that's the next area I'm different than President Bush.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then let's take the last one, championing small business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our party has been focused too long.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I came through small business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I understand how hard it is to start a small business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why everything I'll do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to keep their taxes down on small business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the thing I find the most troubling about Obama Care, well it's a long list, but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I think it's important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we had been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle class folks not doing well.,1,0,1,0,0,0
And the plans that I talked about will create even more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts.",1,0,1,0,1,1
That's what took us from surplus to deficit.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries -- in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"That's -- Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what we've done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but we've also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses and not creating a level playing field.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that it wouldn't be helpful to American workers.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And that's the kind of tough trade actions that are required.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, there are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.",0,0,1,0,0,0
George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher.,1,0,0,0,1,1
George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.,1,0,0,0,0,0
He didn't call for self-deportation.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but they're not on economic policy.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that's a mistake.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That's not how we're going to move our economy forward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we've gone through a tough four years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There's no doubt about it.,0,0,1,0,0,0

We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.,1,0,0,0,0,0
My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann's dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We welcome legal immigrants into this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Those who've come here illegally take their place.,0,0,1,0,0,0
What I will do is I'll put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.,0,0,0,0,0,1

But we're also a nation of laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So what I've said is we need to fix a broken immigration system and I've done everything that I can on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fix the system.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"The first thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country and that's good for our economic growth.",1,0,0,0,0,1
They'll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"No, let -- let -- let me go back and speak to the points that the president made and -- and -- and let's get them correct.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is -- which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Number two, I asked the president a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Why, when you said you'd filed legislation in your first year didn't you do it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
He -- he doesn't answer that question.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He said the standard bearer wasn't for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was not the standard bearer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My -- my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"What I was saying is, we're not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented illegals, and take them out of the nation.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Instead let people make their own choice.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"It was a moment ago and I didn't get a chance to, when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth.",0,0,0,0,0,1

I thought we were talking about immigration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do want to make sure that...,0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor Romney says he wasn't referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"His top adviser on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it; not E-Verify, the whole thing.",1,0,0,0,1,1
And it's a bad policy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And it won't help us grow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation and they start companies like Intel and Google.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, we've got to make sure that we do it in a smart way and a comprehensive way, and we make the legal system better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when we make this into a divisive political issue, and when we don't have bipartisan support -- I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we can't...",0,0,1,0,0,0
... we can't -- we have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And it's time for them to get serious on it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This used to be a bipartisan issue.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, let me first of all talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And these aren't just representatives of the United States, they are my representatives.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I send them there, oftentimes into harm's way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know these folks and I know their families.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions.",0,0,1,0,1,1

"Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesn't happen again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Now Governor Romney had a very different response.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points, and that's not how a commander in chief operates.",1,0,1,0,0,1
You don't turn national security into a political issue.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Certainly not right when it's happening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And people -- not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I've made.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did.",1,0,0,0,1,0
"I said that we'd go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there because these are my folks, and I'm the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know that I mean what I say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And -- and I -- I think the president just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk and -- and he takes responsibility for -- for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources, and -- and those terrible things may well happen from time to time.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I -- I'm -- I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We -- we think of their families and care for them deeply.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There were other issues associated with this -- with this tragedy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration, or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And there was no demonstration involved.,1,0,1,0,1,0
It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"Whether there was some misleading, or instead whether we just didn't know what happened, you have to ask yourself why didn't we know five days later when the ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration.",0,0,1,0,0,1
How could we have not known?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I find more troubling than this, that on -- on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador, the first time that's happened since 1979, when -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didn't know what happened, that the president, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fund-raiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, other political event.",1,0,1,0,1,1
I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've read their accounts now about what happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was very clear this was not a demonstration.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This was an attack by terrorists.,1,0,1,0,0,1
And this calls into question the president's whole policy in the Middle East.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Consider the distance between ourselves and -- and Israel, the president said that -- that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and -- and -- and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the Secretary of State, our U.N.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive.",0,0,1,0,0,0
That's not what we do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's not what I do as president, that's not what I do as Commander in Chief.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I -- I think interesting the president just said something which -- which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"It was not a spontaneous demonstration, is that what you're saying?",0,0,1,0,0,0
I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.,1,0,1,0,1,1
This -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.,0,0,1,0,0,1
It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --",0,0,1,0,0,0
-- this was a spontaneous --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm happy to do that, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I just want to make sure that --,0,0,0,0,0,0
-- all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Most recently out in Aurora.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater.",0,0,0,0,1,1

"And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s.",0,0,1,0,0,1
They're using cheap hand guns.,1,0,1,0,1,0
"And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And so what I want is a -- is a comprehensive strategy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.,0,0,1,0,0,1
But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?,0,0,1,0,0,0
And there are a number of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me mention another thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wherever possible the -- the benefit of having two parents in the home, and that's not always possible.",0,0,0,0,0,0

This is the most liberal big-spending record in the United States Senate.,1,0,1,0,0,1
I have fought against excessive spending and outrages.,1,0,1,0,0,0
I have fought to reduce the earmarks and eliminate them.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Do you know that Senator Obama has voted for -- is proposing $860 billion of new spending now?,1,0,0,0,1,1
Do you know that he voted for every increase in spending that I saw come across the floor of the United States Senate while we were working to eliminate these pork barrel earmarks?,1,0,0,0,1,1
"He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3 million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then you have to look at our proposals for our economy, not $860 billion in new spending, but for the kinds of reforms that keep people in their jobs, get middle-income Americans working again, and getting our economy moving again.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You're going to be examining our proposals tonight and in the future, and energy independence is a way to do that, is one of them.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And I've been supporting those and I know how to fix this economy, and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, and stop sending $700 billion a year overseas.",1,0,0,0,0,1

"We're going to have to sit down across the table, Republican and Democrat, as we did in 1983 between Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I know how to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have a clear record of reaching across the aisle, whether it be Joe Lieberman or Russ Feingold or Ted Kennedy or others.",1,0,0,0,0,0
We can work on nuclear power plants.,0,0,0,0,0,1

But we can do them all at once.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's no -- and we have to do them all at once.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All three you mentioned are compelling national security requirements.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Now, I've listed the things that I think have to be at the top of the list.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Energy we have to deal with today, because you're paying $3.80 here in Nashville for gasoline, and it could go up.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And it's a strain on your family budget, but it's also bad for our national security, because countries like Russia and Venezuela and, you know, in some cases, countries like Iran, are benefiting from higher oil prices.",1,0,1,0,0,1
That's why I've called for an investment of $15 billion a year over 10 years.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Our goal should be, in 10 year's time, we are free of dependence on Middle Eastern oil.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And, number three, we've got to deal with education so that our young people are competitive in a global economy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But just one point I want to make, Tom.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator McCain mentioned looking at our records.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Senator McCain likes to talk about earmarks a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to go line by line through every item in the federal budget and eliminate programs that don't work and make sure that those that do work, work better and cheaper.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But understand this: We also have to look at where some of our tax revenues are going.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So when Senator McCain proposes a $300 billion tax cut, a continuation not only of the Bush tax cuts, but an additional $200 billion that he's going to give to big corporations, including big oil companies, $4 billion worth, that's money out of the system.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And we're going to have to eliminate those that aren't working.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know a lot of them that aren't working.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of them is in defense spending, because I've taken on some of the defense contractors.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion in a deal for an Air Force tanker that was done in a corrupt fashion.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"And sometimes those projects, not -- not the overhead projector that Senator Obama asked for, but some of them that are really good projects, will have -- will have to be eliminated, as well.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And they'll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So we're going to have to tell the American people that spending is going to have to be cut in America.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I recommend a spending freeze that -- except for defense, Veterans Affairs, and some other vital programs, we'll just have to have across-the-board freeze.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And some of those programs may not grow as much as we would like for them to, but we can establish priorities with full transparency, with full knowledge of the American people, and full consultation, not done behind closed doors and shoving earmarks in the middle of the night into programs that we don't even -- sometimes we don't even know about until months later.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're not -- we're not -- we're not rifle shots here.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Frankly, I'm not going to tell that person without health insurance that, ""I'm sorry, you'll have to wait.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to tell you Americans we'll get to work right away and we'll get to work together, and we can get them all done, because that's what America has been doing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, a lot of you remember the tragedy of 9/11 and where you were on that day and, you know, how all of the country was ready to come together and make enormous changes to make us not only safer, but to make us a better country and a more unified country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And President Bush did some smart things at the outset, but one of the opportunities that was missed was, when he spoke to the American people, he said, ""Go out and shop.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so it's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And let's take the example of energy, which we already spoke about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There is going to be the need for each and every one of us to start thinking about how we use energy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe in the need for increased oil production.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to have to explore new ways to get more oil, and that includes offshore drilling.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It includes telling the oil companies, that currently have 68 million acres that they're not using, that either you use them or you lose them.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And that's going to require effort from each and every one of us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the last point I just want to make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think the young people of America are especially interested in how they can serve, and that's one of the reasons why I'm interested in doubling the Peace Corps, making sure that we are creating a volunteer corps all across this country that can be involved in their community, involved in military service, so that military families and our troops are not the only ones bearing the burden of renewing America.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's something that all of us have to be involved with and that requires some leadership from Washington.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think it starts with Washington.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We've got to show that we've got good habits, because if we're running up trillion dollar debts that we're passing on to the next generation, then a lot of people are going to think, ""Well, you know what?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"There's easy money out there.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It means -- and I have to, again, repeat this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It means looking (ph) at the spending side, but also at the revenue side.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And so part of the problem, I think, for a lot of people who are listening here tonight is they don't feel as if they are sharing the burden with other folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, you know, it's tough to ask a teacher who's making $30,000 or $35,000 a year to tighten her belt when people who are making much more than her are living pretty high on the hog.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's why I think it's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's an example of an unfair burden sharing.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That's using a hatchet to cut the federal budget.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I want to use a scalpel so that people who need help are getting help and those of us, like myself and Senator McCain, who don't need help, aren't getting it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's how we make sure that everybody is willing to make a few sacrifices.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There has been five or six of them and if you wait long enough, there will probably be another one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But he wants to raise taxes.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"My friends, the last president to raise taxes during tough economic times was Herbert Hoover, and he practiced protectionism as well, which I'm sure we'll get to at some point.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, last year up to this time, we've lost 700,000 jobs in America.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"The only bright spot is that over 300,000 jobs have been created by small businesses.",1,1,0,0,0,1
Senator Obama's secret that you don't know is that his tax increases will increase taxes on 50 percent of small business revenue.,1,0,1,0,1,1
Small businesses across America will have to cut jobs and will have their taxes increase and won't be able to hire because of Senator Obama's tax policies.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"You know, he said some time ago, he said he would forgo his tax increases if the economy was bad.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"So let's not raise anybody's taxes, my friends, and make it be very clear to you I am not in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I am in favor of leaving the tax rates alone and reducing the tax burden on middle-income Americans by doubling your tax exemption for every child from $3,500 to $7,000.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"To giving every American a $5,000 refundable tax credit and go out and get the health insurance you want rather than mandates and fines for small businesses, as Senator Obama's plan calls for.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And let's create jobs and let's get our economy going again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And let's not raise anybody's taxes.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Tom, can I respond to this briefly?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The tax issue, because I think it's very important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Tom, we're going to have to take on entitlements and I think we've got to do it quickly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to have a lot of work to do, so I can't guarantee that we're going to do it in the next two years, but I'd like to do in the my first term as president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think it's important to understand, we're not going to solve Social Security and Medicare unless we understand the rest of our tax policies.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And you know, Senator McCain, I think the ""Straight Talk Express"" lost a wheel on that one.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of Americans, 95 percent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year, you will not see a single dime of your taxes go up.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"If you make $200,000 a year or less, your taxes will go down.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So the vast majority of small businesses would get a tax cut under my plan.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Some small business owners, a lot of them, can't even afford health insurance for themselves.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"He wants to give average Fortune 500 CEO an additional $700,000 in tax cuts.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, if we get our tax policies right so that they're good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Senator McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare, because we will have a health care plan that actually works for you, reduces spending and costs over the long term, and Social Security that is stable and solvent for all Americans and not just some.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Hey, I'll answer the question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look -- look, it's not that hard to fix Social Security, Tom.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Social Security is not that tough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We know what the problems are, my friends, and we know what the fixes are.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to sit down together across the table.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I saw it done with our -- our wonderful Ronald Reagan, a conservative from California, and the liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill from Massachusetts.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"That's what we need more of, and that's what I've done in Washington.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm not too popular sometimes with my own party, much less his.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So Medicare, it's going to be a little tougher.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to be a little tougher because we're talking about very complex and difficult issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My friends, what we have to do with Medicare is have a commission, have the smartest people in America come together, come up with recommendations, and then, like the base-closing commission idea we had, then we should have Congress vote up or down.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Let's not let them fool with it anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's too much special interests and too many lobbyists working there.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"So let's have -- and let's have the American people say, ""Fix it for us.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, just back on this -- on this tax, you know, again, it's back to our first question here about rhetoric and record.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts.,1,0,0,0,0,1
You know he came to the Senate and never once proposed legislation to do that?,1,0,1,0,0,0
So let's look at our record.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have fought excess spending.,1,0,1,0,0,0
I have fought to reform government.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's look at our records, my friends, and then listen to my vision for the future of America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we'll get our economy going again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, we are in tough economic times; we all know that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And let's keep -- never forget the struggle that Americans are in today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when we can -- when we have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet, I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"And I introduced the first legislation, and we forced votes on it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"That's the good news, my friends.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The bad news is we lost.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But we kept the debate going, and we kept this issue to -- to posing to Americans the danger that climate change opposes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Obama says that it has to be safe or disposable or something like that.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Look, I -- I was on Navy ships that had nuclear power plants.",0,0,1,0,1,1

"The Japanese, the British, the French do it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And we can do it, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Obama has opposed that.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternate -- alternative energies for -- for hybrid, for hydrogen, for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We can do that, we as Americans, because we're the best innovators, we're the best producers, and 95 percent of the people who are our market live outside of the United States of America.",1,0,0,0,0,1
This is one of the biggest challenges of our times.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it is absolutely critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it's an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily, here in the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we've got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.",1,0,1,0,0,1

"Contrary to what Senator McCain keeps on saying, I favor nuclear power as one component of our overall energy mix.",1,0,0,0,0,1
But this is another example where I think it is important to look at the record.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator McCain and I actually agree on something.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"He said a while back that the big problem with energy is that for 30 years, politicians in Washington haven't done anything.",1,0,1,0,0,1
What Senator McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them.,0,0,1,0,0,1

One last point I want to make on energy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator McCain talks a lot about drilling, and that's important, but we have three percent of the world's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world's oil.",1,0,1,0,0,1
So what that means is that we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And we're not going to be able to deal with the climate crisis if our only solution is to use more fossil fuels that create global warming.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"We're going to have to come up with alternatives, and that means that the United States government is working with the private sector to fund the kind of innovation that we can then export to countries like China that also need energy and are setting up one coal power plant a week.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Tom, wave like that and I'll look at you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney.",1,0,1,0,1,1
You know who voted for it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know who voted against it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have fought time after time against these pork barrel -- these bills that come to the floor and they have all kinds of goodies and all kinds of things in them for everybody and they buy off the votes.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"I vote against them, my friends.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We can bridge the gap between imported oil, which is a national security issue, as well as any other, and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil, because when people know there's a greater supply, then the cost of that will go down.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"And as far as nuclear power is concerned, again, look at the record.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Senator Obama has approved storage and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.,1,0,1,0,1,1

"Well, you know, as I travel around the country, this is one of the single most frequently asked issues that I get, is the issue of health care.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is breaking family budgets.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can't tell you how many people I meet who don't have health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"If you're a small business, it's a crushing burden.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So one of the things that I have said from the start of this campaign is that we have a moral commitment as well as an economic imperative to do something about the health care crisis that so many families are facing.,1,0,0,0,0,0
So here's what I would do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you've got health care already, and probably the majority of you do, then you can keep your plan if you are satisfied with it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You can keep your choice of doctor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to work with your employer to lower the cost of your premiums by up to $2,500 a year.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And we're going to do it by investing in prevention.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to do it by making sure that we use information technology so that medical records are actually on computers instead of you filling forms out in triplicate when you go to the hospital.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"If you don't have health insurance, you're going to be able to buy the same kind of insurance that Senator McCain and I enjoy as federal employees.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Because there's a huge pool, we can drop the costs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And nobody will be excluded for pre-existing conditions, which is a huge problem.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, Senator McCain has a different kind of approach.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"He says that he's going to give you a $5,000 tax credit.",0,0,0,0,0,1
What he doesn't tell you is that he is going to tax your employer-based health care benefits for the first time ever.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"So what one hand giveth, the other hand taketh away.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He would also strip away the ability of states to provide some of the regulations on insurance companies to make sure you're not excluded for pre-existing conditions or your mammograms are covered or your maternity is covered.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And that is fundamentally the wrong way to go.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"In fact, just today business organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce, which generally are pretty supportive of Republicans, said that this would lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"That, I don't think, is the kind of change that we need.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've got to have somebody who is fighting for patients and making sure that you get decent, affordable health care.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's something that I'm committed to doing as president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You really identified one of the really major challenges that America faces.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Co-payments go up, costs go up, skyrocketing costs, which make people less and less able to afford health insurance in America.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Let's put health records online, that will reduce medical errors, as they call them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's have community health centers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what is at stake here in this health care issue is the fundamental difference between myself and Senator Obama.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As you notice, he starts talking about government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He starts saying, government will do this and government will do that, and then government will, and he'll impose mandates.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If you're a small business person and you don't insure your employees, Senator Obama will fine you.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If you're a parent and you're struggling to get health insurance for your children, Senator Obama will fine you.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"They can take it anywhere, across state lines.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Of course it's OK to go across state lines because in Arizona they may offer a better plan that suits you best than it does here in Tennessee.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And if you do the math, those people who have employer-based health benefits, if you put the tax on it and you have what's left over and you add $5,000 that you're going to get as a refundable tax credit, do the math, 95 percent of the American people will have increased funds to go out and buy the insurance of their choice and to shop around and to get -- all of those people will be covered except for those who have these gold-plated Cadillac kinds of policies.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, like hair transplants, I might need one of those myself.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Every parent I know would acquire health insurance for their children if they could.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Obviously small business people want to give their employees health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Of course they all want to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think it's a responsibility, in this respect, in that we should have available and affordable health care to every American citizen, to every family member.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And with the plan that -- that I have, that will do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But government mandates I -- I'm always a little nervous about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it is certainly my responsibility.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is certainly small-business people and others, and they understand that responsibility.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But they certainly are a little nervous when Senator Obama says, if you don't get the health care policy that I think you should have, then you're going to get fined.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, by the way, Senator Obama has never mentioned how much that fine might be.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Perhaps we might find that out tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, why don't -- why don't -- let's talk about this, Tom, because there was just a lot of stuff out there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think it should be a right for every American.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In a country as wealthy as ours, for us to have people who are going bankrupt because they can't pay their medical bills -- for my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they're saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don't have to pay her treatment, there's something fundamentally wrong about that.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And, Tom, I know that we're under time constraints, but Senator McCain through a lot of stuff out there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
You'll still have choice of doctor.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Small businesses are not going to have a mandate.,0,0,0,0,1,1
What we're going to give you is a 50 percent tax credit to help provide health care for those that you need.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, it's true that I say that you are going to have to make sure that your child has health care, because children are relatively cheap to insure and we don't want them going to the emergency room for treatable illnesses like asthma.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And when Senator McCain says that he wants to provide children health care, what he doesn't mention is he voted against the expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program that is responsible for making sure that so many children who didn't have previously health insurance have it now.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, the final point I'll make on this whole issue of government intrusion and mandates -- it is absolutely true that I think it is important for government to crack down on insurance companies that are cheating their customers, that don't give you the fine print, so you end up thinking that you're paying for something and, when you finally get sick and you need it, you're not getting it.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They will find a state -- maybe Arizona, maybe another state -- where there are no requirements for you to get cancer screenings, where there are no requirements for you to have to get pre-existing conditions, and they will all set up shop there.",1,0,0,0,1,1
That's how in banking it works.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And in that situation, what happens is, is that the protections you have, the consumer protections that you need, you're not going to have available to you.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That is a fundamental difference that I have with Senator McCain.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He believes in deregulation in every circumstance.,1,0,0,0,0,0
That's what we've been going through for the last eight years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It hasn't worked, and we need fundamental change.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't believe that -- did we hear the size of the fine?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But having said that, America -- and we'll hear a lot of criticism.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I've heard a lot of criticism about America, and our national security policy, and all that, and much of that criticism is justified.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But the fact is, America is the greatest force for good in the history of the world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"My friends, we have gone to all four corners of the Earth and shed American blood in defense, usually, of somebody else's freedom and our own.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So we are peacemakers and we're peacekeepers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that question can only be answered by someone with the knowledge and experience and the judgment, the judgment to know when our national security is not only at risk, but where the United States of America can make a difference in preventing genocide, in preventing the spread of terrorism, in doing the things that the United States has done, not always well, but we've done because we're a nation of good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I am convinced that my record, going back to my opposition from sending the Marines to Lebanon, to supporting our efforts in Kosovo and Bosnia and the first Gulf War, and my judgment, I think, is something that I'm -- a record that I'm willing to stand on.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Obama was wrong about Iraq and the surge.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He was wrong about Russia when they committed aggression against Georgia.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And in his short career, he does not understand our national security challenges.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We don't have time for on-the-job training, my friends.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are some things I don't understand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't understand how we ended up invading a country that had nothing to do with 9/11, while Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda are setting up base camps and safe havens to train terrorists to attack us.",1,0,1,0,1,1
That was Senator McCain's judgment and it was the wrong judgment.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"When Senator McCain was cheerleading the president to go into Iraq, he suggested it was going to be quick and easy, we'd be greeted as liberators.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"That was the wrong judgment, and it's been costly to us.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So one of the difficulties with Iraq is that it has put an enormous strain, first of all, on our troops, obviously, and they have performed heroically and honorably and we owe them an extraordinary debt of gratitude.",0,0,0,0,1,1
But it's also put an enormous strain on our budget.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"We're spending $10 billion a month in Iraq at a time when the Iraqis have a $79 billion surplus, $79 billion.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"And we need that $10 billion a month here in the United States to put people back to work, to do all these wonderful things that Senator McCain suggested we should be doing, but has not yet explained how he would pay for.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, Senator McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We are a force of good in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"And the strains that have been placed on our alliances around the world and the respect that's been diminished over the last eight years has constrained us being able to act on something like the genocide in Darfur, because we don't have the resources or the allies to do everything that we should be doing.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"That's going to change when I'm president, but we can't change it unless we fundamentally change Senator McCain's and George Bush's foreign policy.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It has not worked for America.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"If we could've stopped Rwanda, surely, if we had the ability, that would be something that we would have to strongly consider and act.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when genocide is happening, when ethnic cleansing is happening somewhere around the world and we stand idly by, that diminishes us.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But understand that there's a lot of cruelty around the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're not going to be able to be everywhere all the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why it's so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's take the example of Darfur just for a moment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We could be providing logistical support, setting up a no-fly zone at relatively little cost to us, but we can only do it if we can help mobilize the international community and lead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we had done what Senator Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which General Petraeus, our chief -- chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"There was a lot at stake there, my friends.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'll bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That requires a cool hand at the tiller.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This requires a person who understands what our -- the limits of our capability are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be -- excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"In Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize you're sending America's most precious asset, American blood, into harm's way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, again, I know those situations.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've been in them all my life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nation's security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I may have to make those tough decisions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I won't take them lightly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we had also better be darn sure we don't leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Katie, it's a terrific question and we have a difficult situation in Pakistan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn't finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"So what happened was we got distracted, we diverted resources, and ultimately bin Laden escaped, set up base camps in the mountains of Pakistan in the northwest provinces there.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"They are now raiding our troops in Afghanistan, destabilizing the situation.",1,0,1,0,1,1
They're stronger now than at any time since 2001.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"And that's why I think it's so important for us to reverse course, because that's the central front on terrorism.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They are plotting to kill Americans right now.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"As Secretary Gates, the defense secretary, said, the war against terrorism began in that region and that's where it will end.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So part of the reason I think it's so important for us to end the war in Iraq is to be able to get more troops into Afghanistan, put more pressure on the Afghan government to do what it needs to do, eliminate some of the drug trafficking that's funding terrorism.",1,0,0,0,0,1
But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We can't coddle, as we did, a dictator, give him billions of dollars and then he's making peace treaties with the Taliban and militants.",1,0,1,0,1,0
"What I've said is we're going to encourage democracy in Pakistan, expand our nonmilitary aid to Pakistan so that they have more of a stake in working with us, but insisting that they go after these militants.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We will kill bin Laden; we will crush Al Qaida.,0,0,1,0,1,0
That has to be our biggest national security priority.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Katie (ph), thank you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, my hero is a guy named Teddy Roosevelt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly -- talk softly, but carry a big stick.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Obama likes to talk loudly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, he said he wants to announce that he's going to attack Pakistan.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"You know, if you are a country and you're trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"We drove the Russians out with -- the Afghan freedom fighters drove the Russians out of Afghanistan, and then we made a most serious mistake.",1,0,1,0,1,1
We washed our hands of Afghanistan.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"The Taliban came back in, Al Qaida, we then had the situation that required us to conduct the Afghan war.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, our relations with Pakistan are critical, because the border areas are being used as safe havens by the Taliban and Al Qaida and other extremist organizations, and we have to get their support.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, General Petraeus had a strategy, the same strategy -- very, very different, because of the conditions and the situation -- but the same fundamental strategy that succeeded in Iraq.",0,0,1,0,0,1

... just a quick follow-up on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we're going to have follow-ups, then I will want follow-ups, as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It'd be fine with me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It'd be fine with me.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"You're doing a great job, Tom.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, I -- I want to be very clear about what I said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody called for the invasion of Pakistan.,0,0,1,0,1,1
Senator McCain continues to repeat this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I said was the same thing that the audience here today heard me say, which is, if Pakistan is unable or unwilling to hunt down bin Laden and take him out, then we should.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, that I think has to be our policy, because they are threatening to kill more Americans.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, Senator McCain suggests that somehow, you know, I'm green behind the ears and, you know, I'm just spouting off, and he's somber and responsible.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Senator McCain, this is the guy who sang, ""Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,"" who called for the annihilation of North Korea.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"That I don't think is an example of ""speaking softly.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is the person who, after we had -- we hadn't even finished Afghanistan, where he said, ""Next up, Baghdad.""",1,0,1,0,1,0
So I agree that we have to speak responsibly and we have to act responsibly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the reason Pakistan -- the popular opinion of America had diminished in Pakistan was because we were supporting a dictator, Musharraf, had given him $10 billion over seven years, and he had suspended civil liberties.",1,0,1,0,1,1
We were not promoting democracy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"This is the kind of policies that ultimately end up undermining our ability to fight the war on terrorism, and it will change when I'm president.",1,0,1,0,0,0

I understand what it's like to send young American's in harm's way.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I say -- I was joking with a veteran -- I hate to even go into this.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I was joking with an old veteran friend, who joked with me, about Iran.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges.,0,0,0,0,1,1

Energy is going to be key in dealing with Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think they've engaged in an evil behavior and I think that it is important that we understand they're not the old Soviet Union but they still have nationalist impulses that I think are very dangerous.,0,0,1,0,0,1

That starts putting the squeeze on them.,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've been able to set clear goals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what a Chief Executive Officer does.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I see it as a question of values.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely, they're wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more, freedom, free markets, political freedom.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The power of example is America's greatest power in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that means, for example, standing up for human rights.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they're having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So we've got to enforce our civil rights laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to deal with things like racial profiling.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have to keep our military strong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But our real power comes, I think, from our values.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think they'll look at us with envy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We're a freedom-loving nation and if we're an arrogant nation they'll view us that way, but if we're a humble nation they'll respect us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That there is some resentment of U.S. power.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time.",1,0,1,0,0,1
The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough.,0,0,1,0,0,1
We need to do more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Take, for example, Third World debt.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We can help build coalitions but we can't put our troops all around the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can lend money but we have to do it wisely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So we got to be guarded in our generosity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam HusseinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends.",0,0,1,0,0,0

When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic.,1,0,0,0,0,0
He caused the death of so many people.,1,0,0,0,1,0
He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator.,1,0,1,0,1,1
And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and he's still going to try to be actively involved.",1,0,1,0,0,1

"In some of the discussions we've had about when it's appropriate for the U.S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that you've laid down have given me the impression that if it's something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldn't be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U.S. ought to get involved with troops.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, I understand, and Africa is important.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to be judicious in its use.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I wouldn't have sent troops to Haiti.,0,0,1,0,1,0
I didn't think it was a mission worthwhile.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I think we have to be very reticent about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"And acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in World War II, we laid down the Marshall Plan, President Truman did.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We got intimately involved in building NATO and other structures there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We still have lots of troops in Europe.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And what did we do in the late '40's and '50's and '60's?,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it was also military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back.,0,0,0,0,0,1
First let me just say one comment about what the vice president said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think one of the lessons in between World War I and World War II is we let our military atrophy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And we can't do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to rebuild our military.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And I mentioned one, and that's the Balkans.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would very much like to get our troops out of there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I recognize we can't do it now, nor do I advocate an immediate withdrawal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That would be an abrogation of our agreement with NATO.,1,0,1,0,0,0
No one is suggesting that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But I think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our European friends to convince them to put troops on the ground.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And there is an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it's important for us to be training Columbians in that part of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe I'm missing something here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our military is meant to fight and win war.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what it's meant to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when it gets overextended, morale drops.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the Korean peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't disagree with that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what we did in Haiti.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are no more than a handful of American military personnel in Haiti now.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That's really about all we can do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water, and all kinds of violence there, right in one of our neighboring countries there, then I think that we did the right thing there.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, we can't be -- we can't allow ourselves to get overextended.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I certainly agree with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's why I've supported building up our capacity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've devoted in the budget I've proposed, as I said last week, more than twice as much as the governor has proposed.",1,0,0,0,0,1
I think that it's in better shape now than he generally does.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've had some disagreements about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty, and that's not what the joint chiefs say.",1,0,0,0,0,1
But there's no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there's some pretty egregious examples recently.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One being Russia, where we had IMF loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didn't help the nation.",1,0,1,0,1,1

It needs to be available for emergency situations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I thought the President did the right thing with Mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in Mexico.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I just want to make sure the return is good.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think there need to be reforms in the IMF.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I've generally supported it, but I've seen them make some calls that I thought were highly questionable.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I think that there's a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the IMF.,0,0,0,0,0,1

I've worked on this issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it.",0,0,1,0,1,1

"Again, that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me comment on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And maybe it's just our difference in government, the way we view government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to empower the people.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“we do it this way, so should you.Ã¢â‚¬Â I think we can help.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know we've got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But take Russia, for example.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform.",1,0,1,0,1,1
The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They're going to have to make the decision themselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries and/or entities invest capital, there's a reasonable rate of return, a way to get the money out of the economy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But Russia has to make the decision.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We can work with them on security matters, for example, but it's their call to make.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I'm not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from, but I think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, Ã¢â‚¬Å“we do it this way, so should you.Ã¢â‚¬Â Now, we trust freedom.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We know freedom is a powerful, powerful, powerful force, much bigger than the United States of America, as we saw recently in the Balkans.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But maybe I misunderstand where you're coming from, Mr. Vice President, but I think the United States must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values, but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Far be it from me to suggest otherwise.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I just -- I think that racial profiling is a serious problem.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I know it's been going on a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years.,1,0,0,0,0,1
But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I was surprised at the extent of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we've now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's not an easy problem to solve.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of my concerns, though, is I don't want to federalize the local police forces.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I want to -- obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law, but we need to make sure that internal affairs divisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe in local control of governments, and obviously if they don't there needs to be a consequence at the federal level.",0,0,0,0,0,1

I don't think they ought to be held guilty.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"But I do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks, get it done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you can't, there will be a federal consequence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And not only the training in police procedures, but human relations.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in America.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And as for singling people out because of race, you know, James Byrd was singled out because of his race in Texas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And other Americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity.,1,0,1,0,0,1
And that's why I think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think these crimes are different.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think they're different because they're based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they're intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people.",0,0,1,0,0,1
We've got one in Texas.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The three men who murdered James Byrd, guess what's going to happen to them?",0,0,1,0,0,0
They're going to be put to death.,1,0,1,0,1,0
A jury found them guilty.,1,0,1,0,1,0
It's going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And it's the right cause.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in America.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Arab-Americans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence.,1,0,1,0,0,1

"My friend, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, is pushing a law to make sure that Arab-Americans are treated with respect.",1,0,0,0,0,1

It's an issue throughout our society.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"It's the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them.",0,0,0,0,0,0

But Columbine spoke to a larger issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's really a matter of culture.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I also believe in the Golden Rule.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We do have a serious problem in our culture.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Tipper and I have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children.,1,0,0,0,0,0

"And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I mean, the fact is that there -- even though no state wants them, there are guns in some schools.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And the reason it's so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Some kid who feels like -- doesn't matter where the gun comes from, it could be a cheap gun, expensive gun.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What matters is something in this person's head says there is not going to be a consequence.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws.,1,0,0,0,0,0
We believe in tough love.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"If laws need to be strengthened, like instant background checks, that's important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I've got a plan to do something about that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's to make health care affordable and available this way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, there's some who should be buying health care who choose not to.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some of the healthy folks, healthy young kids say I'll never get sick, therefore I don't need health care right now.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"One, we need more community health centers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've developed -- put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country.,1,0,0,0,0,1
These are places where people can get primary care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secondly -- and they're good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're very important parts of the safety net of health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets.",1,0,0,0,0,1
It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down.",1,0,0,0,0,1
I think that's the very best way to go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's one of my top priorities, Jim, to give every single child in the United States affordable health care within the next four years.",0,0,0,0,0,0

So I want to proceed carefully to cover more people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think we should start by greatly expanding the so-called child health insurance or CHIP program to give health insurance to every single child in this country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I think it's intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So it's one of my top priorities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"I'm not aware of any program -- well, I'll just leave it at that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it ought to be a top priority.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, let me say he's not for a government-run health care system?",0,0,1,0,0,0
I thought that's exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government-run health care system.,1,0,1,0,0,0
It was fortunately stopped in its tracks.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, I don't know about all these percentages that he throws out, but I do know that -- I speculate that the reason why he didn't answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right, the facts were right about Texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women, is because those facts are correct.",1,0,1,1,0,1
"And as for why it happened, I'm no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests.",1,0,1,0,1,1

It has grown in the past seven years.,1,0,0,0,0,1
It can and will grow even more in the next four.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think that Senator Kennedy's policies and recommendations for the handling of the Castro regime are probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendations that he's made during the course of this campaign.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"In effect, what Senator Kennedy recommends is that the United States government should give help to the exiles and to those within Cuba who oppose the Castro regime - provided they are anti-Batista.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Now let's just see what this means.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"The charter of the United Nations - its Preamble, Article I and Article II - also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affairs of another.",1,0,0,1,0,1
"Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
This is the major recommendation that he's made.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There was a Communist dictator that we inherited from the previous Administration.,0,0,1,0,0,1

We are quarantining Mr. Castro today.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"We're quarantining him diplomatically by bringing back our Ambassador; economically by cutting off trade, and Senator Kennedy's suggestion that the trade that we cut off is not significant is just one hundred percent wrong.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"By cutting off trade, by cutting off our diplomatic relations as we have, we will quarantine this regime so that the people of Cuba themselves will take care of Mr. Castro.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.,0,1,1,0,0,0
"There isn't any doubt about that, number one.",0,0,0,0,0,0

If the United States had stronger prestige and influence in Latin America it could persuade - as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1940 - the countries of Latin America to join in an economic quarantine of Castro.,1,1,1,0,0,1
"That's the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime - and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.,1,0,1,0,1,0

This is a race between the Vice President and myself for the presidency of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But I've not made a judgment, and I have not narrowed down a list of three or four people, among whom would be the candidate.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"If you don't mind, I'd like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comments that Senator Kennedy made on the previous question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Eh- He was talking about the Castro regime and what we had been eh- doing in Latin America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would like to point out that when we look at our programs in Latin America, we find that we have appropriated five times as much for Latin America as was appropriated by the previous Administration; we find that we have two billion dollars more for the Export-Import Bank; we have a new bank for Latin America alone of a billion dollars; we have the new program which was submitted at the Bogota Conference - this new program that President Eisenhower submitted, approved by the last Congress - for five hundred million dollars.",1,1,0,0,1,1
"We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.,1,1,1,0,1,1

"Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"First of all, the report to which Senator Kennedy refers is one that was made many, many months ago and related particularly to the uh - period immediately after Sputnik.",1,0,1,1,0,1
"Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about ""what about American prestige abroad"": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Well let me make one thing clear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Kennedy has a responsibility to criticize those things that are wrong, but he has also a responsibility to be right in his criticism.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Every one of these items that I have mentioned he's been wrong - dead wrong.,1,0,1,0,0,0
And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Now Senator Kennedy has referred to the vote on Communist China.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Let's look at the vote on Hungary.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Let's look at the reaction eh - reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?,0,0,1,0,1,0
"America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I've just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I downgrade, Mr. Nixon, is the leadership the country is getting, not the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made.,0,0,1,0,0,0
The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"We have - may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest - you yourself said to Khrushchev, ""You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we're ahead of you in color television"" in your famous discussion in the kitchen.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Secondly, I didn't say we had the worst slums in the world.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I said we had too many slums.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And that they are bad, and we ought to do something about them, and we ought to support housing legislation which this Administration has opposed.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I didn't say we had the worst education in the world.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Part of that, as the Gallup Polls show, is because the Soviet Union made a breakthrough in outer space.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Mr. George Allen, head of your Information Service, has said that that made the people of the world begin to wonder whether we were first in science.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We're first in other areas of science but in space, which is the new science, we're not first.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Yes, I think the next president of the United States should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of tests, number one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we fail then, if we're unable to come to an agreement - and I hope we can come to an agreement because it does not merely involve now the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as atomic powers.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Because new breakthroughs in atomic energy technology there's some indications that by the time the next president's term of office has come to an end, there may be ten, fifteen, or twenty countries with an atomic capacity, perhaps that many testing bombs with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chances that more and more countries will have an atomic capacity, with more and more chance of war.",0,0,1,0,1,1
So one more effort should be made.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"They can be carried out underground, they c- could be carried on in outer space.",1,0,1,0,0,1
But I believe the effort should be made once more by who's ever elected president of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I hope we can succeed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
There may be testing in outer space.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.,0,1,0,0,0,0
It's possible to detect those kind of tests.,0,0,1,0,0,0
The kind of tests which you can't detect are underground or in - in uh - perhaps in outer space.,0,0,1,0,0,1
So that I'm hopeful we can try once more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"China may have it by 1963, Egypt.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we're going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We ought to make one last effort.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months.",1,1,0,0,1,1
"As a matter of fact, there's been a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have been negotiating.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"I've reached the conclusion, too, based on the reports that have been made, that they may be cheating.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster.",0,0,1,0,0,1
There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well the conditions I laid out in one of our previous television debates, and it's rather difficult to be much more specific than that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's look at the other side of the coin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We do not help it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We can, in other words, negotiate many of these items of difference between us without going to the summit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"When I say ""phony spirit,"" I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think the president of the United States last winter indicated that before he'd go to the summit in May he did last fall, he indicated that there should be some agenda, that there should be some prior agreement.",0,0,0,0,0,1
He hoped that there would be uh - b- be an agreement in part in disarmament.,0,1,0,1,0,0
He also expressed the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in Berlin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Soviet Union does understand strength.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is - I have felt, has been Eastern Europe.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"I've been critical of the Administration's failure to suggest policies which would make it possible for us to establish, for example, closer relations with Poland, particularly after the fifty-five-fifty-six period and the Hungarian revolution.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We indicated at that time that we were not going to intervene militarily.,1,0,0,0,0,0
But there was a period there when Poland demonstrated a national independence and even the Polish government moved some differn- di- distance away from the Soviet Union.,1,0,1,0,0,1
I suggested that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy closer economic ties.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate.",1,0,1,0,1,1
We passed the bill in the Senate this year but it didn't pass the House.,1,0,0,0,1,1
I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.,0,1,1,1,0,1
"Secondly, the relations between Russia and China.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They are now engaged in a debate over whether war is the means of Communizing the world or whether they should use subversion, infiltration, economic struggles and all the rest.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
India started from about the same place that China did.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Chinese Communists have been moving ahead the last ten years.,0,0,1,0,0,1
India under a free society has been making some progress.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free.",0,0,0,0,0,1
This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.,0,0,1,0,0,1
It's expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They want to be free.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"They want to stay free, independent perhaps of us, but certainly independent of the Communists.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We can put the Communists on the defensive.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Right under the Soviet gun, with Soviet troops there, he is in a very difficult position in taking anything independent, a position which would be independent of the Soviet Union.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland.",1,0,0,0,1,1
This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I would just like to s- add this one point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"We have to let them know that we want to help them, not because we're simply trying to save our own skins, not because we're simply trying to fight Communism; but because we care for them, because we stand for freedom, because if there were no Communism in the world, we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He says he supports the President's position.,1,0,0,0,0,0
He says that he voted for the resolution.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made.",1,0,0,0,0,0
He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Either he's for the President and he's against the position that those who opposed the President in fifty-five and fifty-nine - and the Senator's position itself, stated the other day in our debate - either he is for the President and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debated.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say ""I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;"" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us.",0,1,1,0,0,1
I support the President's position.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have always opposed drawing a line.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want.",0,1,1,0,0,0
And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It isn't enough for him to say ""I support the President's position, that I voted for the resolution.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course, he voted for the resolution - it was virtually unanimous.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But the point is, what about his error in voting for the amendment, which was not adopted, and then persisting in it in fifty-nine, persisting in it in the debate.",1,0,1,0,0,1
It's very simple for him to clear it up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He can say now that he no longer believes that a line should be drawn leaving these islands out of the perimeter of defense.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The resolution commits the president in the United States, which I supported, to defend uh - Formosa, the Pescadores, and if it was his military judgment, these islands.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed.",1,1,1,0,1,1
The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"General Twining, in January, fifty-nine, described the position of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The position of the United States has been that this build-up, in the words of the president, has been foolish.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Mr. Herter has said these islands are indefensible.,1,0,1,0,1,1
Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because he will not withdraw, because he's committed to these islands, because we've been unable to persuade him to withdraw, we are in a very difficult position.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And therefore, the President's judgment has been that we should defend the islands if, in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field, the attack on these islands should be part of an overall attack on Formosa.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"In view of the difficulties we've had with the islands, in view of the difficulties and disputes we've had with Chiang Kai-shek, that's the only position we can take.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's not the position you took, however.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.,1,0,1,0,1,1
And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.,1,0,1,0,0,1
And that's the testimony of uh - General Twining and the Assistant Secretary of State in fifty-eight.,1,0,1,0,0,0
I uh - said that I've served this country for fourteen years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I served it uh - in the war.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it's going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.,1,0,0,0,0,1
We had a recession in fifty-eight.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We had a recession in fifty-four.,0,0,0,0,1,1
We're not moving ahead in education the way we should.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We didn't make a judgment in fifty-seven and fifty-six and fifty-five and fifty-four that outer space would be important.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don't recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And if we fail, the cause of freedom fails.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr. Nixon said that we should not regard them as pawns in the cold war; we should identify ourselves with them.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"If that were true, why didn't we identify ourselves with the people of Africa?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't we bring students over here?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why did we suddenly offer Congo three hundred students last June when they had the tremendous revolt?,0,0,0,0,1,1
That was more than we had offered to all of Africa before from the federal government.,1,0,0,0,0,1
I believe that this party - Republican party - has stood still really for twenty-five years - its leadership has.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"He was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States; because they saw us as a society that was compassionate, that cared about people, that was moving this country ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can no longer afford to be second best.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we're on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still.",0,0,0,0,0,1
America is not standing still.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It has not been standing still.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration.,1,0,0,0,1,1
We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration.,1,1,0,0,1,1
More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.,1,0,0,0,0,0
He talks about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.,1,0,0,0,0,1
He's been in some other country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's get that straight right away.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now the second point we have to understand is this, however.",0,0,0,0,0,0
America has not been standing still.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But America cannot stand pat.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We can't stand pat because it is essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own, that we not keep just freedom for ourselves.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We had a good neighbor policy, yes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's look at it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America.,1,0,1,0,0,1
There are only three left.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Not one of them selected a Communist government.,1,0,1,0,0,1
All of them voted for freedom - a free type of government.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Does this show that Communism has the bigger pull, or freedom has the bigger pull?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're on the side of freedom.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're on the side of justice against the forces of slavery, against the forces of injustice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we aren't going to move America forward and we aren't going to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about American achievements.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead.",1,0,0,0,0,1
One other point I would make: what could you do?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Senator Kennedy and I are candidates for the presidency of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so I say in conclusion, keep America's faith strong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Mr. McGee, we have a contractual right to be in Berlin coming out of the conversations at Potsdam and of World War II.",1,0,0,0,0,0
That has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the United States; it's been reinforced by a number of other nations under NATO.,1,0,0,0,0,1
I've stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It is a commitment that we have to meet if we're going to protect the security of Western Europe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that - to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war.,1,0,0,0,0,0
I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We had a war when we came into power in 1953.,1,0,0,0,1,1
We got rid of that; we've kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesn't indicate that we're trigger-happy.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"We've been strong, but we haven't been trigger-happy.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles' press conference, I think if you read it all - and I know that you have - you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don't think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles' statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa.",1,0,1,0,0,1

"I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want.",0,1,1,0,0,1

One last point I should make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations - recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them.",0,0,1,0,0,1
One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"By the president having five powers - four or five powers - and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government.",0,1,1,0,0,1
He can set up a fact-finding committee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The fact-finding committee's powers are limited.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress.",0,0,0,0,1,1
This is a difficult and sensitive matter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now - the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn't happen.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress.",1,1,0,0,0,1
"The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession - and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars - or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh - during part of the Korean War.",0,1,1,0,0,1

We're talking about 2 weeks from now you've gotta decide who's gonna be president.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"Why, I had a great response to that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think Ross is right and that we do need some more restrictions on lobbyists.,0,0,1,0,0,0

101 in leadership is be accountable for what you do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's go back to the tax and budget summit briefly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody ever told the American people that we increased spending $1.83 for every dollar of taxes raised.,1,0,1,0,1,1
Both parties carry a huge blame for that on their shoulders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This was not a way to pay down the deficit.,0,0,1,0,0,0

Let's go back in terms of accepting responsibility for your actions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you create Saddam Hussein, over a 10-year period, using billions of dollars of US taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.",1,0,1,0,0,1

"I think at the time, the mistake that was made was signing off on the deal late on Saturday night in the middle of the night.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"I think what he should have done is gone before the American people on the front end and said listen, I made a commitment and it was wrong.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"The real mistake was the ""read my lips"" promise in the first place.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You just can't promise something like that just to get elected if you know there's a good chance that circumstances may overtake you.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You're talking about 2 different subjects.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In order to lead, you first have to use the White House as a bully pulpit and lead; then you have to develop consensus or you can't get anything done, and that's where we are now.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We can't get anything done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"How do you get anything done when you've got all of these political action committees, all of these thousands of registered lobbyists -- 40,000 registered lobbyists, 23,000 special interest groups -- and the list goes on and on and on.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And the average citizen out here is just working hard every day.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You've got to go to the people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I just love the fact that everybody, particularly in the media, goes bonkers over the town hall.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I guess it's because you will lose your right to tell them what to think.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"If you get grassroots America excited about it, and if they tap Congress on the shoulder and say do it, Charlie, it'll happen.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Now, I think that's going back to where we started.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's having a government from the people.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, I believe in the town hall meetings; they started with my campaign in New Hampshire.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think Ross Perot has done a good job in having them.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sometimes he has to act.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'd like to see those written instructions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
When I make a mistake I say I'm sorry.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Susan, I don't agree that there are no women and minorities in important positions in my campaign.",1,0,0,0,0,0

For most of my time as governor a woman was my chief of staff.,1,0,0,0,0,0
An African American was my chief cabinet officer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
An African American was my chief economic development officer.,0,0,0,0,0,1

We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions.,1,0,0,0,0,0

Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that's a fact and it's in all the newspapers.,0,0,0,0,0,1

So I say this is very simple.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, where she said we will not become involved in your border dispute and, in effect, you can take the northern part of the country.",1,0,1,0,1,1

"Let's take Mr. Bush for the moment at his word -- he's right, we don't have any evidence at least that our government did tell Saddam Hussein he could have that part of Kuwait.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And let's give him the credit he deserves for organizing Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield.,1,0,0,0,0,0
It was a remarkable event.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran -- the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"All right, the war's over; we know he's dropping mustard gas on his own people, we know he's threatened to incinerate half of Israel.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Several government departments -- several -- had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"But in late '89 the president signed a secret policy saying we were going to continue to try to improve relations with him, and we sent him some sort of communication on the eve of his invasion of Kuwait that we still wanted better relations.",1,0,1,0,0,1
So I think what was wrong -- I give credit where credit is due -- but the responsibility was in coddling Saddam Hussein when there was no reason to do it and when people at high levels in our government knew he was trying to do things that were outrageous.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, it's awful easy when you're dealing with 90-90 hindsight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations; he did have the 4th largest army.,1,0,0,0,0,1
All our Arab allies out there thought we ought to do just exactly that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when he crossed the line, I stood up and looked into the camera and I said: This aggression will not stand.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn't been one single scintilla of evidence that there's any US technology involved in it.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I cannot let that stand, because it isn't true.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"And so I just have to say, it's fine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You can't stand there, Governor Clinton, and say, well, I think I'd have been -- I have supported the minority, let sanctions work or wish it would go away -- but I would have voted with the majority.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"Gene, there is a problem in the sense that there are some problem banks, and on December 19th new regulations will go into effect which will in effect give the government the responsibility to close some banks that are not technically insolvent but that are plainly in trouble.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"On the other hand, I don't think that we have any reason to believe that the dimensions of this crisis are anywhere near as great as the savings and loan crisis.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Many people predicted what happened, and it was a disaster.",0,0,1,0,0,1
The banking system in this country is fundamentally sound with some weak banks.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"I think that our goal ought to be first of all not to politicize it, not to frighten people; secondly to say that we have to enforce the law in 2 ways.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We don't want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they've created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years -- but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble.",1,0,1,0,1,1
We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures; the taxpayers should not.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And that will be my policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I believe if we have a good balanced approach, we can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble, and not overreact.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is a serious problem, but I don't see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S&L problem was.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I don't believe it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not sound.",0,0,1,0,0,0
There are some problem banks out there.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have proposed that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when I am re-elected, I believe one of the first things ought to be to press a new Congress not beholden to the old ways to pass financial reform legislation that modernizes the banking system, doesn't put a lot of inhibitions on it, and protects the depositors through keeping the FDIC sound.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But I think that -- I just was watching some of the proceedings of the American Bankers Assn, and I think the general feeling is most of the banks are sound, certainly there's no comparison here between what happened to the S&Ls and where the banks stand right now, in my view.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, nobody's gotten into the real issue yet on the savings and loan again -- nobody's got a business background, I guess.",0,0,1,0,0,0
The whole problem came up in 1984.,1,0,1,0,0,0
The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem.,1,0,1,0,1,1

I believe the vice president was in charge of deregulation.,0,0,1,0,0,1

And they buried it till right after the election.,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem.",1,0,1,0,1,1

But just tell me now; don't bury until after the election twice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I say that to both political parties.,0,0,0,0,0,0

And it's a long list of specific items.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I picked Lloyd Bentsen, because I thought he was the best qualified person for the job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle, and before he did it, he said, watch my choice for vice president, it will tell all And it sure did.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"No, because I'm pledged to that, and yes, some taxes have gone up.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to kill it off by a tax increase.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And the way you kill expansions is to raise taxes.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And what I have proposed is something much better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is what I call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the Congress just to add on spending.,0,0,1,0,0,1
I hear this talk about a blank check.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It is the United States Congress.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And by two to one, Congress is blamed for these deficits.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And the answer is to discipline both the executive branch and the congressional branch by holding the line on taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I'm pledged to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Ann, the Vice President made that pledge.",0,0,0,0,0,1
He's broken it three times in the past year already.,1,0,0,0,1,0
So it isn't worth the paper it's printed on.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"And what I'm concerned about is that if we continue with the policies that Mr. Bush is talking about here this evening, the flexible freeze somebody described it the other day as a kind of economic slurpee he wants to spend billions on virtually every weapons system around.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"He says he's not going to raise taxes, though he has broken that pledge repeatedly.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And he's been proposing all kinds of programs for new spending costing billions.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now if we continue with these policies, this trillion and a half dollars worth of new debt that's already been added on the backs of the American taxpayer is going to increase even more, and if we continue with this for another four years, then I'm worried about the next generation, whether we can ever turn this situation around.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending",0,0,0,0,0,1
"No, I'm not sure I can promise that; I don't think either one of us can really.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There is no way of anticipating what may happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will say this: that we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit, which will require tough choices on spending; it will require a good strong rate of economic growth; it will require a plan that the president works out with the Congress doesn't blame them, works it out with them, which brings that deficit down; it will require us to go out and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid in this country.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Mr. Bush says we are going to put the IRS on every taxpayer.,1,0,0,0,1,1
That's not what we are going to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm for the taxpayer bill of rights.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I think it's unconscionable, Ann, that we should be talking or thinking about imposing new taxes on average Americans when there are billions out there, over $100 billion, in taxes owed that aren't being paid.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Senator Bentsen said, as you recall at the debate with Senator Quayle, that if you give any of us $200 billion worth of hot checks a year, we can create an illusion of prosperity.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn't going to work.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He has raised taxes several times.,1,1,0,0,1,1
"I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"(Applause) I'd like to have that line-item veto for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily helpful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund.,1,0,1,0,1,1
(Applause) And so I'm still a little unclear as to whether he's for or against the tax increase.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I have been for the taxpayer bill of rights all along.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And this idea of unleashing a whole bunch-an army, a conventional force army, of IRS agents into everybody's kitchen I mean, he's against most defense matters, and now he wants to get an army of JRS auditors going out there.",0,0,1,0,1,1
(Laughter) I'm against that; I oppose that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I don't know if the vice president agrees with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Margaret, may I go back and just say to the vice president that I didn't raid the pension fund of Massachusetts you are dead wrong, George, we didn't do that.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"(Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I won the Democratic nomination in fifty-one separate contests.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think I'm a reasonably likable guy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"(Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I'm also a serious guy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, we have just heard two or three times from the vice president: he's not going to raise taxes.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"I repeat, within days after you made that pledge, you broke it; you said, well, maybe as a last resort we'll do it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You've got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world and we can't turn it over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I know these campaigns get knocked a lot, but I think I'd be a better President now for having had to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What was he referring to?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think my dad would be pretty proud of me, because I think we've come a long long way and I think, you know three months ago, I remember some of the great publications in this country had written me off.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what I've had to do is define, not just my position, but to define his and I hope I've done it fairly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the reason I've had to do that is that he ran on the left in the Democratic primary, ran firmly and ran with conviction and ran on his record.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And in the process the negatives began.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It wasn't me that was there at that convention.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm not the one that compared the President of the United States rotting from like a dead fish from the head down.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"He's the one that brought up, to garner primary votes, the whole question of the ACLU.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not on their defending some minority opinion on the right or the left.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But what I don't like is this left wing political agenda and therefore I have to help define that and if he's unwilling to do it, if he says ideology doesn't matter, I don't agree with him.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, Margaret, we've heard it again tonight and I'm not surprised, the labels.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I guess the Vice President two or three times, said I was coming from the left.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"In 1980, President Reagan called you a liberal for voting for Federal gun control.",1,0,1,0,0,0
And this is something Republicans have used for a long time.,1,0,0,0,0,0
They tried it with Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We've always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the kind of America I want.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's nothing the matter with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's stop labeling each other and lets' get to the heart of the matter which is the future of this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought were purely waste and weren't protected by the Congress, they wouldn't be in the budget.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"They would not be in the budget, but you want one now?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'll give you one, that HMET, that heavy truck, that's cost what is it $850 million and the Pentagon didn't request it and, yet, a member of Congress, a very powerful one, put it in the budget.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"I think we can save money through this whole very sophisticated concept, Andrea, that I know you do understand of competitive strategies.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is new and it is very very different than what's happened, but it's not quite ready to be totally implemented.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think we can say, through the Packard Commission Report and I'm very proud that David Packard, the originator of that report, is strongly supporting me.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So, it's not a question of saying our budget is full of a lot of waste.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks.,1,0,1,0,0,1
And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My Secretary of Defense is going to have to make a very difficult decision in which system to go forward with.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we are protecting both of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We have to have modernization, especially if we achieve the 50 percent reduction in strategic weapons that our President is taking the leadership to attain.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And, so, that's the way I'd reply to it and I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies and if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why the Vice President's mathematics just don't add up.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think you know because you've covered these issues, that there's no way that we can build all of the weapons the Vice President says he wants to build within the defense budget.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Everybody knows that including the people at the Pentagon.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We are not going to spend the billions and trillions that Mr. Bush wants to spend on Star Wars.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"We're not going to spend billions on MX's on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we don't need, can't afford and won't help our defense posture at all.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We're going to go forward with the Stealth and the D-5 and the advance cruise missile and good conventional forces.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the next President of the United States will have to make some tough and difficult decisions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm prepared to make them, the Vice President is not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea.",1,0,1,0,1,1
That's an incredibly powerful nuclear deterrent.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I don't rule out modernization, and there are discussions going on now in the Congress, I know with the Pentagon, about a less expensive modernized land-based leg of the triad.",0,0,1,0,0,1
But there are limits to what we can spend.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are limits to this nation's ability to finance these weapons systems.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And one of the things that the Vice President either ignores or won't address is the fact that you can't divorce our military security from our economic security.,0,0,1,0,0,0
How can we build a strong America militarily that's teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to have conventional forces that are well maintained, well equipped, well trained, well supported.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why I say again to all of you out there who have to deal with your household budgets and know how difficult it is that the next President has to do the same.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We cannot continue to tell the American people that we're going to build all of these systems, and at the same time, invest in important things here at home, and be serious about building a strong and good America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the kind of America I want to build.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the foremost (Applause),0,0,0,0,0,0
I held off for the applause.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Governor talks about limits, what we can't do, opposes these two modernization systems, talks now about well, we'll develop some new kind of a missile.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"It takes eight years, ten years, to do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He talked about a nuclear freeze back at the time when I was in Europe trying to convince European public opinion that we ought to go forward with the deployment of the INF weapons.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"And thank God, the freeze people were not heard.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.,1,1,1,0,1,1
You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"World peace is important, and we have enhanced the peace.",1,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But there are many people who I admire in this country today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I think of those young athletes who represented us at the Olympics were tremendously impressive.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We felt strongly about them, and they did so well by us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Members of the clergy who have done the same.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So there are many, many heroes in this country today.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think of a teacher right here, largely Hispanic school, Jaime Escalante, teaching calculus to young kids, 80 percent of them going on to college.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"I think of a young man now in this country named Villadaris, who was released from a Cuban jail.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Came out and told the truth in this brilliant book, Against All Hope, about what is actually happening in Cuba.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think of those people that took us back into space again, Rick Houk and that crew, as people that are worthy of this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with the Governor on athletics.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think of Dr. Fauci.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Probably never heard of him.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You did, Ann heard of him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He's a very fine research, top doctor, at the National Institute of Health, working hard doing something about research on this disease of AIDS.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But look, I also think we ought to give a little credit to the President of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"And he is leaving office with a popularity at an all-time high, because American people",1,0,0,0,1,0
"say, he is our hero.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, let me tell you something about that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I'm saying to Barbara, you know, we've always kept family as a bit of an oasis for us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You all know me, and we've held it back a little.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we used that as a role model, the way he took understandable pride in his heritage, what his family means to him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've got a strong family.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we said, hey, we've got to unleash the Bush kids.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And so you saw ten grandchildren there jumping all over their grandfather at the convention.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You see our five kids, all over this country, and their spouses.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I would say, I don't know whether that's kind or not, it's just an objective statement.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because it's gotten a little ugly out there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's gotten a little nasty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not much fun sometimes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I would cite again Dan Quayle.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've been in politics a long time, and I don't remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly rumor that never was true, printed.",0,0,1,0,0,0
So some of it is unfair.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But he's in the arena.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Teddy Roosevelt used to talk about the arena, you know, daring to fail greatly or succeed, no matter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I salute these things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sam Raybum had a great expression on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He said here were all these intellectuals out there griping and complaining and saying it was negative coverage.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Rayburn says, yeah, and that guy never ran for sheriff either.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"Michael Dukakis has run for sheriff, and so has George Bush.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"I didn't hear the word ""liberal"" or ""left"" one time.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I thank you for that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And doesn't that prove the point, George, which is that values like family and education and community, decent homes for young people that family on Long Island I visited on Monday where Lou and Betty Tolamo (phonetic) bought a house for some $19,000 back in 1962, have had seven children, they're all making good livings.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They can't live in the community which they grew up in.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Those are basic American values.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you believe in them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're not left or right.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We may think that you deal with them in different ways.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But they're basically American, I believe in them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
George Bush believes in them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the vast majority of Americans believe in them.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I think the American people would appreciate that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because you left out one other exception, the health of the mother.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me answer your question and I hope it doesn't get too personal or maudlin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"I was over running records in west Texas, and I got a call from her, come home; went to the doctor; the doctor said, beautiful child, your child has a few weeks to live.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And I said, what can we do about it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We took the child to New York.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And so I don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think human life is very, very precious.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, look, this hasn't been an easy decision for me to meet.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know others disagree with it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But when I was in that little church across the river from Washington and saw our grandchild christened in our faith, I was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that child, and put the child up for adoption.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Margaret, Kitty and I had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes had: we lost a baby, lived about twenty minutes after it was born.",0,0,0,0,1,0

"It's who makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision?",0,0,1,0,0,0

"It's an example of how oftentimes we may be associated with organizations all of whose particular positions we don't support, even though we support in general the hope that over time, particularly if we can get those reductions in strategic weapons, if we can get a comprehensive test ban treaty, if we can negotiate with the Soviet Union and bring down the level of conventional forces in Europe with deeper cuts in the Soviet side, yes, at some point it may be possible to reduce defense outlays and use those for important things here at home, like jobs and job training and college opportunity and health and housing and the environment and the things that all of us care about.",0,0,0,0,0,1

And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I also see a tremendous opportunity now to negotiate with the Soviet Union to build on the progress that we've made with the INF Treaty, which I strongly supported and most Democrats did to get those reductions in strategic weapons, to get a test ban treaty, and to really make progress on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So I hope that we can begin to move those resources.,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is a big question.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I said I would have the Secretary of Defense sit down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But while the President is negotiating with the Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.,0,0,1,0,0,1

"Andrea, why do people who want balanced budgets or to bring the deficit down always go to those programs which tend to benefit people of very modest means?",0,0,1,0,0,1
And yet Mr. Bush tried to cut their cost of living increase in 1985.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"Medicare is not getting less expensive; medical care for the elderly is getting more expensive, with greater deductibles, with fewer benefits, the kinds of things we've had under this Administration that have cut and chopped and reduced the kind of benefits that one gets under Medicare.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it's going to cost, and that's going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It had bipartisan support; it should have had bipartisan support.,1,0,0,0,0,0
But I suggest that we understand that those are going to be additional costs on senior citizens across this country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So I'm not going to begin, and I'm not going to go to entitlements as a means for cutting that deficit when we're spending billions on something like Star Wars, when we're spending billions on other weapon systems which apparently the Vice President wants to keep in his back pocket or some place, but which, if we continue to spend billions on them, will force us to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare, to cut these basic entitlements to people of very, very modest means.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance.,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's the way you bring a deficit down and help to improve the quality of life for people at the same time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think I've addressed it.,0,0,0,0,0,0

First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Here a very small investment of taxpayer's money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"Another thing is to deal with our - uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don't speak English, or who're black, or young people, or - 40 percent of the employment.",1,0,0,1,1,1
Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.,0,1,0,0,0,1
"Another very important - uh aspect of our - uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down - uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"These uh - kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in - in reducing uh unemployment.",0,1,0,0,0,0

In a > Transfer interrupted!,0,1,0,0,0,0
"ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job - job - uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people - uh and also sharing with uh - local governments the uh - payment of salaries which would uh - let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level.",0,1,1,1,0,1
"But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh - of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh - 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about - uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?",0,0,0,0,0,1
Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I would not favor the uh - payment of uh - of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work.,0,1,1,1,0,1
But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh - income levels uh - above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh - profitable than - than work.,0,1,1,0,0,1
I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh - we all know that it would've controlled our economy, it would've added uh - ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"It would've called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector.,1,1,0,1,1,1
"We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business.",1,1,0,0,1,1
"I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures - a one-for-one proposition.",1,1,0,0,1,1
"And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption - money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn't have to spend.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can - with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending.",1,0,0,0,0,1
For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.,1,1,0,1,1,1
We can't afford that kind of growth in federal spending.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.,1,1,0,0,0,1
"With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"I think the Congress should have uh - added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended.",1,0,0,0,1,1
So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now this tax bill - that hasn't reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two - it's about fifteen hundred pages.",1,0,0,0,1,1

"It has - uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately.",0,1,0,1,0,0

"In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation.",1,1,1,1,1,1

"If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term.",1,1,1,1,0,1
Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,1

I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"If it is uh true that there will be a $60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981, rather than spend that money for all the new programs that Governor Carter recommends and endorses, and which are included in the Democratic platform, I think the American taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break - a tax reduction of that magnitude.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers.",1,0,0,0,1,1

"We expected one at the time of the Vietnam War, but it was used up before we ever ended the war and taxpayers never got the adequate relief they deserved.",1,0,1,0,0,1
The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.,1,0,0,0,0,1
About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.,1,0,0,0,0,1

The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, Mr. Carter has uh indicated that uh - he would give a blanket pardon to all uh - draft evaders.",1,1,1,1,0,0
I do not agree with that point of view.,0,0,1,0,0,0

Amnesty means that - that you uh - that what you did was right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Pardon means that what you did, whether it's right or wrong, you're forgiven for it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I think it's accurate to say that in uh - two years ago when Mr. Nixon - Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh - excused as were - as were the uh - the ones who evaded the draft.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished.",0,1,1,1,1,1
"And - and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is - is what - uh - is a - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and this is something that hasn't been addressed adequately by - by this administration.",0,1,1,0,0,1
But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"Well, I've been through this before, Mr. Gannon, as the governor of Georgia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict.",1,1,1,1,1,1
And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.,1,1,0,1,1,0
We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them.,1,0,0,0,0,1
We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It hasn't been undone since I was there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and - and a clear assignment of responsibility and - and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government.",1,1,0,0,0,0
I intend to do the same thing if I'm elected president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that - that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the - of the executive branch of government.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We now have uh - a greatly expanded White House staff.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on - on the White House and its staff.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration.",1,1,1,0,1,1
This needs to be changed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, we now have uh - in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this.",1,1,0,1,0,1
Medicaid's in one agency; Medicare is in a different one.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one.,0,1,0,0,0,0
None of them uh are responsible for health care itself.,0,1,0,0,0,0
This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have uh - just advocated uh - this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy.,1,1,0,1,0,0
Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government.",1,1,0,0,0,1
"This is a - a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I'm elected - and I intend to be - then it's gonna be done.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I can't say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in.,0,0,0,0,1,1
It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year.",1,1,0,1,1,1
But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, we uh - completely revised our prison system.",0,1,1,1,1,0
We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services.,1,0,0,0,0,0
The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments.,1,1,1,1,0,0
"For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh - we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees.",1,1,0,1,1,1
"In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"If we don't, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue.",0,0,1,0,0,0
There's no way for our people now to understand what their government is.,0,0,1,0,0,0
There's no way to get the answer to a question.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program.",1,1,0,0,0,1
This is the kind of change that would be made.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And uh - it would be of - of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers' money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent.",1,1,0,1,1,1
"And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter's successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh - months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"He testified, and these are his words - the present governor of Georgia - he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles.",1,1,0,1,1,1
Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.,1,0,0,0,1,1
And in the term that I've been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand.,1,1,0,0,1,1
"In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we've made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, in the uh - last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment.",1,1,0,1,1,1
"But in the last uh - twenty-four months we've turned the economy around and we've brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country.",1,1,0,1,0,1
The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And I think we'll have some decrease in our disbursements.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase, as I recommended, over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars, doubling our national park system.",0,1,0,0,0,1
We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments.,1,0,0,0,0,1
But that doesn't cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"We - uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years.",1,1,1,1,0,1
That doesn't cost any more money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We believe that you can uhh - do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program.,0,1,0,0,0,0
We feel that uh - in education we can have a slight increase - not a major increase.,0,1,0,1,0,0
It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned.,1,1,1,0,0,1
At the present time we're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars.,1,1,0,0,1,1
I don't know where that money would come from.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We feel that uh - with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality-of-life area, we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh - calendar year this year - something slightly under 6 percent.,0,1,0,1,1,1
"Employment will be up, revenues will be up.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh - Governor Carter recommends.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"He endorses the Democratic uh - platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs.",1,1,0,1,1,1
We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars - uhh maximum each year to the federal budget.,1,1,0,1,1,1
Those programs you cannot afford and give tax relief.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending, give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Mr. Ford takes the uh - same attitude that the Republicans always take.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"In the last three months before an election, they're always for the programs that they always fight the other three-and-one-half years.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Uh - I remember when uh - Herbert Hoover was against uh - jobs for people.,1,1,1,1,0,0
"I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh - later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy's proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost.",1,0,1,0,1,1
The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"We've got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford's been in office two years, we've had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million.",1,0,1,0,1,1
We've also got uh - a comparison between himself and Mr. Nixon.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He's got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"This uh - talking about more people at work - uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh - two years, it means that - that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn't want to because their fathers didn't make enough to pay the increased cost of uh - food and uh housing and clothing.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we've had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we've had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars.",1,1,1,1,1,1
This is the kind of record that's there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn't go.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I think I know the - the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power.,0,1,0,0,0,0
But the energy - uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration.,1,1,1,1,0,1
I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"We have seen uh - the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance.",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Uh - in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it's permanent, it's enormous, it's growing every day.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence.,1,0,1,0,0,1
We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"In addition to that, we need to have - uh a realization that we've got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world.",1,1,0,0,0,1
We're gonna run out of oil.,0,0,1,0,0,0
When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil.,1,1,0,0,1,1
Now we've increased that amount 25 percent.,1,0,0,0,1,1
We now import about 44 percent of our oil.,1,0,0,0,1,1
We need to shift from oil to coal.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it's clean burning.",0,1,0,0,0,1
We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I would certainly uh - not cut out atomic power altogether.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core - below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh - power tightly sealed and a heavy - heavy vacuum maintained.",0,1,1,0,0,1
There ought to be a standardized design.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There ought to be a full-time uh - atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh - put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions.",0,1,1,0,0,1
That's the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We uh - now encourage people to waste electricity, and uh - by giving uh - the lowest rates to the biggest users.",1,1,0,1,0,1
We don't do anything to cut down on peak load requirements.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And whenever the uh - automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can't meet the uh - amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"In addition to that, we ought to have a - a shift toward the use of coal, particularly in the Appalachian regions where the coal is located.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"A lot of uh - very high quality, low-carbon coal, uh - low-sulfur coal is there, it's where our employment is needed.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Uh - this would - would help a great deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So mandatory conservation measures - yes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes.,0,1,0,0,0,0
And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One bank in uh - Washington, fo- for instance, gives lower interest loans for people who adequately insulate their homes or who buy efficient automobiles.",1,1,1,1,0,1
"And some major uh - uh - manufacturing companies, like Dow Chemical, have through uh - very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by uh - as much as 40 percent with the same out-product.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"These kinds of things uh - ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In January of uh - 1975 I submitted to the Congress and to the American people the first comprehensive energy program recommended by any president.,0,1,0,0,0,1
It called for an increase in the production of energy in the United States.,1,0,0,0,1,1
It called for uh - conservation measures so that we would save the energy that we have.,0,1,0,0,0,0
If you're going to increase domestic oil and gas production - and we have to - you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh - develop their land or their wells.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I recommended to the Congress that we should increase production in this country from six hundred million tons a year to twel- a- a billion two hundred million tons by 1985.,1,1,0,0,0,1
"In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner.",0,0,0,0,0,1
In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.,0,1,0,1,0,0
"In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year.",1,1,0,0,0,1
We're going as fast as the experts say we should.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"I think you have to have greater oil and gas production, more coal production, more nuclear production, and in addition you have to have energy conservation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.,1,1,1,1,1,1
Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh - be made available.,1,1,1,0,0,1
Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"In addition, the jobs would not be available right now.",1,1,1,0,0,1
They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months.,0,0,0,0,1,1
The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.,0,0,0,0,0,1
What we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months.",1,1,0,0,0,1
"We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We've added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months.,1,1,0,0,0,1
Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think it's uh - also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh - added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"It's my - my opinion that the private sector, where five out of six jobs are, where you have permanent jobs, with the opportunity for advancement, is a better place than make-work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress.",1,1,0,0,0,1
"Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"But that is an extra $4 billion that would uh - add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressures, which would help to destroy jobs in the private sector - not make jobs, where the jobs really are.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people.",0,1,1,0,0,1
I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Now Governor Carter complains about the deficits that uh - uh - this administration has had.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has - that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion.,1,0,1,0,1,1
Now he can't have it both ways.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And therefore, it seems to me that we should hold the lid, as we have, to the best of our ability so we can stimulate the private economy and get the jobs where the jobs are - five out of six in this economy.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip.",0,0,0,1,0,1
"And I said, ""How many uh - adults here are out of work?""",0,0,0,0,0,0
About a thousand raised their hands.,1,0,0,0,1,1
Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office.,1,0,1,0,1,1
And still he talks about - uh success.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country.,1,1,1,0,1,1
He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We've got the highest inflation we've had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"And we've got uh - the highest unemployment we've had uh - under Mr. Ford's administration, since the Great Depression.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration.",0,0,1,0,0,0
He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes.,1,0,1,0,1,1
There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives, and then it's covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation.",1,0,1,0,0,1
It shows a lack of leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills.,1,0,1,0,1,1
Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - per year.,1,0,1,0,1,1
And eleven of 'em have been overridden.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"One of his bills that was overridden - he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace - ah of all the tax - benefits now, 25 percent of 'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Over 50 percent - 53 to be exact - percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and we've had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago.",1,1,0,1,1,1
"Mr. Ford has - has advocated since he's been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income - not from labor - but from investments.",1,1,1,0,1,1
That's got to be changed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas - if they make a million dollars in profits overseas - they don't have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"When they don't pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don't have to pay any taxes on the money.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them.",1,1,1,1,1,1
This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"And when those rich corporations don't pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for 'em.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Another one that's uh - that's very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch.",0,0,1,0,0,1

"Uh - another system is where uhh - a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh - can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars - nine hundred mi- thousand dollars - that makes a million - and mark off a great amount of uh - of loss uh - through that procedure.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Uh - there was one example, for instance, where uh - somebody uh - produced pornographic movies.",0,1,1,1,0,1
They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"Well, these special kinds of programs have - have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh - eight thousand pages of the tax code.",1,1,1,1,0,1
The average uh American person can't do it.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"These programs that I described to you earlier - the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh - they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it.",1,0,0,0,0,1
It's to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle-income families.,0,0,0,0,0,1

I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They have been short-changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years, and as we have uh - added to the minimum tax uh - provision to make all people pay more taxes.",1,1,0,1,1,1

"And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is no question that we face this massive deficit, and almost everybody agrees unless we get it down, the chances for long-term, healthy growth are nil.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.,0,0,1,0,0,0
The President says it will disappear overnight because of some reason.,1,0,1,0,0,1
No one else believes that's the case.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"The first time -- and I did not criticize the President, because these things can happen -- once, and sometimes twice -- the second time the barracks in Lebanon were assaulted, as we all remember.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves.",1,0,1,0,0,1

"It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am answering your questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think we're getting better all the time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, having that, I think also that in leadership -- well, I believe that you find people, positions such as I'm in who have the talent and ability to do the things that are needed in the various departments of government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I also believe something else about that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I believe that -- and when I became Governor of California, I started this, and I continue it in this office -- that any issue that comes before me, I have instructed Cabinet members and staff they are not to bring up any of the political ramifications that might surround the issue.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I don't want to hear them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Our policy was not to cut subsidies.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"We have believed in partnership, and that was an example of a partnership between, not only local government and the Federal Government but also between the private sector that built that particular structure.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And this is what we've been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have preserved the safety net for the people with true need in this country, and it has been pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable programs or many of them for the people who have real need.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said, ""It's not what he doesn't know that bothers me; it's what he knows for sure that just ain't so.''",0,0,0,0,0,0
[Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent.,1,0,1,0,1,1
It's not an opinion; it's a fact.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when the President was asked the other day, ""What do you want to cut in the budget?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"'', he said, ""Cut those things I asked for but didn't get.''",1,0,0,0,0,0
That's Social Security and Medicare.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The second fact is that the housing unit for senior citizens that the President dedicated in Buffalo was only made possible through a Federal assistance program for senior citizens that the President's budget sought to terminate.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This administration has taken a meat cleaver out, in terms of Federal-assisted housing, and the record is there.",0,0,0,0,1,1
We have to see the facts before we can draw conclusions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me just respond with regard to Social Security.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we took office, we discovered that the program that the Carter-Mondale administration had said would solve the fiscal problems of Social Security for the next 50 years wouldn't solve them for 5.",0,0,1,0,1,1
Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"Any proposals that I made at that time were at the request of the chairman, a Democrat, of one of the leading committees, who said we have to do something before the program goes broke and the checks bounce.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"And so, we made a proposal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And then I asked for a bipartisan commission, which I'd asked for from the beginning, to sit down and work out a solution.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, I was raised to have a faith and a belief and have been a member of a church since I was a small boy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In our particular church, we did not use that term, ""born again,'' so I don't know whether I would fit that -- that particular term.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"But I have -- thanks to my mother, God rest her soul -- the firmest possible belief and faith in God.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I do resort to prayer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So, it does play a part in my life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have no hesitancy in saying so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The answer to your question is very simple about why I don't go to church.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And now, in the position I hold and in the world in which we live, where Embassies do get blown up in Beirut -- we're supposed to talk about that on the debate the 21st, I understand -- but I pose a threat to several hundred people if I go to church.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I know the threats that are made against me.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And, therefore, I don't feel -- and my minister knows this and supports me in this position -- I don't feel that I have a right to go to church, knowing that my being there could cause something of the kind that we have seen in other places, in Beirut, for example.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact.",0,0,0,0,0,0
My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I believe I have sung at more weddings and more funerals than anybody ever to seek the Presidency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whether that helps or not, I don't know.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a deep religious faith.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's probably the reason that I'm in politics.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we're all together on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one's own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others' faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others.",0,0,1,0,0,0
All history tells us that that's a mistake.,0,0,1,0,0,1
This nation is the most religious nation on Earth -- more people go to church and synagogues than any other nation on Earth -- and it's because we kept the politicians and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith.,1,0,0,0,0,1
That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The fact that the faith speaks to us and that we are moral people, hopefully, I accept and rejoice in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political -- or private religious faith and the use of the state is where -- for the most personal decisions in American life -- that's where I draw the line.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The only attacks I have made are on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side, using the government, using the power of the courts and so forth to hinder that part of the Constitution that says the government shall not only not establish a religion, it shall not inhibit the practice of religion.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion.",1,0,1,0,1,1
A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have appointed one member to the Supreme Court: Sandra Day O'Connor.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I'll stand on my record on that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And Jerry Falwell says that means we get two or three judges.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Let's take the example that the President cites.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Who would write the prayer?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?,0,0,0,0,0,0
My answer is that this campaign isn't over yet.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And when people vote, I think you're going to see a very strong verdict by the American people that they favor the approach that I'm talking about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The American people want arms control.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They don't want this arms race.,0,0,1,0,1,0

"And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"And they know this debt must come down as well, because it's unfair to our children.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The American people want this environment protected.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They know that these toxic waste dumps should have been cleaned up a long time ago, and they know that people's lives and health are being risked, because we've had an administration that has been totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment.",1,0,1,0,1,1
The American people want their children educated.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They want those civil rights laws enforced.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They want the equal rights amendment ratified.,0,0,0,0,1,1
They want equal pay for comparable effort for women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they want it because they've understood from the beginning that when we open doors, we're all stronger, just as we were at the Olympics.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The President says it'll disappear automatically.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I've said it's going to take some work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, I've said that I will not support the cuts in Social Security and Medicare and the rest that the President has proposed.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"The President answers that it didn't happen or, if it did, it was resolved later in a commission.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, again, I'm running on the record.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We'll continue to try to get things that we didn't get in a program that has already brought the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent, a program of returning authority and autonomy to the local and State governments that has been unjustly seized by the Federal Government.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And you might find those words in a Democratic platform of some years ago -- I know, because I was a Democrat at that time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I left the party eventually, because I could no longer follow the turn in the Democratic leadership that took us down an entirely different path, a path of centralizing authority in the Federal Government, lacking trust in the American people.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"I promised, when we took office, that we would reduce inflation.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"We have, to one-third of what it was.",1,0,0,0,0,1
I promised that we would reduce taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We did, 25 percent across the board.",1,0,0,0,0,0
That barely held even with -- if it did that much -- with the gigantic tax increase imposed in 1977.,1,0,1,0,0,1
But at least it took that burden away from them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I think this is something the American people see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.,1,0,1,0,0,1
All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"There are tasks that government legitimately should enforce and tasks that government performs well, and you've named some of them.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program -- but it's just about finished already -- a billion dollars.",1,0,1,1,1,1
And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"I think that we're out in front of most -- and I see that the red light is blinking, so I can't continue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The President says that when the Democratic Party made its turn, he left it.",1,0,0,0,0,1
The year that he decided we had lost our way was the year that John F. Kennedy was running against Richard Nixon.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"I was chairman of ""Minnesotans for Kennedy;'' President Reagan was chairman of a thing called ""Democrats for Nixon.''",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, maybe we made a wrong turn with Kennedy, but I'll be proud of supporting him all of my life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The President just said that his government is shrinking.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's where government should not be.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And so, my change had come earlier than that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I hadn't gotten around to reregistering as yet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I found that was rather difficult to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I finally did it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are some other things that have been said here -- back, and you said that I might be able to dredge them up.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Mr. Mondale referred to the farmers' worst year.,0,1,0,0,0,1
The farmers are not the victims of anything this administration has done.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 211/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"All of these things are presently being rectified, and I think that we are going to salvage the farmers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have believed that in the appointment of judges that all that was specified in the party platform was that they respect the sanctity of human life.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of prolife.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, isn't it strange that that same woman could have taken the life of her unborn child, and it was abortion and not murder, but if somebody else does it, that's murder?",0,0,1,0,1,1

The laws regarding that always were State laws.,1,0,0,0,0,1
It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.,1,0,0,0,1,1

"But what he has said is that, even knowing there were no weapons of mass destruction, even knowing there was no imminent threat, even knowing there was no connection with Al Qaida, he would still have done everything the same way.",1,0,1,0,1,1

"So the choice for America is, you can have a plan that I've laid out in four points, each of which I can tell you more about or you can go to johnkerry.com and see more of it; or you have the president's plan, which is four words: more of the same.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think my plan is better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And my plan has a better chance of standing up and fighting for those troops.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Yes, I understand what it means to the commander in chief.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"I said, if we do the things that I've set out and we are successful, we could begin to draw the troops down in six months.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I will make a flat statement: The United States of America has no long-term designs on staying in Iraq.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And our goal in my administration would be to get all of the troops out of there with a minimal amount you need for training and logistics as we do in some other countries in the world after a war to be able to sustain the peace.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But that's how we're going to win the peace, by rapidly training the Iraqis themselves.",0,0,0,0,0,0

You can't change the dynamics on the ground if you've criticized the brave leader of Iraq.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"The national intelligence assessment that was given to the president in July said, best-case scenario, more of the same of what we see today; worst-case scenario, civil war.",1,0,1,0,0,1
The reason why Prime Minister Allawi said they're coming across the border is because he recognizes that this is a central part of the war on terror.,1,0,0,0,0,1

That's the enemy that attacked us.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That's the enemy that was allowed to walk out of those mountains.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits.",1,0,1,0,0,1
He also said Saddam Hussein would have been stronger.,1,0,1,0,0,0
That is just factually incorrect.,1,0,1,0,0,0

"He had the capability of making weapons, and he would have made weapons.",0,0,0,0,1,0
Thirty-five to forty countries in the world had a greater capability of making weapons at the moment the president invaded than Saddam Hussein.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"And while he's been diverted, with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our Army, either going to Iraq, coming back from Iraq, or getting ready to go, North Korea's gotten nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous.",1,0,1,0,1,1

Let me say -- I certainly hope so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Before I was sworn in, the policy of this government was to have bilateral negotiations with North Korea.",1,0,0,0,1,1

Secretary Bill Perry negotiated that under President Clinton.,1,0,0,0,0,1

That's exactly what Kim Jong Il wants.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by the way, the breach on the agreement was not through plutonium.",0,1,1,0,1,1
The breach on the agreement is highly enriched uranium.,1,1,1,0,1,1

That's where he was breaking the agreement.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"Secondly, he said -- my opponent said where he worked to put sanctions on Iran -- we've already sanctioned Iran.",1,0,1,0,1,1
We can't sanction them any more.,0,0,1,0,0,0
There are sanctions in place on Iran.,1,0,1,0,1,1

"And months ago, many of us were pressing for action.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I think the reason that we're not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support.,1,0,0,0,0,0
We need to do more than that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's going to require more than is on the table today.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Ask the people in the armed forces today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.,1,0,0,0,0,1

So this is the way the president has overextended the United States.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"That's why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe.",0,0,0,0,0,1

I admire the fact that he served for 20 years in the Senate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Although I'm not so sure I admire the record.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I won't hold it against him that he went to Yale.,0,0,1,0,1,0

"He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our troops.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Mixed messages send the wrong signals to our allies.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Mixed messages send the wrong signals to the Iraqi citizens.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Well, first of all, I appreciate enormously the personal comments the president just made.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I share them with him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think only if you're doing this -- and he's done it more than I have in terms of the presidency -- can you begin to get a sense of what it means to your families.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so I acknowledge that his daughters -- I've watched them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've chuckled a few times at some of their comments.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm trying to put a leash on them.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I've learned not to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
... and a great first lady.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we do have differences.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not going to talk about a difference of character.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think that's my job or my business.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But let me talk about something that the president just sort of finished up with.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Maybe someone would call it a character trait, maybe somebody wouldn't.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But this issue of certainty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's another to be certain and be right, or to be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I worry about with the president is that he's not acknowledging what's on the ground, he's not acknowledging the realities of North Korea, he's not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem-cell research or of global warming and other issues.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think -- listen, I fully agree that one should shift tactics, and we will, in Iraq.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our commanders have got all the flexibility to do what is necessary to succeed.,1,0,0,0,0,0
But what I won't do is change my core values because of politics or because of pressure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it is one of the things I've learned in the White House, is that there's enormous pressure on the president, and he cannot wilt under that pressure.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I have no intention of wilting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've never wilted in my life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I've never wavered in my life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I know exactly what we need to do in Iraq, and my position has been consistent: Saddam Hussein is a threat.",0,0,1,0,0,0
He needed to be disarmed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We needed to go to the U.N.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The president needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something, because he never did it without the threat of force.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But we didn't need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"At the rate that the president is currently securing it, it'll take 13 years to get it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I did a lot of work on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I wrote a book about it several years ago -- six, seven years ago -- called ""The New War,"" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And back then, we intercepted a suitcase in a Middle Eastern country with nuclear materials in it.",1,0,1,0,1,1

"Now, there are terrorists trying to get their hands on that stuff today.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11.",1,0,1,0,1,1
We have to do this job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And to do the job, you can't cut the money for it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The president actually cut the money for it.,1,0,1,0,1,1
You have to put the money into it and the funding and the leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Right now the president is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to research bunker-busting nuclear weapons.,1,0,1,0,1,1
The United States is pursuing a new set of nuclear weapons.,1,0,1,0,1,1
You talk about mixed messages.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're telling other people, ""You can't have nuclear weapons,"" but we're pursuing a new nuclear weapon that we might even contemplate using.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"I'm going to shut that program down, and we're going to make it clear to the world we're serious about containing nuclear proliferation.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And we're going to get the job of containing all of that nuclear material in Russia done in four years.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And we're going to build the strongest international network to prevent nuclear proliferation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the scale of what President Kennedy set out to do with the nuclear test ban treaty.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And I intend to get it done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, we've set up what's called the -- well, first of all, I agree with my opponent that the biggest threat facing this country is weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terrorist network.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And that's why proliferation is one of the centerpieces of a multi-prong strategy to make the country safer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
My administration started what's called the Proliferation Security Initiative.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Over 60 nations involved with disrupting the trans-shipment of information and/or weapons of mass destruction materials.,0,0,1,0,0,1
This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya.,1,0,1,0,1,1
We convinced Libya to disarm.,1,0,1,0,1,0
It's a central part of dealing with weapons of mass destruction and proliferation.,0,0,1,0,0,1
I'll tell you another way to help protect America in the long run is to continue with missile defenses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've got a robust research and development program that has been ongoing during my administration.,1,0,0,0,0,0
We'll be implementing a missile-defense system relatively quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is another way to help deal with the threats that we face in the 21st century.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I'm going to do it in four years, and I'm going to immediately set out to have bilateral talks with North Korea.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, I can't tell you how big a mistake I think that is, to have bilateral talks with North Korea.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It's precisely what Kim Jong Il wants.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It will cause the six-party talks to evaporate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It will mean that China no longer is involved in convincing, along with us, for Kim Jong Il to get rid of his weapons.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It's a big mistake to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We must have China's leverage on Kim Jong Il, besides ourselves.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think that'll work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, he's sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesn't believe in checks and balances, and I told him that.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror.",0,0,1,0,0,0

That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I've got a good relation with Vladimir.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I found that, in this world, that it's important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you're able to disagree in a way that is effective.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And so I've told him my opinion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Russia is a country in transition.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, let me just say quickly that I've had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia, because I was there right after the transformation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I was probably one of the first senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former senator, to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them.",1,0,1,0,1,1
It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I regret what's happened in these past months.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations.,1,0,1,0,0,1
His political opposition is being put in jail.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"And I think it's very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a very important country to us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we always have to stand up for democracy.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Just because the president says it can't be done, that you'd lose China, doesn't mean it can't be done.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"I mean, this is the president who said ""There were weapons of mass destruction,"" said ""Mission accomplished,"" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true.",1,0,1,0,1,1
We could have bilateral talks with Kim Jong Il.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we can get those weapons at the same time as we get China.,0,0,0,0,0,1

You know my opinion on North Korea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can't say it any more plainly.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't take it personally.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole's been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldn't work at the time.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund.",1,0,0,1,1,1
It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed.",1,0,1,0,1,1

"Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I must say, I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965, we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it.",1,0,0,0,0,1
I thought it was a good program.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I've supported Medicare ever since.,1,0,0,0,0,0

I think it's time to have a truce.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me say, first of all, I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the '83 Social Security commission.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it won't be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says he'll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed.",1,0,1,0,1,1
I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system.,1,0,1,0,0,1
My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.,1,0,0,0,0,1

It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans.",1,0,1,0,1,1
It's not good to raise the deficit.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We worked too hard to lower it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year.",1,0,0,0,1,1

But it seemed to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You're putting a lot of business people out of business.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America.",1,1,0,1,1,1

"And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I will address you as Mr. President.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You didn't do that with Mr. with President Bush in 1992.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago.",1,0,0,0,0,1

"Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children.",1,0,1,0,1,1

"That's what Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole did, not me.",1,0,1,0,0,0
So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I think it's very difficult.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's be honest about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0

You talk about the Brady Bill.,0,0,1,0,0,0
There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street.",1,1,1,0,1,1

But let's look at the facts here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.,1,0,1,0,0,0
He tried to keep it from coming to my desk.,1,0,0,0,0,0
He didn't succeed and I signed it and I'm glad I did.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Then when we had the assault weapons ban in the Senate, Senator Dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the National Rifle Association didn't want the assault weapons ban, just like they didn't want the Brady Bill.",1,0,1,0,1,1
But two years later nobody's lost their handguns.,1,0,0,0,0,1

You ask when do you decide to deploy them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The interests of the American people must be at stake.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our values must be at stake.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to be able to make a difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And the United States needs help from other countries.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.,0,0,1,0,1,0

That's the point I made.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to be firm and strong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I hope that will happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It will happen starting next January and maybe it can happen the balance of this year.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We have not been firm and strong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It's a haven for drug smugglers and we don't have a firm policy when it comes to Fidel Castro.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"In my view, the policy has failed.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So Congress passes the law, the President signs it, like he does a lot of things.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"A lot of these election-year conversions, the President talks about the drug money, and all the other things, all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system.,1,0,0,0,1,0
"When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year.",1,0,0,0,1,1
This is a serious business.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's about your family; it's about your business, and in this case it's about a firmer policy with Cuba.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases.",1,0,1,0,1,1
His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn't hike.,1,0,1,0,1,1
So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill.",0,0,0,0,1,0
The President was opposed to it in 1993.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Most people want to see their own doctor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"We've been for that for four, five, six years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The President held it up.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision.",1,0,1,0,1,1
But it will cover preexisting conditions.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"If you change your job, you're going to be covered.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn't want to do that.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I'm proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh '93, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.,1,0,0,0,0,1
I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"You can also deduct long-term care now, so it's a good it's a good start.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Unfortunately, a lot of people, have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and we've been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"What happened was one of the Turkish, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north, but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We did not feel that I could commit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Was it the right thing to do?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did it make him withdraw from the north?,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Well, he does , he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have learned that you give him an inch he'll take a mile.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Did we inflict any damage?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn't even understand that.",0,1,1,0,1,1
We had to get their permission.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The bottom line is, we went in there alone.",1,0,0,0,0,0
We are supposed to be operating under a U.N. resolution.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We did it without any of our allies that helped in the Gulf.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Senator Dole has two or three times before tonight criticized me for working with the U.N. Now I'm being criticized for not working with the U.N.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Sometimes the United States has to act alone or at least has to act first.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I could not send soldiers into the north of Iraq, that would have been wrong.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I still believe it was the right thing to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, there were some good pictures, but does it fall into that category?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to be very serious.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia.,1,0,0,0,0,0
I supported him on NAFTA and GATT.,1,0,0,0,0,0
So it's not that we always disagree.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some notion what the end result might be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Now maybe it's better just to get together and sit down and talk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe that was the purpose.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I know talks have started again today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But again it's almost like an ad hoc foreign policy.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Now, one thing I don't understand, Jim, is why is it that the wealthiest 1% get their tax cuts the first year, but 95% of seniors have to wait four to five years before they get a single penny?",1,0,0,0,1,1
I guess my answer to that is the man is running on Medi-scare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Trying to frighten people in the voting booth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's just not the way I think and it's not my intentions and not my plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want all seniors to have prescription drugs in Medicare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to reform Medicare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been opportunity to do so but this administration has failed to do it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned.",0,0,0,0,0,0
If you're happy with the system you can stay in it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But there are a lot of procedures that haven't kept up in Medicare with the current times.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"No prescription drug benefits, no drug therapy, no preventative medicines, no vision care.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need to have a modern system to help seniors, and the idea of supporting a federally controlled 132,000-page document bureaucracy as being a compassionate way for seniors, and the only compassionate source of care for seniors is not my vision.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I believe we ought to give seniors more options.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe we ought to make the system work better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, let's come together.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You've had your chance, Vice President, you've been there for eight years and nothing has been done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"My point is, is that my plan not only trusts seniors with options, my plan sets aside $3.4 trillion for Medicare over the next ten years.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"My plan also says it requires a new approach in Washington, D.C.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going to require somebody who can work across the partisan divide.,0,0,0,0,0,0
If I could respond to that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Under my plan I will put Medicare in an iron clad lockbox and prevent the money from being used for anything other than Medicare.,0,0,0,0,1,1
The governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the Republican as well as Democratic leaders in Congress have endorsed it.,1,0,1,0,1,1
I would be interested to see if he would say this evening he'll put Medicare in a lockbox.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think he will because under his plan if you work out the numbers Ã‚ $100 billion comes out of Medicare just for the wealthiest 1% in the tax cut.,1,1,1,0,1,1
Now here is the difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Some people who say the word reform actually mean cuts.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Under the governor's plan, if you kept the same fee for service that you have now under Medicare, your premiums would go up by between 18% and 47%, and that is the study of the Congressional plan that he's modeled his proposal on by the Medicare actuaries.",1,1,0,0,1,1
Let me give you one quick example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There is a man here tonight named George McKinney from Milwaukee.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"He's 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They have an income of $25,000 a year.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They can't pay for their prescription drugs and so they're some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"Under my plan, half of their costs would be paid right away.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Under Governor Bush's plan, they would get not one penny for four to five years and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or to an insurance company and ask them for coverage, but there would be no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the terms and conditions.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"I cannot let this go by, the old-style Washington politics, of we're going to scare you in the voting booth.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Under my plan the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's called Immediate Helping Hand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Instead of squabbling and finger pointing, he gets immediate help.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Can I make another point?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They get $25,000 a year income, that makes them ineligible.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Look, this is a man who has great numbers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm beginning to think not only did he invent the Internet, but he invented the calculator.",0,0,1,0,0,1
It's a scaring -- he's trying to scare people in the voting booth.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Under my tax plan that he continues to criticize, I set one-third.",1,0,1,0,0,0
The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.,0,0,1,0,0,1
But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.,1,1,0,0,0,1
"If you're a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50,000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay.",1,0,0,0,0,1
It's from $4000 to about $2000.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, the difference in our plans is I want that $2,000 to go to you, and the vice president would like to be spending the $2,000 on your behalf.",1,0,0,0,0,1
It's just clear you can go to the website and look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you make more than $25,000 a year you don't get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then you're pushed into a Medicare -- into an HMO or insurance company plan, and there's no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions.",1,0,0,0,1,1
And the insurance companies say it won't work and they won't offer these plans.,1,0,0,0,1,1
The difference is I want to bring it to 100% and he wants to bring it to 5%.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's totally false for him to stand up here and say that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They have had their chance to get something done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All seniors will be covered, all poor seniors will have their prescription drugs paid for, and in the meantime, we'll have a plan to help poor seniors and in the meantime it could be one year or two years.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Let me call your attention to the key word there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He said all poor seniors.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All seniors are covered under prescription drugs in my plan.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"If we can get it done in the first year, you bet.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yours is phased in in eight years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
For the first four years -- it takes a year to pass it and for the first four years only the poor are covered.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Middle class seniors like George McKinney and his wife are not covered for four to five years.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And here is the simple difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And it focuses not only on increasing the supply, which I think we have to do, but also on working on the consumption side.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And domestic sources that are cleaner and better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I'm proposing a plan that will give tax credits and tax incentives for the rapid development of new kinds of cars and trucks and buses and factories and boilers and furnaces that don't have as much pollution, that don't burn as much energy, and that help us get out on the cutting edge of the new technologies that will create millions of new jobs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Because, when we sell these new products here, we'll then be able to sell them overseas.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There is a ravenous demand for them overseas.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, another big difference is Governor Bush is proposing to open up some of our most precious environmental treasures, like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for the big oil companies to go in and start producing oil there.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I think that is the wrong choice.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It would only give us a few months' worth of oil and the oil wouldn't start flowing for many years into the future.,0,0,1,0,0,1
I don't think it's a fair price to pay to destroy precious parts of America's environment.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's an issue I know a lot about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was a small oil person for a while in west Texas.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is an administration that's had no plan.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And all of a sudden the results of having no plan have caught up with America.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"First and foremost we have to fully fund LIHEAP which is a way to help low income folks, particularly here in the east to pay for high fuel bills.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The only way to become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore at home.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska.,0,0,0,0,0,0
When that field is online it will produce one million barrels a day.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Today we import one million barrels from Saddam Hussein.,1,1,0,0,1,1
"I would rather that a million come from our own hemisphere, our own country as opposed to Saddam Hussein.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I want to build more pipelines to move natural gas throughout this hemisphere.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to develop the coal resources in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got abundant supplies of energy here in America and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d better get after it, we better start exploring it or otherwise we'll be in deep trouble in the future because of our dependency upon foreign sources of crude.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I'm for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me say, that I found one thing in Governor Bush's answer that we certainly agree on, and that's the low income heating assistance program.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I commend you for supporting that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And to establish a permanent home heating oil reserve here in the northeast.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, as for the proposals that I've worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The fact is for the last few years in the Congress, we've faced a lot of opposition to them.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They've only approved about 10% of the agenda I've helped to send up there.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"I think we need to get serious about this energy crisis, both in the Congress and in the White House, and if you entrust me with the presidency, I will tackle this problem and focus on new technologies that will make us less dependent on big oil or foreign oil.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secondly the difference is we need to explore at home.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the vice president doesn't believe in exploration in Alaska.,1,0,1,0,0,1
There's a lot of shut-in gas that we need to be moving out of Alaska by pipeline.,1,0,0,0,0,1
There's an interesting issue up in the northwest as well.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm against removing dams in the northwest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know where the vice president stands but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a renewable energy source of energy.,0,1,0,0,0,1
We need to keep that in line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There is an abundant supply of coal in America.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I know we can do a better job of clean coal technologies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to ask the Congress for $2 billion to make sure we have the cleanest coal technologies in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,1
My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We also need to have a hemispheric energy policy where Canada, Mexico and the United States come together.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he's a man I know from Mexico.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I talked to him about how best to expedite the exploration of natural gas in Mexico and transport it up to the United States so we become less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil.,1,0,0,0,0,1
This is a major problem facing America.,0,0,1,0,0,0
The administration did not deal with it.,1,0,1,0,1,0
It's time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If I may just briefly, Jim, note.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I found a couple of other things we agree upon.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I strongly support new investments in clean coal technology.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I made a proposal three months ago on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We don't have to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I know the oil companies have been itching to do that, but it is not the right thing for the future.",0,0,1,0,0,1
It's the right thing for the consumers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well can I have the last word on this?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think a president can do that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I'm worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions.",0,1,1,0,0,1
"This is a very important topic and it's a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue.",1,0,1,0,0,0
I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I know we need to ban partial birth abortions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America.,0,0,0,0,0,1
This is an issue that will require a new attitude.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've been battling over abortion for a long period of time.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to -- to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor's life with a gun will understand that that's not the way America is meant to be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision.",1,0,0,0,0,1
They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug.,1,0,0,0,1,1
This is indeed a very important issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman's life or to act if her health is severely at risk.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That's not the main issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I support a woman's right to choose.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman's right to choose.",1,0,1,0,1,1
He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies.",1,0,0,0,0,0
And I think a woman's right to choose ought to be protected and defended.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think a president can unilaterally overturn it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
The FDA has made its decision.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"I think once a decision has been made, it's been made unless it's proven to be unsafe to women.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Jim, the question you asked, if I heard you correctly, was would he support legislation to overturn it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And if I heard the statement day before yesterday, you said you would order -- he said he would order his FDA appointee to review the decision.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Now that sounds to me a little bit different.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just think that we ought to support the decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I said I would make sure that women would be safe who used the drug.,1,0,0,0,0,0
The voters should assume I have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Voters will know I'll put competent judges on the bench.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to write social policy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That they're appointed for life and that they ought to look at the Constitution as sacred.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They shouldn't misuse their bench.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't believe in liberal activist judges.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I believe in strict constructionists.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Those are the kind of judges I will appoint.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've named four supreme court justices in the State of Texas and would ask the people to check out their qualifications, their deliberations.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They're good, solid men and women who have made good, sound judgments on behalf of the people of Texas.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We both use similar language to reach an exactly opposite outcome.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I don't favor a litmus test, but I know that there are ways to assess how a potential justice interprets the Constitution.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And in my view, the Constitution ought to be interpreted as a document that grows with our country and our history.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I believe, for example, that there is a right of privacy in the Fourth Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And when the phrase a strict constructionist is used and when the names of Scalia and Thomas are used as the benchmarks for who would be appointed, those are code words, and nobody should mistake this, for saying the governor would appoint people who would overturn Roe v. Wade.",1,0,1,0,1,1
It's very clear to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would appoint people that have a philosophy that I think would have it quite likely they would uphold Roe v. Wade.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It sounds like the vice presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not right very many times tonight.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I just told you the criteria on which I'll appoint judges.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a record of appointing judges in the State of Texas.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's what a governor gets to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A governor gets to name supreme court judges.,0,0,0,0,0,1
He also reads all kinds of things into my tax plan and into my Medicare plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want the viewers out there to listen to what I have to say about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It would be likely that they would uphold Roe v. Wade.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I do believe it's wrong to use a litmus test.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"If you look at the history of a lower court judge's rulings, you can get a pretty good idea of how they'll interpret questions.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"A lot of questions are first impression, and these questions that have been seen many times come up in a new context and so -- but, you know, this is a very important issue.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Because a lot of young women in this country take this right for granted and it could be lost.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"It is on the ballot in this election, make no mistake about it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I'll tell you what kind of judges he'll put on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He'll put liberal activists justices who will use their bench to subvert the legislature, that's what he'll do.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, Milosevic has lost the election.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"His opponent, Kostunica, has won the election.",1,0,0,0,1,0
Milosevic's government refuses to release the vote count.,1,0,1,0,1,1

"I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The people of Serbia have acted very bravely in kicking this guy out of office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so-called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, we've made it clear, along with our allies, that when Milosevic leaves, then Serbia will be able to have a more normal relationship with the rest of the world.",1,0,0,0,0,1
That is a very strong incentive that we've given them to do the right thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Bear in mind also, Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal and he should be held accountable for his actions.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, we have to take measured steps because the sentiment within Serbia is, for understandable reasons, against the United States because their nationalism -- even if they don't like Milosevic, they still have some feelings lingering from the NATO action there.",0,0,1,0,0,1
So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I hope that he'll be out of office very shortly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm pleased with the results of the election.",0,0,0,0,0,0
As the vice president is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's time for the man to go.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why it's important to make sure our alliances are as strong as they possibly can be to keep the pressure on Mr. Milosevic.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But this will be an interesting moment for the Russians to step up and lead as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Be a wonderful time for the Russians to step into the Balkans and convince Mr. Milosevic that it's in his best interest and his country's best interest to leave office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Russians have a lot of sway in that part of the world.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We would like to see the Russians use that sway to encourage democracy to take hold.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's time for the man to leave.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In this particular situation, no.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Bear in mind that we have a lot of sanctions in force against Serbia right now.,1,0,0,0,1,1
And the people of Serbia know that they can escape all those sanctions if this guy is turned out of power.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea.",0,0,1,0,0,0

They currently favor going forward with a runoff election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that's the wrong thing.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think the governor's instinct is not necessarily bad because we have worked with the Russians in a constructive way in Kosovo, for example, to end the conflict there.",0,0,0,0,0,0

He's called them phony and fuzzy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The fact remains almost 30% of his proposed tax cut goes to -- only to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.,1,1,1,0,0,1
More money goes to the -- can I have a rebuttal here?,0,1,0,0,0,0
Let me tell you what the facts are.,0,0,0,0,0,0

$665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%.,1,0,0,0,0,1

"And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour; then it's leveled again, but in the meantime you've wrecked the country with these kind of deals.",1,0,1,0,1,1
We got to cut it out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Carole, the thing that saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports, and what I'm trying to do is increase our exports.",1,0,0,0,0,1

"That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But any one that's here, we want to have more jobs here.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it's also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan.",1,0,1,0,1,1
So what is the answer?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just mention three things very quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them, and, if they're not, have measures on the books that don't take forever and a day to implement.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Number two, change the tax code.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are more deductions in the tax code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plant and equipment here.,1,0,1,0,1,1
Our competitors don't do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Number three, stop the federal government's program that now gives low-interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries, but we won't do the same thing for plants that stay here.",0,0,1,0,0,1
So more trade but on fair terms -- and favor investment in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll tell you exactly why.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.,1,0,1,0,0,1
I'll tell you exactly what I think can be done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you'd have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them and it would even make the economy worse.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go.",1,0,0,0,0,1
If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Let me also say, we're having an election today.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You'll have a shot at me in 4 years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job and I would welcome you to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm a little confused here, because I don't see how you can grow the deficit down by raising people's taxes.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"You see, I don't think the American people are taxed too little.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I think they're taxed too much.,0,0,1,0,1,1
I went for one tax increase and when I make a mistake I admit it.,1,0,0,0,0,1
I said that wasn't the right thing to do.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220.",1,0,1,0,1,1
I don't believe that's the way to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Here's some thing that'll help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Give us a balanced budget amendment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment.",1,0,0,0,0,1
I'd like the government to have that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Some sophisticates think it may be a little gimmicky.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You can check 10% of that if you want to, in the 1 box, and that 10%, $100, or if you're paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1000, check it off and make the government, make it lower the deficit by that amount.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And if the Congress won't do it, if they can't get together and negotiate how to do that, then you'd have a sequester across the board.",0,0,1,0,0,0
You'd exempt Social Security -- I don't want to tax or touch Social Security.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I'm the president that said hey, don't mess with Social Security, and we haven't.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the main growing thing in the budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The program that the president -- two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, we're $4 trillion in debt.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, the thing I love about it -- I'm just a businessman.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This situation got so bad that I decided I'd better get into it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The American people asked me to get into it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And what I'm looking for is who did it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, they're the 2 folks involved so maybe if you put them together, they did it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, the facts are we have to fix it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy I had multiple job offers.",0,0,0,0,1,1
Young people with high grades can't get a job.,1,1,1,0,0,1
People -- the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making -- 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Now that's up to 40%.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And what's happened in the meantime?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The dollar's gone through the floor.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Now, whose fault is that?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Somewhere out there there's an extraterrestrial that's doing this to us, I guess.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And everybody says they take responsibility.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Somebody somewhere has to take responsibility for this.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Put it to you bluntly, American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0

When I was a boy it took 2 generations to double the standard of living.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Today it will take 12 generations.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Our children will not see the American dream because of this debt that somebody somewhere dropped on us.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"No, I don't have an answer for everything.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Like Jerry Brown, the 800 number.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"-- I couldn't agree with you more, couldn't agree with you more.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you have to look at it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In terms of programs, I've submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail.",1,0,0,0,0,1
It's so heavy they'd give you a broken back.,0,0,0,0,0,0

But character is an important part of the equation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The other night Governor Clinton raised my -- I don't know if you saw the debate the other night.,0,0,1,0,0,1
You did -- suffered through that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, he raised the question of my father -- it was a good line, well rehearsed and well delivered.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Probably a lot of kids here disagree with me.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But that's what I feel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what I feel passionately about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm thinking of Ross Perot's running mate sitting in the jail.,0,0,1,0,0,0
How would he feel about it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the big argument I have with the governor on this is this taking different positions on different issues -- trying to be one thing to one person here that's opposing the NAFTA agreement and then for it -- what we call waffling.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And I do think that you can't turn the White House into the Waffle House.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You've got to say what you're for and you've got to --,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to --,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to --,0,0,0,0,0,0
I get wound up because I feel strongly --,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I started doing these formats a year ago in New Hampshire and I found that we had huge crowds because all I did was let people ask questions and I tried to give very specific answers.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I also had a program starting last year.,1,0,0,0,0,0
I've been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don't have to just go blue in the face anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Mr. Bush said once again I was going to have $150 billion tax increase.,1,0,1,0,1,1

We'll have a debate in 4 days and we can talk about this character thing again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the Washington Post ran a long editorial today saying they couldn't believe Mr. Bush was making character an issue and they said he was the greatest quote ""political chameleon"" for changing his positions of all times.",0,0,1,0,1,1

Please don't get into the Washington Post.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Let's don't -- you don't have to believe it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not interested in his character.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I want to change the character of the presidency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Mr. Perot to do for the next 4 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.,0,0,0,0,0,0

So I don't want the implication to be that somehow everything we say is just cooked up and put in our head by somebody else.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I worked 12 years very hard as a governor on the real problems of real people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm just as sick as you are by having to wake up and figure out how to defend myself every day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I never thought I'd ever be involved in anything like this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I don't have any foreign money in my campaign.,1,1,0,0,0,0
I don't have any foreign lobbyists on leave in my campaign.,1,0,1,0,0,0
I don't have any PAC money in my campaign.,1,1,0,0,0,0
"I've got 5.5 million hard-working people who put me on the ballot, and I belong to them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
And they're interested in what you're interested in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've already taken the pledge on cutting the deficit in half.,1,0,0,0,1,1
I never got to say that.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"There's a great young group, Lead or Leave, college students, young people, who don't want us to spend their money.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I took the pledge we'd cut it out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll be glad to take a shot at it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm not sure that -- and I can understand if you haven't seen this, because there's been a lot of hue and cry.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We passed this year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways -- $150 billion for improving the infrastructure.,1,0,0,0,1,1
That happened when I was president.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down.",0,0,1,0,0,1
But I would cite that as a major accomplishment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We hear all the negatives.,0,0,0,0,0,0
When you're president you expect this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Everybody's running against the incumbent.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But here's something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you're talking about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our home initiative -- our home ownership initiative -- HOPE -- that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Our enterprise zones, that we hear a lot of lip service about in Congress, would bring jobs into the inner city.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
When we went out to south central in Los Angeles -- some of you may remember the riots there.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I went to a boys' club.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And everyone of them -- the boys' club leaders, the ministers -- all of them were saying pass enterprise zones.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But there's going to be a new Congress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's going to be a new Congress because the old one -- I don't want to get this man made at me -- but there was a post office scandal and a bank scandal.,1,0,1,0,0,0
You're going to have a lot of new members of Congress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Help me pass these programs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sure, but the problem is, you get so many things included in a great big bill that you have to look at the overall good.",0,0,1,0,0,1
That's the problem with our system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You could knock out the tax increases and you could do what the people want, and that's create enterprise zones.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That bill pays for these urban enterprise zones by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And that's why he wants to veto it, just like he vetoed an earlier bill this year.",1,0,1,0,1,1
This is not mud slinging.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This is fact slinging -- a bill earlier this year.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"This is facts -- that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities, in our country.",0,0,1,0,0,1
But it asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"I mean, we agree with that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me tell you specifically what my plan does.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental clean-ups and new technologies for the 21st century.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And we would target it especially in areas that have been either depressed or which have lost a lot of defense related jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"They ought to be engaged in breaking ground in other technologies, doing waste recycling, clean water technology and things of that kind.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We can create millions of jobs in these new technologies- -more than we're going to lose in defense -- if we target it.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"But we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"It's making the country poorer, which is why I answered the gentleman the way I did before.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to both bring down the deficit and get our economy going through these kinds of investments in order to get the kind of wealth and jobs and incomes we need in America.,0,0,0,0,0,1
First you've got to have money to pay for these things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So you've got to create jobs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are all kinds of ways to create jobs in the inner city.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I talk to the Republican leaders and they want it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But since they're bred from childhood to fight with one another rather than get results, you know, I would be glad to drop out and spend a little time and see if we couldn't build some bridges.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, results is what counts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The president can't order Congress around.,0,0,1,0,1,0
Congress can't order the president around.,1,0,1,0,1,0
"That's not bad for a guy that's never been there, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you have to work together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The president wants it, but we can't get it because we sit here in gridlock because it's a campaign year.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We didn't fund a lot of other things this year, like the savings and loan mess.",1,0,0,0,0,0
That's another story that we're going to pay a big price for right after the election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The facts are though -- the facts are -- the American people are hurting.,0,0,1,0,0,0
These people are hurting in the inner cities.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"We're shipping the quote, ""low paying jobs"" overseas.",0,0,1,0,1,1
What are low paying jobs?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday's industries.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They're tomorrow's industries in the inner cities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me say in my case, if I'm out of work, I'll cut grass tomorrow to take care of my family; I'll be happy to make shoes, I'll be happy to make clothing, I'll make sausage.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You just give me a job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Put those jobs in the inner cities instead of doing diplomatic deals and shipping them to China where prison labor does the work.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"If you ask me if I could fly a fighter plane or be an astronaut, I can't.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I've spent my life creating jobs.,1,0,0,0,0,0
That's something I know how to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, very simply, in the inner city, they're starved -- you see, small business is the way to jump start the inner city, not --",0,0,1,0,0,1
You want jobs in the inner city?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you want jobs in the inner city?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I've listened to both sides, and if they would talk to one another instead of throwing rocks, I think we could get a lot done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, the president who is anxious, I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I think the press would follow that so closely that probably they would get it done.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That's the way I would do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I doubt if they'll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I support the right to keep and bear arms.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The third thing I would say -- it doesn't bear directly on gun control, but it's very important -- we need more police on the street.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"There is a crime bill which would put more police on the street, which was killed for this session by a filibuster in the Senate, mostly be Republican senators, and I think it's a shame it didn't pass, I think it should be made the law -- but it had the Brady bill in it, the waiting period.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you've seen crime go down.",1,0,0,0,1,1
In Houston there's been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force.,1,0,0,0,0,1
So I know it can work; I've seen it happen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you put your finger on a major problem.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I talk about strengthening the American family and it's very hard to strengthen the family if people are scared to walk down to the corner store and, you know, send their kid down to get a loaf of bread.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have been fighting for very strong anti-crime legislation -- habeas corpus reform, so you don't have these endless appeals, so when somebody gets sentenced, hey, this is for real.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't go away.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I'll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Virginia's in the lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I am not for national registration of firearms.,1,1,1,0,0,1
Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"I am for the right, as the governor says- -I'm a sportsman and I don't think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I was not for the bill that he was talking about because it was not tough enough on the criminal.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"I'm very pleased that the Fraternal Order of Police in Little Rock, Arkansas endorsed me because I think they see I'm trying to strengthen the anti-crime legislation.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We've got more money going out for local police than any previous administration.,1,0,0,0,0,1
So we've got to get it under control and there's one last point I'd make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're making some progress, doing a little better on interdiction.",1,0,0,0,0,0
We're not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug-users.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The good news is, and I think it's true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"So we're making progress but until we get that one done, we're not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn't get to make a comment on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Oh, you're going to let me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On any program, and this includes crime, you'll find we have all kinds of great plans lying around that never get enacted into law and implemented.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"I don't care what it is -- competitiveness, health care, crime, you name it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Brady Bill, I agree that it's a timid step in the right direction but it won't fix it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So why pass a law that won't fix it?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, what it really boils down to is can you live -- we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we've forgotten the rights of the innocent.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And in our country we have evolved to a point where we've put millions of innocent people in jail because you go to the poor neighborhoods and they've put bars on their windows and bars on their doors and put themselves in jail to protect the things that they acquired legitimately.,0,0,1,0,1,1
We have got to become more concerned about people who play by the rules and get the balance we require.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is going to take first, building a consensus at grassroots America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But don't just sit here slow dancing for 4 years doing nothing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll be glad to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I strongly support term limits for members of the US Congress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe it would return the government closer to the people, the way that Ross Perot is talking about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The president's terms are limited to 2, a total of 8 years.",0,0,0,0,0,1
What's wrong with limiting the terms of members of Congress to 12?,0,0,0,0,0,1
Congress has gotten kind of institutionalized.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together.",1,0,1,0,1,1
We've got to do something about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think you get a certain arrogance, bureaucratic arrogance, if people stay there too long.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And how to get them passed?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Send us some people that will pass the idea.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think you will.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the American people want it now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Every place I go I talk about it, and I think they want it done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Actually, you'd have to have some amendments to the Constitution because of the way the Constitution reads.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I know they're popular, but I'm against them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe, number one, it would pose a real problem for a lot of smaller states in the Congress who have enough trouble now making sure their interests are heard.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Number 2, I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I want to cut the size of the congressional staffs, but I think you're going to have too much influence there with people who were never elected, who have lots of expertise.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Number 3, if the people really have a mind to change, they can.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You're going to have 120 to 150 new members of Congress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, let me tell you what I favor instead.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If you did that you could take away the incumbents' advantage because challengers like me would have a chance to run against incumbents like him for House races and Senate races, and then the voters could make up their own mind without being subject to an unfair fight.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"So that's how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me do first on a personal level.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the American people send me up to do this job, I intend to be there one term.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do not intend to spend one minute of one day thinking about re-election.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"If you want to hear it, you get it tomorrow night -- you'll hear it tomorrow night.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But we have got to reform government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought.",0,0,1,0,0,0
So we need to do the reforms and the term limits.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And after we reform it, it won't be a lifetime career opportunity; good people will go serve and then go back to their homes and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month and then take time off to run some president's campaign.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I don't think there are any villains, but, boy, is the system rotten.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I've had more people talk to me about their health care problems I guess than anything else, all across America -- you know, people who've lost their jobs, lost their businesses, had to give up their jobs because of sick children.",1,0,0,0,0,1
So let me try to answer you in this way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's start with a premise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people.",1,1,0,0,1,1
We have 35 million people without any insurance at all -- and I see them all the time.,1,0,0,0,0,1
A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"So if you analyze where we're out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn't be spent in any other nation.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I think you have to tell the pharmaceutical companies they can't keep raising drug prices at three times the rate of inflation.,0,0,1,0,1,1
I think you have to take on medical fraud.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines and that if they follow those guidelines that raises the presumption that they didn't do anything wrong.,1,0,0,0,0,0
I think you have to have a system of primary and preventive clinics in our inner cities and our rural areas so people can have access to health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The key is to control the cost and maintain the quality.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I think there has to be -- I think Mr. Perot and I agree on this, there has to be a national commission of health care providers and health care consumers that set ceilings to keep health costs in line with inflation, plus population growth.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, let me say, some people say we can't do this but Hawaii does it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York.",1,1,0,0,1,1
They now have a plan to cover everybody and their premiums are two-thirds of the rest of the country.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"It's a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I'm going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I just have to say something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to stampede.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Ross was very articulate across the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want anybody to stampede to cut the president's salary off altogether.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Barbara's sitting over here and I -- but what I have proposed, 10% cut, downsize the government, and we can get that done.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"She asked a question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame.",0,0,0,0,0,0
One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Doctors don't dare to deliver babies sometimes because they're afraid that somebody's going to sue them.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"People don't dare -- medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they're afraid that some lawyer's going to come along and get a big lawsuit.",0,0,1,0,0,0
So you can't blame the practitioners for the health problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And my program is this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"A great big company can buy -- Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful.",0,0,0,0,0,1
He can buy insurance cheaper than Mom and Pop's store on the corner.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"But if those Mom and Pop stores all get together and pool, they too can bring the cost of insurance down.",1,0,0,0,0,0
So I want to keep the quality of health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That means keep government out of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to do -- I don't like this idea of these boards.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It all sounds to me like you're going to have some government setting price.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I want competition and I want to pool the insurance and take care of it that way and have -- oh, here's the other point.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think medical care should go with the person.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you leave a business, I think your insurance should go with you to some other business.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You shouldn't be worrying if you get a new job as to whether that's gonna -- and part of our plan is to make it what they call portable -- big word, but that means if you're working for the Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I think it's a good program.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm really excited about getting it done, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have the most expensive health care system in the world.,1,0,0,0,1,1
Twelve percent of our gross national product goes to health care.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Our industrial competitors, who are beating us in competition, spend less and have better health care.",1,0,0,0,0,0

They concluded that my plan would cover everybody and his would leave 27 million behind by the year 2000 and that my plan in the next 12 years would save $2.2 trillion in public and private money to reinvest in this economy and the average family would save $1200 a year under the plan that I offered without any erosion in the quality of health care,1,0,0,0,1,1

What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.,0,0,1,0,0,1
It is because America has not invested in its people.,0,0,1,0,0,1
It is because we have not grown.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It is because we've had 12 years of trickle down economics.,1,0,0,0,0,0

We've had 4 years where we've produced no private sector jobs.,1,0,1,0,1,1

I can't give you a specific answer on Pension Guarantee Fund.,0,0,0,0,0,1

You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Why did our government do it?,0,0,1,0,0,0
To get the interest rates down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A 1% increase in interest rates in that $2.8 trillion is $28 billion a year.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, when you look at what Germany pays for money and what we don't pay for money, you realize there's quite a spread, right, and you realize this is a temporary thing and there's going to be another sucking sound that runs our deficit through the roof.",0,0,1,0,0,1

You've got to do that; we got to get those costs down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program -- a lot of you may not know this -- it produces a $70 billion surplus a year.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Social Security is in surplus $70 billion.,1,0,1,1,1,1
"Six increases in the payroll tax -- that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief.",1,0,1,0,0,1
What do we have to do?,0,0,0,0,0,0

"We had a guarantee on the S&Ls, right?",0,0,0,0,0,0
We had a guarantee -- and what happened?,0,0,1,0,0,0
You picked up a $500-billion bill because of the dumb way the federal government deregulated it.,1,0,1,0,0,1
So I think we are going to have to change and strengthen the pension requirements on private retirement plans.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"With all this instability and breaking into republics, and all the Middle Eastern countries going over there and shopping for weapons, we've got our work cut out for us.",1,0,1,0,0,0

We have to have money to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to have our people at work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"See, for 45 years we were preoccupied with the Red Army.",1,0,0,0,0,1

We may differ about what the elements of that are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that defense needs to be -- with fewer people in permanent armed services but with greater mobility on the land, in the air and on the sea, with a real dedication to continuing development of high technology weaponry and well trained people.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Number 2, if you don't rebuild the economic strength of this country at home, we won't be a superpower.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And I believe you're right on to something, that if we don't change the education we're not going to be able to compete.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Federal funding for education is up substantially -- Pell grants are up.,1,1,0,0,0,1
But it isn't going to get the job done if we don't change K through 12.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, let me say that I've spent more of my time and life on this in the last 12 years than any other issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Seventy percent of my state's money goes to the public schools, and I was really honored when Time magazine said that our schools have shown more improvement than any other state in the country except one other -- they named 2 states showing real strides forward in the 80s.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"So I care a lot about this, and I've spent countless hours in schools.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But let me start with what you said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it's nowhere near enough.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We live in a world where what you earn depends on what you can learn, where the average 18- year-old will change jobs 8 times in a lifetime and where none of us can promise any of you that what you now do for a living is absolutely safe from now on.",1,1,0,0,0,1
"Nobody running can promise that, there's too much change in the world.",0,0,1,0,0,0
So what should we do?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don't go to college.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And community colleges are on the job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number three, we'd open the doors to college education to high school graduates without regard to income.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, 5, I would have an aggressive program of school reform, more choices -- I favor public schools or these new charter schools -- we can talk about that if you want.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think we should spend tax money on private schools.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Those things would revolutionize American education and take us to the top economically.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 6 years -- I budget all this in my budget, and in 6 years the college program would cost 8 billion dollars over and above what -- the present student loan program costs 4; you pay 3 billion dollars for busted loans, because we don't have an automatic recovery system, and a billion dollars in bank fees.",1,1,1,0,1,1
So the net cost would be 8 billion 6 years from now in a trillion-plus budget -- not very much.,1,0,1,0,1,1
The other stuff -- all the other stuff I mentioned -- costs much less than that.,1,0,0,0,0,1
The Head Start program full funding would cost about 5 billion more.,1,1,0,0,1,1
"And it's all covered in my budget from -- the plans that I've laid out -- from raising taxes on families with incomes above $200,000 and asking foreign corporations to pay the same tax that American corporations do on the same income, from $140 billion in budget cuts, including what I think are very prudent cuts in the defense budget.",1,0,1,0,0,1
It's all covered in the plan.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I've got scars to show for being around education reform.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You're going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time you're spending $199 billion dollars a year, somebody's getting it.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And the children get lost in the process.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world -- 199 billion a year -- and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement.",1,1,0,0,1,1
One more time you've bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance.,0,0,0,0,0,1
This is a government that is not serving you.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"By and large it should be local -- the more local, the better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"The best people in a small town will serve on the school board; you get into big cities, it's political patronage, stepping stones -- you get the job, give your relatives a janitor's job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make, and with luck they clean the cafeteria once a week.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, you're paying for that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Those schools belong to you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we put up with that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, as long as we put up with that, that's what you're going to get.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And these folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks and the children get lost.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home -- nothing will ever replace that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day.",0,0,1,0,0,0
There's nothing -- the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You need small schools, not big schools.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In a little school everybody is somebody; individualism is very important.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Everybody told me they were cost-effective.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I did a study on it; they're cost- ineffective.,0,0,1,0,0,1
5000 students -- why is a high school that big?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, that has nothing to do with learning.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Secondly, across Texas, typically half of the school day was non-academic pursuits -- in one place it was 35%.",1,0,0,0,1,1
In Texas you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Found a boy -- excuse me, but this gives the flavor -- a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston and missed 65 days going to livestock shows.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers.",0,0,0,0,1,0
That's the only way we got him back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"(Laughter) Now, that's your tax money being wasted.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"At the end of the first day, that little child wants out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You've got to have world class teachers, world class books.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn't want to go back the second day.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't have time to tell you the stories.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Finally, if we don't fix this, you're right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We can't have the industries of tomorrow unless we have the best educated workforce.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And here you've got, for the disadvantaged children, you've got to have early childhood development.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Cheapest money you'll ever spend.,0,0,0,0,0,0
First contact should be with the money when she's pregnant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That little child needs to be loved and hugged and nurtured and made to feel special, like your children were.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They learn to think well or poorly of themselves in the first 18 months.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And in the first few years they either learn how to learn or don't learn how to learn.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if they don't, they wind up in prison.",0,0,0,0,1,0
And it costs more to keep them in prison than it does to send them to Harvard.,1,0,1,0,1,1
I just had a word of clarification because of something Governor Clinton said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My school choice program, GI Bill for Kids, does not take public money and give it to private schools.",0,0,1,0,0,1
It does what the GI Bill itself did when I came out of World War II.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It takes public money and gives it to families or individuals to choose the school they want.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And where it's been done, those schools, like in Rochester, those schools that weren't chosen find that they then compete and do better.",1,0,0,0,0,0
So I think it's worth a shot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got a pilot program.,1,0,0,0,0,0
It ought to be tried.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"School choice -- public, private or religious.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not to the schools but to -- you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think -- make all schools better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I just want to mention if I could --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Including the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if they're poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have a big program in my state that teaches mothers or fathers to teach their kids to get ready for school.,1,0,0,0,0,0
It's the most successful thing we've ever done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just a fact clarification real quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country.,1,0,0,0,1,1
There are 9 countries that spend more than we do on public education.,1,0,0,0,0,1
We spend more on education 'cause we spend so much more on colleges.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"But if you look at public education alone and you take into account the fact that we have more racial diversity and more poverty, it makes a big difference.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"There are great public schools where there's public school choice, accountability and brilliant principals.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll just mention one -- the Beasley Academic Center in Chicago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I commend it to anybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's as good as any private school in the country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I don't have any idea but I hope it will happen some time in my lifetime.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that this country is electing more and more African Americans and Latinos and Asian Americans who are representing districts that are themselves not necessarily of a majority of their race.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"The American people are beginning to vote across racial lines, and I hope it will happen more and more.",0,0,0,0,0,1
More and more women are being elected.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Look at all these women Senate candidates we have here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you know, according to my mother and my wife and my daughter, this world would be a lot better place if women were running it most of the time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do think there are special experiences and judgments and backgrounds and understandings that women bring to this process, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This lady said here, how have you been affected by the economy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, women know what's it like to be paid an unequal amount for equal work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They know what it's like not to have flexible working hours.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They know what it's like not to have family leave or childcare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it will happen in my lifetime.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she'd be elected.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"(Laughter) You don't want us to mention appointees, but when you see the quality of people in our administration, see how Colin Powell performed -- I say administration --",0,0,0,0,0,1
You weren't impressed with the fact that he --,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Yeah, but wouldn't that suggest to the American people, then, here's a quality person, if he decided that he could automatically get the nomination of either party?",0,0,1,0,0,0
I don't know -- starting after 4 years.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"No, I think you'll see --",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you'll see more minority candidates and women candidates coming forward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is supposed to be the year of the women in the Senate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's see how they do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope a lot of --,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a fearless forecast.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A message just won't do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Colin Powell will be on somebody's ticket 4 years from now -- right?,0,0,1,0,0,0
He wanted that said -- 4 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, if won't be, General Waller would be -- you say, why do you keep picking military people.",0,0,1,0,0,0
These are people that I just happen to know and have a high regard for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm sure there are hundreds of others.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How about Dr. Lou Sullivan?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can think of many.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How about Sandra Day O'Connor as an example?,0,0,0,0,0,0
May I ask for an exception because I think we owe Carole Simpson -- anybody who can stand in between these three characters here and get the job done -- we owe her a round of applause.,0,0,0,0,0,0
(Applause) But don't take it out of my time!,0,0,0,0,0,0
I feel strongly about it because I don't want it to come out of my time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, but let me just stay to the American people in 2 and a half weeks we're going to choose who should sit in this Oval Office, who to lead the economic recovery, who to be the leader of the free world, who to get the deficit down.",0,0,0,0,0,1
three ways to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One is to raise taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One is to reduce spending -- controlling that mandatory spending.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Another one is to invest and save and to stimulate growth.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do not want to raise taxes.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I differ with the 2 here on that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm just not going to do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do believe that we need to control mandatory spending.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think we need to invest and save more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that we need to educate better and retrain better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe that we need to export more so I'll keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad and I believe that we must strengthen the family.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We've got to strengthen the family.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, let me pose this question to America.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If in the next 5 minutes a television announcer came on and said, there is a major international crisis -- there is a major threat to the world or in this country a major threat -- my question is, who, if you were appointed to name 1 of the 3 of us, who would you choose?",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Who has the perseverance, the character, the integrity, the maturity, to get the job done?",0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope I'm that person.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you very, very much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the American people want to do it and not talk about it, then they ought to -- you know, I'm one person they ought to consider.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Getting things done in three months that my competitors took 18 months to do.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Everybody says you can't do that with Congress.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Sure, you can do that with Congress.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Congress -- they're all good people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're all patriots but you've got to link arms and work with them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have them all day every day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we get the job done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don't have a chance go to this program when they're 3.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Now we're going back to when the mother's pregnant and they'll start right after they're born.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Starting when they're 3 and going to this school until they're 9 and then going into the public school in the 4th grade.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ninety percent are on the honor role.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Now that will change America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Those children will all go to college.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They will live the American dream.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn't have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they're unique and that they're precious and that there's only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, finally, if you can't pay the bills you're dead in the water.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have got to put our nation back to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, if you don't want to really do that I'm not your man.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"In other words, unless we're going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, just remember when you think about me -- I didn't create this mess.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've been paying taxes just like you and Lord knows, I've paid my share -- over a billion in taxes.",1,0,0,0,1,1
And for a guy that started out with everything he owned in the trunk of his car --,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it's in your hands.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll see you tomorrow night -- (Laughter) on NBC -- 10:30 to 11:00 Eastern Time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thank you, Carole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Since I suggested this format I hope it's been good for all of you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I really tried to be faithful to your request that we answer the questions specifically and pointedly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact you've had on making this a more positive experience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
These problems are not easy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're not going to be solved overnight.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But I want you to think about just 2 or 3 things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, the people of my state have let me be their governor for 12 years because I made commitments to 2 things -- more jobs and better schools.",1,0,0,0,0,1
Our schools are now better.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our children get off to a better start from pre-school programs and smaller classes in the early grades, and we have one of the most aggressive adult education programs in the country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty.",1,0,0,0,1,1
It happened because I could work with people -- Republicans and Democrats.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign.",1,0,0,0,0,1
You have to decide whether you want to change or not.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We do not need 4 more years of an economic theory that doesn't work.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We've had 12 years of trickle down economics.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"It's time to put the American people first, to invest and grow this economy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm the only person here who's ever balanced a government budget and I've presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly.,1,0,0,0,0,1
But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can do better than that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But let me just first, Cheryl, if you will, I want to thank Charlie for moderating.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to thank Washington University for hosting us here this evening.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Mr. President, it's good to be with you again this evening, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Cheryl, the president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And the result is that you've been bombarded with advertisements suggesting that I've changed a position on this or that or the other.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, the three things they try to say I've changed position on are the Patriot Act; I haven't.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"I just don't like the way John Ashcroft has applied it, and we're going to change a few things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No Child Left Behind Act, I voted for it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"Right here in St. Louis, you've laid off 350 teachers.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"You're 150 -- excuse me, I think it's a little more, about $100 million shy of what you ought to be under the No Child Left Behind Act to help your education system here.",1,0,0,0,0,1
So I complain about that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I've argued that we should fully funded it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The president says I've changed my mind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I haven't changed my mind: I'm going to fully fund it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So these are the differences.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, the president has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs.",1,0,1,0,1,1
The first president in 72 years to lose jobs.,1,0,0,0,1,0
I have a plan to put people back to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to close the loopholes that actually encourage companies to go overseas.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The president wants to keep them open.,1,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to give you a tax cut.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The president gave the top 1 percent of income-earners in America, got $89 billion last year, more than the 80 percent of people who earn $100,000 or less all put together.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"That's not wishy-washy, and that's what I'm fighting for, you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Charlie, thank you, and thank our panelists.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I can -- and thanks, Washington U. as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I can see why people at your workplace think he changes positions a lot, because he does.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it.",1,0,1,1,1,1
And that sends a confusing signal to people.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"He said he thought Saddam Hussein was a grave threat, and now he said it was a mistake to remove Saddam Hussein from power.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"No, I can see why people think that he changes position quite often, because he does.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, for a while he was a strong supporter of getting rid of Saddam Hussein.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"He saw the wisdom -- until the Democrat primary came along and Howard Dean, the anti-war candidate, began to gain on him, and he changed positions.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't see how you can lead this country in a time of war, in a time of uncertainty, if you change your mind because of politics.",0,0,1,0,0,0
He just brought up the tax cut.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"You remember we increased that child credit by $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, created a 10 percent tax bracket for the lower-income Americans.",1,0,1,0,1,1
That's right at the middle class.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And yet he tells you he's for a middle- class tax cut.,0,0,1,0,0,1
It's -- you've got to be consistent when you're the president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's a lot of pressures.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I know that Mr. Mondale, in the past, has made statements as if they were just people like ourselves, and if we were kind and good and did something nice, they would respond accordingly.",1,0,1,0,0,0

We canceled the B - 1 under the previous administration.,1,1,0,0,0,1
"The Soviet Union has been engaged in the biggest military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we tried the policy of unilateral disarmament, of weakness, if you will.",1,0,1,0,1,1

"And I've made it very plain to them, we seek no superiority.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"And I made it plain to them, we're not.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't want to send troops any place.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Because the only type of agreements to reach with the Soviet Union are the types that are specifically defined, so we know exactly what they must do; subject to full verification, which means we know every day whether they're living up to it; and followups, wherever we find suggestions that they're violating it; and the strongest possible terms.",1,0,1,0,0,1

There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I will keep this nation strong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength.",0,0,0,0,0,0

He's 3 years into this administration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He said he just discovered that most Soviet missiles are on land, and that's why his proposal didn't work.",1,0,1,0,1,1
I invite the American people tomorrow -- because I will issue the statement quoting President Reagan -- he said exactly what I said he said.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"He said that these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles because you could fire them, and you could recall them if you decided there'd been a miscalculation.",1,0,1,0,1,1
A President must know those things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We ought to deal with each of these countries separately.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That is a very important objective -- to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"And that's an image of strength -- except that if he had had his way when the Nimitz was being planned, he would have been deep in the water out there because there wouldn't have been any Nimitz to stand on -- he was against it.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"He was against the F - 14 fighter, he was against the M - 1 tank, he was against the B - 1 bomber, he wanted to cut the salary of all of the military, he wanted to bring home half of the American forces in Europe.",1,1,1,1,1,1

"It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why.",1,0,1,1,0,1
The plane wasn't flying the way it was supposed to be; it was a waste of money.,1,0,1,0,1,1
Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.,0,0,1,0,0,0
My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's a big difference between the two of us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A President must manage that budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"Similarly, in Central America: What we're doing in Nicaragua with this covert war -- which the Congress, including many Republicans, have tried to stop -- is finally end up with a public definition of American power that hurts us, where we get associated with political assassins and the rest.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"We have to decline, for the first time in modern history, jurisdiction in the World Court because they'll find us guilty of illegal actions.",0,0,1,0,0,1

It is only in that way that we can persevere.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What I'm referring to there is the mutual self-defense provisions that exist in the Inter-American treaty, the so-called Rio Pact, that permits the nations, our friends in that region, to combine to take steps -- diplomatic and otherwise -- to prevent Nicaragua, when she acts irresponsibly in asserting power in other parts outside of her border, to take those steps, whatever they might be, to stop it.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"The Nicaraguans must know that it is the policy of our government that that leadership must stay behind the boundaries of their nation, not interfere in other nations.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Israel could not be blamed for that.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Those terrorists had been violating their northern border consistently, and Israel chased them all the way to there.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And then the Government of Lebanon asked us back in as a stabilizing force while they established a government and sought to get the foreign forces all the way out of Lebanon and that they could then take care of their own borders.,1,0,0,0,0,1
We were there for the better part of a year.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our position happened to be at the airport.,0,0,0,0,0,1

We never initiated any kind of action; we defended ourselves there.,1,0,0,0,0,0

"We were succeeding, and that was why the terrorist acts began.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Then the multilateral force withdrew for only one reason: We withdrew because we were no longer able to carry out the mission for which we had been sent in.,1,0,1,0,1,1
But we went in in the interest of peace and to keep Israel and Syria from getting into the sixth war between them.,1,0,0,0,0,1

Let's talk about them separately.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Social Security is stable until, as you pointed out, at least the third decade of the next century.",1,0,0,0,0,1

And we will do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's obvious that there are certain things that have to be done and there are 50 or 60 different options, and a bipartisan commission to take it out of politics, will make recommendations and build support for the people.",0,0,1,0,0,1

That's more than it's had a lot of the time in the last years.,1,0,0,0,0,0

Then that would give us ten years to do with Medicare what we're going to do with Social Security; have a bipartisan group look at what we have to do to save it when the baby boomers retire.,0,0,0,0,0,1

It will probably have to be done by a commission.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take it out of politics.,0,0,1,0,0,0

Their idea was to have the poorest seniors in the country pay $270 more this year.,1,0,0,0,1,1
Their idea was a budget that the that the American Hospital Association said could close 700 hospitals.,1,1,0,1,1,1
Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"Not in an election year, sir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I told them in early '95.,0,0,0,0,0,0

What we need to do is make certain we try to return people to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants.,0,0,1,0,0,1
It puts a heavy burden on a state like -- except for emergencies.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It puts a heavy burden on a states like California.,1,0,1,0,1,0
It costs California taxpayers 3 billion dollars a year.,1,0,1,0,1,1
Let me get out of your way here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's illegal right now and has been for years for illegal immigrants to get welfare benefits.,1,0,1,0,0,1
Let me say that this is one of the most important issues in the world to me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I started working on welfare reform in 1980 because I was sick of seeing people trapped in a system that was increasingly isolating them and making their kids more vulnerable to get in trouble.,1,0,0,0,0,0
So I've been working on it when I was a governor for a long time.,1,0,0,0,0,0
When I became president I used the authority I had in this law to get out from certain federal rules to help states move people to work.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, I've got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's not a more important issue.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I, I still remember a woman that I met ten years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell, give an answer when they say, ""What does your mother do for a job?""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Well another thing we can do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got a great economic package which I hope we will discuss later.,0,0,0,0,0,0
$500 per child under 18.,1,0,0,0,0,1

"We've got to understand in America that we've got to have growth, create more jobs and more opportunities in the private sector.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The president takes credit for all these people off welfare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Federal government doesn't do that.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And the government doesn't create jobs.,0,0,1,0,1,1
They're created in the private sector.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"First of all, we have a big plan to reduce the capital gains tax when people sell their homes.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Part of my tax package which is paid for in my balanced budget plan would exempt up to half a million dollars in gains from people when they sell their homes, which I think is the biggest capital gains benefit we could give to most ordinary Americans.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We also have capital gains now for people that invest in new small businesses and hold the investment for five years.,1,0,0,0,0,1
It was part of our other economic plan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think the most important thing to emphasize, though, is that we also have to help people in other ways to build a strong economy and we can't have any tax cut that's not paid for.",0,0,0,0,0,1
One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I'm going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend and we've worked hard to bring this deficit down and that's helped people in the real estate business because the interest rates are lower.,1,0,0,0,0,1
We've got home ownership at a 15-year high.,1,1,0,0,0,1
We've got this country going in the right direction.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we can have a tax cut but my priority would be to help the families who need it with child rearing and education and buying a first-time home and helping for health care costs.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So from your business, helping in buying a first-time home, exempting the capital gains on the sale of the home would be the most important things that you asked about.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So the net tax increase in his plan's somewhere between 60 and 80 billion dollars.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless unless your home's worth over 500,000 dollars.",1,0,0,0,0,1

"Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it 28 percent to 14 percent.",0,0,0,0,1,1
There are 7 trillion dollars in assets locked up in America.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"If we cut the capital gains rate, I'm told everyday, I had a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in Kansas, I can't, because the capital gains rate's too high.",1,0,1,0,1,1
That'll help people who want to get off welfare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Before Senator Dole left the Senate, he and Mr. Gingrich also were recommending that we pass these tax cuts only insofar as we could pay for them.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"After he left the senate, we abandoned that.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"That's why most experts say that this tax scheme will blow a huge hole in the deficit, raise interest rates and weaken the economy and that will take away all the benefits of the tax cut with a weaker economy.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"That's why we have to balance the budget, and I will tell you how I'm going to pay for anything I promise you, line by line.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You should expect that from both of us.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people, rolled over and over and over, you, of course not this age, but if you have a child two years old, 7 percent interest would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college.",1,0,0,0,0,1
I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president.,0,0,1,0,0,0

Did you hear him say that Congress just voted to increase student loans and scholarships?,1,0,0,0,0,1

Because we reduced the deficit four years in a row.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"For the first time in the 20th century the President has done that in all four years and that's why I don't want to see us blow a big hole in the deficit with a tax program we can't pay for, so your interest rates will go up, and you'll have to pay back in higher interest rates what you allegedly will get in a tax cut, so I say keep working on expanding the markets.",1,0,1,0,0,1
More than half of these 10 and a half million new jobs are in higher wage areas and we'll have more manufacturing and sales around the world.,1,0,0,0,0,1

Let me just give you one tiny example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In San Diego where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project for the University of California San Diego to use airplane composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges, a little project in a program that Senator Dole opposed.",1,0,0,0,1,1

That's just one tiny example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe we will talk about some more before it's over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, one thing I did was oppose the government takeover health care that President Clinton offered in 1993, which created 17 new taxes and 50 new bureaucracies and price controls, because we were afraid the very thing you mentioned would have happened.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Everybody would have been forced into managed care.,0,0,1,0,0,0
You couldn't have chosen your own doctor and that would have been the end.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Maybe that's part of the answer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it seems to me if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else, then I think we've taken a giant step backward in the United States of America.",0,0,0,0,0,1

I hope not in both cases.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it does seem to me that you've raised a very important point that needs to be addressed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're going to have to watch it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Gonna have to take a look at all the managed care going on in California, or we're going to end up losing our best care that we have in the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Now that's not a government takeover.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That's like the family of medical-leave law; it just tries to set the rules of the game.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm strongly in favor of a federal bill to repeal any gag rules on providers.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, I don't have any quarrel with that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that would help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think what we want to avoid is falling back into this nationalized health care system that President Clinton wanted to give us in 1993.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"If that isn't a liberal idea, I've never heard one.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You know several states now are letting people vote over three weeks.,1,0,0,0,0,1
A lot of people are busy and it's hard for them to just get there and vote.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Third thing I think we need is more forums like this, which is one of the reasons I have so strongly supported campaign finance reform.",0,0,0,0,0,0

So I think we have to change the nature of politics.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The last thing I think we should do is something I have been trying to do since I have been president, is every time I do something in a public way, I try to have a real American citizen there who is directly affected by it so that people can see the connection of what happens way across the country, in Washington with more police on the street, in San Diego, clean up the sewage here in San Diego, doubling the border guards here in Southern California, that there is a connection between what we do way back there and what we do here.",1,0,0,0,0,1

It's going to help everything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let me make one other suggestion, because you're a teacher, you can have an impact on that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
One of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And there is a connection.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"We're doing that precisely, and I think one thing sooner or later we're going to have to consider is take a look at the Social Security system.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because we've got a lot of people advocating we don't want to put our money into Social Security.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You have to be very careful of that because you have to protect the people who are already in the pipeline.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's something you might consider.,0,0,0,0,0,0

It will probably happen in the year 2012 or 2015.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In 1983 we thought we had a 75 -year fix.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Much, much less, but at least we fixed it for some time and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time.",1,0,0,0,0,1
So we need to preserve the system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we need to make it stronger.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we also need to look at some options, whether or not we -- depending on what the options are.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Iris, this is one where we have some agreement, I think.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Only about half the people in this country have pension plans.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And Social Security is not enough for a lot of people to live on, or at least is not enough for them to maintain anything like their previous lifestyle.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So we've got to figure out how are we going to have more people with pension plans, and pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"So what, what is in my plan and I think it's almost identical in Senator Dole's plans is we make more people eligible to save in an IRA and let couples, married couples save more and then they could withdraw from it tax-free if they needed to, for medical emergencies or buy a home or education, but they could also save to supplement retirement.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"In addition to that, we just passed a sweeping small business reform that makes it easier for small business people to take out 401 K plans for themselves and employees and much easier for employees to carry it from job to job.",0,0,0,0,0,1
My best friend from grade school is a computer software salesman and he told me last time he changed employers it took him nine months to figure out how to transfer his 401K plan.,1,0,0,0,1,1

Did you say you're unemployed?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"See, the first thing we have to do is get you a job.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the economic package again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Reduce the capital gains rate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We want to make certain we protect those in the pipeline just as we did back in 1983 and we did it on a bipartisan basis.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We took it out of politics.,0,0,0,0,0,0
people get so tired of politics.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We ought to do the same with Medicare.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe we can make a deal here tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me tell you what we have done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have concluded with Japan 21 -- about to be 22 -- trade agreements now.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"And since we did that, in the areas where we concluded, trade agreements or exports to Japan have gone up by 85 percent in the last four years and our trade deficit with Japan has gone down.",1,0,0,0,1,1
Until about five months ago the Japanese economy was in a deep recession.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But I'm very -- that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're selling Japanese rice from California for the first time.,1,0,0,0,0,1
I visited a Chrysler dealership in Tokyo.,0,0,0,0,0,1

There's no easy way to do this when you're dealing with an economy that's traditionally been more closed than one that's traditionally been more open.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You have to gut it out, issue by issue by issue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We agreed in principle on an insurance agreement, and we're working on three or four other areas now, but the way you have to do it is make sure you're competitive.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We're the most competitive country in the world now, and then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale, and that's what our trade ambassador our commerce secretary and all the other people in our administration are trying to do.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, the bottom line is we have to stop exporting jobs here.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"There are 357, 000 good jobs -- manufacturing jobs, which are lost.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And I assume some of those are because of our trading partners.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We didn't have access to their markets.,1,0,0,0,0,1
We ought to insist on access.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we don't have access to their markets the same way they've access our markets, we ought to say, ""Wait, that's enough.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"It's very hard to get into the Japan market, as everybody knows.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They want to get into our market.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"They sell a lot of automobiles here, create a lot of jobs -- those who sell exports.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And that's very important to the economy, but I think we want to make certain.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I supported the President's trade policy.,1,0,0,0,0,0
But we got to be more aggressive.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Once you have a policy, then you have to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are American jobs that are being lost.,0,0,1,0,1,1

"By far, the largest number in American history -- not just the big ones you read about, but a lot of smaller ones.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And now what we have to do is to focus on those things we're real good at and make sure we're getting a fair deal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"So we have -- as we said, if you want to keep doing business and selling your products over here, you're going to have to quit pirating our CDs, and they agreed to do things and verify that they had done it, which will make the problem much better.",1,0,1,0,0,1
There is not a simple answer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have to work on this day in and day out, every month ,every year, every issue, to make sure that we have not only free trade but fair trade.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm proud that we're better off on that than we were four years ago.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well no doubt about it, our founding fathers had a great deal of wisdom.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"In addition to what you mentioned, they also were concerned about this all-powerful central government in Washington, D.C., that'd in effect confiscate your property, so -- I carry it in my pocket -- I can't pull it out or I'd violate the rules -- a copy of the Tenth Amendment which says we ought to return power to the states and the people, the people here.",0,0,1,0,1,1

"Honor, duty, and country, that's what America is all about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Certainly the President of the United States, the highest office in the world, the most important office in the world, has a responsibility to young people, as we talked about earlier.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And when it comes to public ethics, he has a responsibility.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you have 30-some in your administration, either left or being investigated or in jail or whatever, then you've got an ethical problem.",1,0,1,0,0,0
This is public ethics; I'm not talking about private ethics.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"When you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who is a bouncer in a bar and hired a security officer to collect files, in Watergate -- I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file.",1,0,1,0,1,1
There are 900 sequestered in the White House.,1,1,0,0,0,1
Why should they be rifling through your files?,0,0,1,0,0,0
The president has a great responsibility.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's one that I understand and certainly will carry out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is the most religious, great country in history.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"And now we have all these people just up the road in Los Angeles County, we have people from 150 different racial and ethnic groups and tons of different religions, but the fundamental tenets of virtually every religion are the same, and what I try to do is to support policies that would respect religion and then help parents inculcate those values to their children.",1,0,0,0,0,1
Let me very briefly give you some examples.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of my proudest moments was signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, that says the government has got to bend over backwards before we interfere with religious practice.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"I think it's -- before I came in, my wife and daughter and I had a prayer.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And that's the way it's always been, and that's the way it always will be.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to answer your question, but let me say one other thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We don't need a constitutional amendment for kids to pray, and what I did was to have the justice department and the education department for the first time ever issue a set of guidelines that we gave to every school in America, saying that children could not be interfered with in religious advocacy when they were praying, when they were doing whatever they could do under the constitution, just because they were on a public school ground, and I think anyone who's experienced this will tell you that our administration has done more than any in years to clarify the freedom of religion in the public square, including in the public schools.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It wouldn't be fair for me to do that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I would wind up -- I mean, it's the last question and I would mischaracterize it to try to make you happy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me tell you what I feel.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have a lot of differences in our country, and some of us believe that other people's decisions are wrong, even immoral.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"All over the world, people are being torn apart -- Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Burundi -- you name it -- because of all their differences.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We still have some of that hatred inside us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You see it in the church burnings.,0,0,0,0,1,0

"Well, I hope I made my answer clear.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I said I'm opposed to discrimination.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know we've suffered discrimination in the disability community.,0,0,0,0,0,1
There are 43 million of us.,1,0,0,0,1,1
And I can recall cases where people would cross the street rather than meet somebody in a wheelchair.,0,0,0,0,0,1
So we want to end discrimination.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think that answers itself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I would just say that it seems to me that that's the way it ought to be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We shouldn't discriminate -- race, color, whatever -- life-style, disability.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"We need to be disagreeing on ideas, honestly, and talking about the future.",0,0,0,0,0,0

So we have our differences.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We should have our differences.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We all agreed it would be a pretty dull place.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We should have more debates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe we will have another debate on the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I would just say this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is the highest honor that I have ever had in my life, to think that somebody from Russell, Kansas, somebody who grew up living in a basement apartment, someone whose parents didn't finish high school, somebody who spent about 39 months in hospitals after World War II, someone who uses a buttonhook every day to get dressed.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Somebody who understands that there're real Americans out there with real problems, whether soccer moms, or the single parents, the families or the seniors, or people with disabilities, whoever it may be.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I will just say my time is running out here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a very proud moment for me.,0,0,0,0,0,0

One thing I would like to say is I agree with what Senator Dole said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's a remarkable thing in a country like ours, a man who grew up in Russell, Kansas, and one who was born to a widowed mother in Hope, Arkansas, could wind up running for president.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.",1,0,1,0,0,1

"Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend.",1,0,1,0,1,1

"And, you know, Governor Romney, I'm glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to -- to kill them, to take them out of the picture.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But my strategy is broader than that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's -- that's important, of course.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And then we're going to have to get to a balanced budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We can't expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and small to take their life savings or their company's money and invest in America if they think we're headed to the road to Greece.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's where we're going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And finally, number five, we've got to champion small business.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Small business is where jobs come from.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.,1,0,0,0,1,1
New business formation is down to the lowest level in 30 years under this administration.,1,0,0,0,1,1
I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let's talk about what we need to compete.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think out of 50 states in Massachusetts, because the policies that you are promoting actually don't help small businesses.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And the way you define small businesses includes folks at the very top.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they include you and me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's not the kind of small business promotion we need.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But let's take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century and that's our education policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, under my leadership, what we've done is reformed education, working with governors, 46 states.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We've seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they're starting to finally make progress.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that we've fallen behind when it comes to math and science.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And those teachers can make a difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isn't going to help the economy grow.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes don't make a difference.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math.,1,0,0,0,0,0
First time one state had been number one in all four measures.,1,0,0,0,0,0
How did we do that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And that was -- that was -- that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation.,1,0,0,0,0,1
But that was 10 years before you took office.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And then you cut education spending when you came into office.,1,1,1,0,0,0
The first -- the first -- the first -- and we kept our schools number one in the nation.,1,0,0,0,1,1
They're still number one today.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And the principles that we put in place, we also gave kids not just a graduation exam that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to -- to be able compete, but also if they graduated the quarter of their class, they got a four-year tuition- free ride at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning.",1,0,0,0,1,1
That happened before you came into office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That was actually mine, actually, Mr. President.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You got that fact wrong.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way -- all the way through.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I'm going through from the very beginning -- we're going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The good news is (inaudible).,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd be happy to have you take a look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You look at how we get to a balanced budget within eight to 10 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We do it by getting -- by reducing spending in a whole series of programs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"There are a number of things that sound good, but frankly, we just can't afford them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that one doesn't sound good and it's not affordable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I'd get rid of that one from day one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To the extent humanly possible, we get that out.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"As a governor, I thought please, give me this program.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I can run this more efficiently than the federal government and states, by the way, are proving it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"States like Arizona, Rhode Island have taken these -- these Medicaid dollars; have shown they can run these programs more cost-effectively.",1,0,0,0,0,1
I want to do those two things and get this -- get this to a balanced budget with eight -- eight to 10 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the military -- let's get back to the military, though.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He should have answered the first question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, Governor Romney's called for $5 trillion of tax cuts that he says he's going to pay for by closing deductions.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, the math doesn't work, but he continues to claim that he's going to do it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
He then wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"And what I did was work with our joint chiefs of staff to think about, what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's the budget that we've put forward.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, what you can't do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"You say that you're going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions, without naming what those loopholes and deductions are.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And then somehow you're also going to deal with the deficit that we've already got.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The math simply doesn't work.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, we've got to think about capabilities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to be thinking about cyber security.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We need to be talking about space.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's exactly what our budget does, but it's driven by strategy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It's not driven by politics.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"It's not driven by members of Congress, and what they would like to see.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"It's driven by, what are we going to need to keep the American people safe?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern.",1,0,0,0,0,1
Because we've got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was on the world of business for 25 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I had the chance to be governor of a state.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We cut taxes 19 times and balanced our budget.,1,0,0,0,1,1
The president hasn't balanced a budget yet.,1,0,0,0,1,1
I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to be able to balance the budget.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's talk about military spending, and that's this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission.,1,0,0,0,1,1
We're now at under 285.,1,0,0,0,1,1
We're headed down to the low 200s if we go through a sequestration.,0,1,0,0,0,0
I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We've changed for the first time since FDR -- since FDR we had the -- we've always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once.,1,0,0,0,0,1

"Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget cuts the president has, as well as the sequestration cuts.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"That, in my view, is making -- is making our future less certain and less secure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Bob, I just need to comment on this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, the sequester is not something that I've proposed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is something that Congress has proposed.,0,0,0,0,0,1
The budget that we are talking about is not reducing our military spending.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's what are our capabilities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that you're putting forward because it just doesn't work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, we visited the website quite a bit and it still doesn't work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, Israel is a true friend.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It is our greatest ally in the region.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I've made that clear throughout my presidency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But to the issue of Iran, as long as I'm president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I made that clear when I came into office.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Their currency has dropped 80 percent.,1,0,0,0,1,1
Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago.,1,0,0,0,1,1
So their economy is in a shambles.,1,0,1,0,1,0
"And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security, and it is a threat to Israel's national security.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region of the world.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"And for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, that's unacceptable.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map.,1,0,1,0,1,1
So the work that we've done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we're not going to take any options off the table.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that, during the course of this campaign, he's often talked as if we should take premature military action.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"I think that would be a mistake, because when I've sent young men and women into harm's way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the president mad,e which is that if I'm President of the United States, when I'm President of the United States, we will stand with Israel.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran, there's no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"It presents a threat not only to our friends but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"It is also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were number one.",0,0,0,0,1,0
You're seeing it right now in the economy.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"It's absolutely the right thing to do, to have crippling sanctions.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I would have put them in place earlier.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it's good that we have them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can't come into our ports.",0,0,1,0,1,1
would agree with us as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Not only ships couldn't, but I'd say companies that are moving their oil can't, people who are trading in their oil can't.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I would tighten those sanctions further.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Secondly, I'd take on diplomatic isolation efforts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the Genocide Convention.,1,0,1,0,1,1
His words amount to genocide incitation.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I would indict him for it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a -- a -- a solution to this, which says -- which stops this -- this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And of course, a military action is the last resort.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is something one would only - only consider if all of the other avenues had been -- had been tried to their full extent.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, first of all those are reports in the newspaper.",0,0,1,0,0,1
But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations, and we would welcome that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There -- there are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision, but the deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that -- that would make a difference.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We started from the day we got into office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the reason is was so important -- and this is a testament to how we've restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Because if it's just us that are imposing sanctions -- we've had sanctions in place a long time.,0,0,1,0,1,1
It's because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And we've got to maintain that pressure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program.,0,0,1,0,1,1
There are inspections that are very intrusive.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the meantime, though, we're not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And one last thing -- just -- just to make this point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And I've been very clear to them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And that clock is ticking.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges we've had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration, and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year, he'd sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And then the president began what I have called an apology tour, of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.",1,0,0,1,1,0
I think they looked at that and saw weakness.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the president was silent.",0,0,1,0,1,1
I think they noticed that as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, we're just going to keep on spinning centrifuges.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"That's unacceptable for us, and it's essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They must not develop nuclear capability.,0,0,1,0,1,0
They need to be tightened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We need to indict Ahmadinejad.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Bob, let me just respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
This has been probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And every fact checker and every reporter who's looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, we've put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And -- and so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that we've been able to mobilize the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I came into office, the world was divided.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Iran is at its weakest point, economically, strategically, militarily, then since -- then in many years.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's in America's national interest and that will be the case so long as I'm president.,1,0,0,0,0,0
We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.,1,0,0,0,0,1
We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And -- and -- we should not have wasted these four years to the extent they -- they continue to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"And by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive.",0,0,1,0,1,1
You said that on occasion America had dictated to other nations.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations.",0,0,1,0,0,1
We have freed other nations from dictators.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"Bob, let me -- let me respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken -- when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And they can look at my track record, whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And that kind of credibility is precisely why we've been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the prime minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way, or their fighters are on the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"I look around the world, I don't see our influence growing around the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I see our influence receding, in part because of the failure of the president to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the -- the -- the turmoil with Israel.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I mean, the president received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying the tensions with Israel were a real problem.",1,0,1,0,1,1

"I mean, I'm -- I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan, now you're for it, although it depends.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there.",1,0,1,0,1,1

The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've seen progress over the past several years.,1,0,0,0,0,0
The surge has been successful and the training program is proceeding apace.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"There are now a large number of Afghan Security Forces, 350,000 that are ready to step in to provide security and we're going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014.",1,0,0,0,0,1
So our troops will come home at that point.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I can tell you at the same time, that we will make sure that we look at what's happening in Pakistan, and recognize that what's happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I say that because I know a lot of people that feel like we should just brush our hands and walk away.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I don't mean you, Mr. President, but some people in the -- in our nation feel that Pakistan is being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro mthem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world and to us, because Pakistan has 100 nuclear warheads and they're rushing to build a lot more.",1,0,0,0,0,1
They'll have more than Great Britain sometime in the -- in the relatively near future.,0,0,0,0,0,1
They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And so we're going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan, and we did deliver a surge of troops.",0,0,0,0,1,1
That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Part of what had happened is we'd forgotten why we had gone.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And so we decimated Al Qaida's core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.,1,0,0,0,0,1
We then started to build up Afghan forces.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, that transition has to take place in a responsible fashion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've been there a long time, and we've got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war it's time to do some nation building here at home.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what we can now do is free up some resources, to, for example, put Americans back to work, especially our veterans, rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools, making sure that, you know, our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And what we've said is let's change those certifications.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And as a consequence, veterans' unemployment is actually now lower than general population.",1,0,1,1,0,1
It was higher when I came into office.,1,0,0,0,1,0
So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because we're making that transition in Afghanistan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, it's not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point, a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani Network.",1,0,1,0,1,1
It's a nation that's not like -- like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is probably the most powerful of the -- of three branches there.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it -- if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there and you've got -- you've got terrorists there who could grab their -- their hands onto those nuclear weapons.",1,0,1,0,1,1
This is -- this is an important part of the world for us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Pakistan is -- is technically an ally, and they're not acting very much like an ally right now.",0,0,1,0,0,1
But we have some work to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I -- I don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.,1,0,1,0,0,0
We -- we had to go into Pakistan.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That was the right thing to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And -- and that upset them, but obviously there was a great deal of anger even before that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But we're going to have to work with the -- with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that they're on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's important for them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's important for the nuclear weapons.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It's important for the success of Afghanistan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because inside Pakistan, you have a -- a large group of Pashtun that are -- that are Taliban.",0,0,1,0,0,1
And that's one of the reasons the Afghan Security Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it's important for us to recognize that we can't just walk away from Pakistan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we do need to make sure that as we -- as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on -- on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And it's widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that and entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it, to continue to go after the people that represent a threat to this nation and to our friends.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"But let me also note that as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and -- and killing bad guys, important as that is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.,1,0,0,0,0,0
We haven't done that yet.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the -- the record, you look at the record.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You look at the record of the last four years and say is Iran closer to a bomb?,0,0,1,0,1,1
Is the Middle East in tumult?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Is -- is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Is -- are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, they haven't had talks in two years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn't just going after bin Laden.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have stood on the side of democracy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation -- me, my administration -- stood with them earlier than just about any country.",1,0,0,0,0,0
In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy.,1,0,0,0,0,1
In Libya we stood on the side of the people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as a consequence, there's no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And we want to shrink those groups and those networks and we can do that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we're always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office.",1,0,1,0,1,0
And they don't have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But with respect to China, China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas; businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade.,1,0,1,0,1,1
And that's the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other -- the previous administration had done in two terms.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"And we've won just about every case that we've filed, that has been decided.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact, just recently steelworkers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest -- Pennsylvania -- are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case.",1,0,1,0,1,1
We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires -- or -- or cheap Chinese tires.,1,0,1,0,1,1
And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America.,1,0,0,0,0,1
I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"But I tell you, those workers don't feel that way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, we've also got to make sure, though, that we're taking -- taking care of business here at home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we don't have the best education system in the world, if we don't continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that's how we lose the competition.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And, unfortunately, Governor Romney's budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, first of all, it's not government that makes business successful.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It's not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"China has an interest that's very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world.",0,0,0,0,0,1
They don't want to see protectionism.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"They don't want to see the world break out into -- into various forms of chaos, because they have to -- they have to manufacture goods and put people to work and they have about 20,000 -- 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year coming into the cities, needing jobs.",1,0,1,0,1,1
So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so we can be a partner with China.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We can work with them, we can collaborate with them, if they're willing to be responsible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, they look at us and say, Is it a good idea to be with America?",0,0,0,0,0,0
How strong are we going to be?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How strong is our economy?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They look at the fact that we owe 'em a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including that.",1,0,1,0,1,1
They look at our -- our decision to -- to cut back on our military capabilities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"It's not my term, it's the president's own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"It's not my term, it's the president's own Secretary of Defense, called them devastating.",1,0,1,0,1,0
"They look at America's commitments around the world and they see what's happening, and they say, well, OK. Is America going to be strong?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the answer is, yes, if I'm president, America will be very strong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We'll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency.",1,0,1,0,1,1
It holds down the prices of their goods.,1,0,0,0,0,1
It means our goods aren't as competitive and we lose jobs.,0,1,1,0,0,1
They're making some progress; they need to make more.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why on day one, i will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.",1,0,1,0,1,1
They have to understand we want to trade with them.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We want a world that's stable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, they sell us about this much stuff every year, and we sell them about this much stuff every year.",0,0,1,0,1,1
So it's pretty clear who doesn't want a trade war.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And there's one going on right now, which we don't know about it.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"We have enormous trade imbalance with China, and it's worse this year than last year, and it's worse last year than the year before.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to say to our friend in China, look, you guys are playing aggressively.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But this can't keep on going.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"I was with one company that makes valves and -- and process industries and they said, look, we were -- we were having some valves coming in that -- that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and -- and they had our serial number on them.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor.",1,0,1,0,1,1
I want a great relationship with China.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"China can be our partner, but -- but that doesn't mean they can just roll all over us and steal our jobs on an unfair basis.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, Governor Romney's right, you are familiar with jobs being shipped overseas because you invested in companies that were shipping jobs overseas.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"And, you know, that's -- you're right.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I mean that's how our free market works.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I've made a different bet on American workers.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"If we had taken your advice Governor Romney about our auto industry, we'd be buying cars from China instead of selling cars to China.",0,0,0,0,0,0
If we take your advice with respect to how we change our tax codes so that companies that earn profits overseas don't pay U.S. taxes compared to companies here that are paying taxes.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Now that's estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won't be here, they'll be in places like China.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Now with respect to what we've done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993.",1,0,0,0,1,1
We absolutely have to make more progress and that's why we're going to keep on pressing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when it comes to our military and Chinese security, part of the reason that we were able to pivot to the Asia-Pacific region after having ended the war in Iraq and transitioning out of Afghanistan, is precisely because this is going to be a massive growth area in the future.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And we believe China can be a partner, but we're also sending a very clear signal that America is a Pacific power; that we are going to have a presence there.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues.",0,0,0,0,0,1
And we're organizing trade relations with countries other than China so that China starts feeling more pressure about meeting basic international standards.,1,0,0,0,0,1
That's the kind of leadership we've shown in the region.,1,0,0,0,0,0
That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I just want to take one of those points, again, attacking me as not talking about an agenda for -- for getting more trade and opening up more jobs in this country.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Nothing could be further from the truth.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm a son of Detroit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry.,0,0,1,0,0,0
My plan to get the industry on its feet when it was in real trouble was not to start writing checks.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was President Bush that wrote the first checks.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I said they need -- these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy.,0,0,0,0,1,1
"And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd -- they'd built up.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Governor Romney, that's not what you said...",1,0,1,0,0,0
"Governor Romney, you did not...",0,0,1,0,0,0
You did not say that you would provide government help.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"I said that we would provide guarantees, and -- and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy, to come out of bankruptcy.",1,0,0,0,1,1
Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"But there are a lot of parents who feel like everything is going well in their child's school, and all of a sudden they wake up and realize that wait a minute, standards aren't being met.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's why I'm so strong for accountability.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe we ought to measure a lot, three, four, five, six, seven, eighth grade.",0,0,0,0,0,0

You can't solve a problem unless you diagnose it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I strongly believe that one of the best things to encourage parental involvement also is to know that the classrooms will be safe and secure.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why I support a teacher liability act at the federal level, that says if a teacher or principal upholds reasonable standards of classroom discipline they can't be sued.",1,0,0,0,0,1

We can't continue to shuffle children through school.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And one of the consequences to allow parents to have different choices.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have huge difference between us on this question.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'd like to start by telling you what my vision is.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Where there are no failing schools, where the classrooms are small enough in size, number of students, so that the teacher can spend enough one-on-one time with each student.",0,0,0,0,0,1
Now that means recruiting new teachers for the public schools.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It means in my plan hiring bonuses to get 100,000 new teachers in the public schools within the next four years.",1,0,0,0,0,1

"Now, I said there was a contrast.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Governor Bush is for vouchers, and in his plan he proposes to drain more money, more taxpayer money out of the public schools for private school vouchers than all of the money that he proposes in his entire budget for public schools themselves.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And only one in 20 students would be eligible for these vouchers, and they wouldn't even pay the full tuition to private school.",1,0,0,0,1,1
I think that's a mistake.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I don't think we should give up on the private schools and leave kids trapped in failing schools.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"First of all, vouchers are up to states.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I strongly believe in local control of schools.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm a governor of state and I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe in local control of schools.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But here's what I said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've said to the extent we spend federal money on disadvantaged children, we want the schools to show us whether or not the children are learning.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We expect there to be standards met and we expect there to be measurement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And if we find success we'll praise it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when we find children trapped in schools that will not change and will not teach, instead of saying oh, this is okay in America just to shuffle poor kids through schools, there has to be a consequence.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent, so the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"You see, there has to be a consequence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We've got a society that says hey, the status quo is fine, just move them through.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Described under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, you're -- and the way it would happen is that under his plan, if a school was designated as failing, the kids would be trapped there for another three years and then some of them would get federal vouchers and the state would be forced to match those, that money.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Under my plan, if a school is failing, we work with the states to give them the authority and the resources to close down that school and reopen it right away with a new principal, a new faculty, a turn-around team of specialists who know what they're doing.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"It's based on the plan of Governor Jim Hunt in North Carolina, and it works great.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"If I thought that there was no alternative, then I might feel differently.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But I have an obligation to fight to make sure there are no failing schools.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to turn around -- most schools are excellent, but we have to make sure that all of them are.",0,0,0,0,0,1
What grade do you teach?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I mentioned before that the local communities are having a harder time passing bond issues.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Traditionally, if you've been involved in a campaign like that, you know that the parents with kids in school are the ones that turn out and vote.",0,0,0,0,0,0

And it's the largest number ever this year and they'll break the record next year and every year for ten years running.,1,0,0,0,1,1
We've got to do something about this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And local -- it's not enough to leave it up to the local school districts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They're not able to do it and our future depends upon it.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"Look, we're in an information age.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Our economic future depends upon whether or not our children are going to get the kind of education that lets them go on to college.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And again, I want to make it possible for all middle-class families to send their kids to college and more Pell grants for those who are in the lower income groups also, and then I want to make sure that we have job training on top of that and lifelong learning, but it all starts with the public school teachers.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"My proposal gives $10,000 hiring bonuses for those teachers who are -- who get certified to teach in the areas where they're most needed.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, accountability, we basically agree on accountability.",0,0,0,0,0,0
My plan requires testing of all students.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It also requires something that Governor Bush's plan doesn't.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"It requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to start treating teachers like the professionals that they are, and give them the respect and the kind of quality of life that will draw more people into teaching because we need a lot more teachers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you total up all the federal spending he wants to do, it's the largest increase in federal spending in years.",1,0,0,0,1,1
And there's just not going to be enough money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what governors ought to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The federal government puts about 6% of the money up.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"They put about, you know, 60% of the strings where you have to fill out the paperwork.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"I don't know if you have to be a paperwork filler-outer, but most of it's because of the federal government.",0,0,1,0,0,0
What I want to do is to send flexibility and authority to the local folks so you can choose what to do with the money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One size does not fit all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I worry about federalizing education if I were you.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We need to demand on results.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I hear from teachers all the time about the lawsuits and the threats, respect in the classroom.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Part of it's because you can't -- you can't control the classroom.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You can't have a consequence for somebody without fear of getting sued under federal law.,1,0,0,0,0,0
So I'm going to ask the Congress to pass a teacher protection act.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I believe in flexibility, I believe in a national reading initiative for local districts to access with K through 2 diagnostic testing, curriculum that works, phonics works, by the way, it needs to be a part of our curriculum.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There needs to be flexibility for teacher training and teacher hiring with federal money.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"The federal government can be a part, but don't fall prey to all this stuff about money here and money there because education is really funded at the local level.",1,0,0,0,0,1
94% comes from the local level.,1,0,0,0,0,1
I'm so glad that I have the chance to knock that down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, the problem is that under Governor Bush's plan, $1.6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, under his own budget numbers, he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1% than all the new money he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Now under my plan we'll balance the budget every year.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not just saying this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years, paid down the debt.",1,0,0,0,0,1

"One reason is, you know, the third biggest spending item in our budget is interest on the national debt?",1,0,1,0,0,1
We get nothing for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We keep the good faith and credit of the United States.,0,0,0,0,0,0
That gets rid of the third biggest intrusion of the federal government in our economy.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, because the governor has all this money for a tax cut mostly to the wealthy, there is no money left over, so schools get testing and lawsuit reform and not much else.",1,0,1,0,0,1
(LAUGHTER) Just add up all the numbers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's three times bigger than what President Clinton proposed.,1,0,1,0,1,1

He proposed more than Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis combined.,1,0,0,0,1,1
This is a big spender.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And he ought to be proud of it, it's part of his record.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We just have a different philosophy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me talk about tax relief.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The Vice President believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"I think if you're going to have tax relief, everybody ought to get it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But the top 1% will end up paying one-third of the taxes in America and they get one-fifth of the benefits.,1,0,1,0,1,1
And that's because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"If you're a family of four making $50,000 in Missouri, you get a 50% cut in your federal income taxes.",1,0,0,0,0,1
What I've done is set priorities and funded them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It's a difference of opinion.,0,0,1,0,0,0
He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's just the right position to take.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can we take the time --,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you pay taxes, you are going to get a benefit.",0,0,0,0,0,1
People who pay taxes will get tax relief.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Under my plan, if you make -- the top -- the wealthy people pay 62% of the taxes today.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year today and you're trying to raise two children, for every additional dollar you earn you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making $200,000, and that's not right.",1,0,0,0,0,1
So I want to do something about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, this isn't about Governor Bush, it's not about me.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I want to come back to something I said before.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you want somebody who believes that we were better off eight years ago than we are now and that we ought to go back to the kind of policies that we had back then, emphasizing tax cuts mainly for the wealthy, here is your man.",0,0,1,0,0,1

"I won't ask you, but if you do, you're in the top 1%.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm not going to ask them.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But if everyone here in this audience was dead on in the middle of the middle-class, then the tax cuts for every single one of you all added up would be less than the tax cut his plan would give to just one member of that top wealthiest 1%.",1,0,1,0,0,1
Now you judge for yourselves whether or not that's fair.,0,0,0,0,0,0
50 million Americans get no tax relief under his plan.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"You may not be one of them, you're just not one of the right people.",0,0,0,0,0,0

You talk about eight years?,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's time to get something done.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We can't put the Middle East peace process on our timetable.,0,0,1,0,0,0

Some of the hardest moments since I've been the governor of the State of Texas is to deal with those cases.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Is the person guilty of the crime?,0,0,1,0,0,0

There's too much bitterness in Washington.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It's time to have a fresh start.,0,0,0,0,0,0

And then I brought folks together to get it done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that's what we need, I think, in this election.",0,0,0,0,0,0
To me that's what it's all about.,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's one of my promises.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it's gonna require people to bring both Republicans and Democrats together to get it done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There was a chance to get this done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was a bipartisan approach, but it's been rejected.",1,0,1,0,0,0
I'm going to bring them together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, Jim, I would like to respond to what the governor just said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because the trillion dollars that has been promised to young people has also been promised to older people.,1,0,0,0,1,1
And you cannot keep both promises.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you're in your mid-40's under the governor's plan, Social Security will be bankrupt by the time you retire, if he takes it out of the Social Security Trust Fund.",1,1,0,0,1,1
Under my plan it will be -- its solvency will be extended until you're 100.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Now that is the difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"This election is not about debating tricks, it is about your future.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The reason Social Security -- he says it gets 2%.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"You know, it's not a bank account that just pays back money that's invested.",0,0,0,0,0,1
It is also used to give your mothers and fathers the Social Security checks that they live on.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"If you take a trillion dollars out of that Social Security Trust Fund, how are the checks going to be -- how are you going to keep faith with the seniors?",0,0,0,0,0,1
Now let me come directly to your question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One reason people are skeptical is because people don't answer the questions they've been asked.,0,0,1,0,0,0
The trillion dollars comes out of the surplus so that you can invest some of your own money.,1,0,0,0,0,1
There's just a difference of opinion.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I want workers to have their own assets.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's who you trust, government or people.",0,0,0,0,0,0

It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.",1,0,0,0,0,1
Our airports are like from a third world country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So the worst of all things has happened.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And it's really a shame.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Our country has tremendous problems.,0,0,0,0,1,0
We're a serious debtor nation.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.",1,0,1,0,0,0
And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And the other thing I think is important...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It would be squandered, too, believe me.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.",1,0,0,0,1,1
We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It immediately was put to use.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...",0,0,1,0,0,0
Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Which our country should do, too.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?",0,0,1,0,1,0
I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.",1,1,0,1,1,1
There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.,0,0,0,0,0,1
You call yourself the King of Debt.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.,1,0,1,1,0,1
"Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we need to be very clear about that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I built an unbelievable company.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's what I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll give you an example.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.",0,0,0,0,0,1
But we're opening the Old Post Office.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I'm a year ahead of schedule.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And that's what this country should be doing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.",0,0,0,0,0,1
The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And we should be able to do that for our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Race remains a significant challenge in our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.",1,0,1,0,1,1
We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.,0,0,0,0,0,1
And we've got to do several things at the same time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to restore trust between communities and the police.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.",1,0,1,1,1,1
"So we have to do two things, as I said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to restore trust.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to work with the police.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And we need law and order.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.",0,0,0,0,1,1
"We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"You walk down the street, you get shot.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.",1,0,0,1,1,1
"And I'm saying, where is this?",0,0,1,0,0,0
Is this a war-torn country?,0,0,1,0,1,0
And we have to stop the violence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to bring back law and order.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.",1,1,1,0,1,1
We have to bring back law and order.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.",1,0,0,0,0,1
It brought the crime rate way down.,1,0,1,0,0,0
But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We have gangs roaming the street.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And we have to be very strong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have to be very vigilant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.",1,0,1,0,1,0
It was taken away from her.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.",1,0,1,0,0,1
They would have won an appeal.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"You need a better community, you know, relation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You don't have good community relations in Chicago.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.",0,0,0,0,0,1
I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.",0,0,1,0,1,1
So there's some bad things going on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.",1,1,1,0,0,0
It did not do what it needed to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, I believe in community policing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Property crime is down 40 percent.,1,0,1,0,1,1
We just don't want to see it creep back up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.",1,0,1,1,1,1
So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We cannot just say law and order.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.",0,0,1,0,0,1
We need to have more second chance programs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.,1,0,0,0,1,1
You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So there are some positive ways we can work on this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.",0,0,0,0,0,0
They admit it's an issue.,0,0,1,0,0,0
They've got a lot of concerns.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.",1,0,0,0,0,0
And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd like to respond to that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think you've apologized for it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
But I think it was a terrible thing to say.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we went from 2,200 to 500.",1,0,0,0,1,1
And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And it was terminated by current mayor.,1,0,0,0,1,1
But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.,1,0,0,0,1,0
"So when you say it has no impact, it really did.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"It had a very, very big impact.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.",1,1,1,0,1,1
New York -- New York has done an excellent job.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, one murder is too many.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd like to just respond, if I might.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'd just like to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.",0,0,1,0,1,1
They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, I -- I do think...",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You decided to stay home, and that's OK.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you, I've been all over.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And you know what else I prepared for?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I prepared to be president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think that's a good thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.",0,1,1,0,1,0
"Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.",1,1,0,0,1,1
They were pressing it very hard.,1,0,0,1,1,0
She failed to get the birth certificate.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"When I got involved, I didn't fail.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I got him to give the birth certificate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I'm satisfied with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But nobody was caring much about it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And I think I did a good job.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton also fought it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.",0,1,0,0,0,1
"But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, it was very -- I say nothing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He should have produced it a long time before.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But let me just tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you can see that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, just listen to what you heard.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But it can't be dismissed that easily.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.",1,0,1,1,1,1

And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.,0,0,1,0,0,0

I would love to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You treated him with terrible disrespect.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It doesn't work that way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.",1,0,1,0,1,0
I don't think you can deny that.,0,0,1,0,0,0

We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.,1,0,0,0,1,1
It was very easy to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I notice you bring that up a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Maybe I'm trying to save the money.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.",1,0,1,0,1,1
I'll go one step further.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.",1,0,1,0,0,1
The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...",0,0,1,0,1,0
"And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.",1,0,1,0,1,1

We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But we will defend the citizens of this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the Russians need to understand that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.,1,0,1,1,0,0
It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...,1,0,1,0,0,1
... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.,1,0,1,0,0,0
It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.,0,0,1,0,0,0

You don't know who broke in to DNC.,0,0,1,0,1,1

"Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It does involve going after them online.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Our military is assisting in Iraq.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.,1,0,1,0,0,0
We will take out ISIS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.",0,0,1,0,1,1
So she talks about taking them out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's been doing it a long time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's been trying to take them out for a long time.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And then you wouldn't have had them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.,1,0,1,0,1,0
That is absolutely proved over and over again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.",1,0,0,1,0,0
"But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.",0,0,1,0,1,1
"But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the most important part of this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How do we prevent attacks?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How do we protect our people?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they brought him down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.",1,0,0,0,0,1

"Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.",1,0,1,0,0,0
They're on the front lines.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I have to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Under your direction, to a large extent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.",1,0,1,0,0,1
They were choking on the sanctions.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?",0,0,0,0,0,0

But I have common sense.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I said, well, I'll tell you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And I was very strong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I said it numerous times.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And I think that's great.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.,1,0,0,0,1,1
It's a lot of money to protect other people.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But I'm all for NATO.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I said they have to focus on terror, also.",0,0,1,1,0,0
And they're going to do that.,0,0,0,1,0,0
And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.,0,0,1,1,1,0
"I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.",1,1,0,0,0,0
"Not only that, you named the day.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.",0,0,1,0,0,0

It should have never happened.,0,0,1,0,0,0

I did not support the war in Iraq.,1,0,1,1,1,0

Just -- would you like to hear...,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was against the war in Iraq.,1,1,1,0,0,0
Just so you put it out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The record does not show that.,1,0,1,0,1,1
The record shows that I'm right.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?",0,0,1,0,0,0

And that was before the war started.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I was against the war.,1,1,0,0,0,0

"And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But nobody called Sean Hannity.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.",0,0,1,0,0,1
But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.",1,0,1,0,0,0

He and I used to have arguments about the war.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It's going to destabilize the Middle East.,0,0,1,0,0,0

You didn't hear what I said.,0,0,1,0,0,0

I have a winning temperament.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I know how to win.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She does not have a...,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.",1,0,1,0,0,1
They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.,1,0,1,0,0,1
They had built covert facilities.,1,0,1,0,0,1
They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we had sanctioned them.,1,0,0,0,1,0
"I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.",1,0,1,0,0,1
So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.,1,0,1,0,1,1
And we did drive them to the negotiating table.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.",1,0,1,1,1,1
That's working with other nations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.",0,0,1,0,1,1

That would not start a war.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"No, they were taunting us.",0,0,1,0,0,0
... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.",0,0,1,0,0,1

"... have a good time, folks.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.",0,0,1,0,0,0
That is the number-one threat we face in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's a good one, though.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It well describes the problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not an accurate one at all.,0,0,1,0,0,0
It's not an accurate one.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with her on one thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.",0,0,1,0,0,1
Nuclear is the single greatest threat.,0,0,1,0,0,1

They do not pay us.,1,0,1,1,1,1
"But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.",1,0,1,0,0,1

"I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Well, wait, but it's very important.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're a country that owes $20 trillion.,1,0,0,0,0,1
They have to help us out.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It is the single greatest threat that this country has.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I would certainly not do first strike.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"At the same time, we have to be prepared.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I can't take anything off the table.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.",0,0,1,0,0,1
China should solve that problem for us.,0,0,0,0,0,0
China should go into North Korea.,0,0,0,0,1,0
China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.,0,0,0,1,0,1
"And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.",1,0,1,0,0,0
Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.,1,0,0,0,0,1
Iran has power over North Korea.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't you add other things into the deal?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.",1,1,0,1,0,0
Nobody's ever seen that before.,0,0,1,0,0,0
That turned out to be wrong.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.",1,1,1,0,0,1
It certainly looks that way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?",0,0,1,0,0,0
This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.,0,0,0,0,1,1
The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they're going to end up getting nuclear.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Believe me, he's not a happy camper.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Words matter when you run for president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And they really matter when you are president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is essential that America's word be good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've talked with a number of them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And Donald never tells you what he would do.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Would he have started a war?,0,0,1,0,1,0
Would he have bombed Iran?,0,0,1,0,1,0
"If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.",1,0,1,0,0,0
But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.",0,0,1,0,1,0
So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Can they rely on us?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what I intend to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...,0,0,1,0,0,0
... to be given any opportunities at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Lester, one thing I'd like to say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will go very quickly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And it's a big problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We cannot be the policemen of the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We cannot protect countries all over the world...,0,0,1,0,0,0
... where they're not paying us what we need.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We need a lot of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But you have to have some basic ability.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And sadly, she doesn't have that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they weren't taken care of.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She doesn't have the look.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She doesn't have the stamina.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I said she doesn't have the stamina.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And I don't believe she does have the stamina.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.",0,0,0,0,0,0
You have -- wait a minute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You asked me a question.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Did you ask me a question?,0,0,0,0,0,0
You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?",0,0,1,0,1,0
"And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?",0,0,1,0,1,0
All you have to do is speak to them.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.",0,0,1,0,0,0
The world -- let me tell you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But it's bad, bad experience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"She's got experience, but it's bad experience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...",1,0,1,1,1,0
.... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.,0,0,1,0,0,1
And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And he called this woman ""Miss Piggy.""",1,0,0,0,1,0
"Then he called her ""Miss Housekeeping,"" because she was Latina.",1,0,0,0,1,0
"Donald, she has a name.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Where did you find this?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Where did you find this?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Her name is Alicia Machado.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Where did you find this?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...",0,0,0,0,0,0
... she's going to vote this November.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just tell you...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Some of it's said in entertainment.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you want to know the truth?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was going to say something...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ""I can't do it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I just can't do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.",1,0,1,0,1,0
"And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I don't deserve that.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's hundreds of millions of ads.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...",0,0,0,0,0,1
"... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, I support our democracy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to make America great again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to be able to do it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't believe Hillary will.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I actually agree with that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with everything she said.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This is a great country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a great land.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And my whole concept was to make America great again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"In other words, trading with other countries.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We had an $800 billion deficit.,1,1,1,1,1,1
You say who's making these deals?,0,0,1,0,0,0
We're going the make great deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have a strong border.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to bring back law and order.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And this is happening on a weekly basis.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's called make America great again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I didn't say that at all.",0,0,1,0,1,0
I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm not proud of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I apologize to my family.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I apologize to the American people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Certainly I'm not proud of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But this is locker room talk.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And they look and they see.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?",0,0,1,0,0,0
And they look at our country and they see what's going on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I will knock the hell out of ISIS.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We're going to defeat ISIS.,0,0,1,0,0,0
ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have great respect for women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody has more respect for women than I do.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I was embarrassed by it.,0,0,0,0,1,0
But I have tremendous respect for women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And women have respect for me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will tell you: No, I have not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We're going to make America safe again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.",1,0,1,0,0,1
And that's what I want to talk about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.,1,0,0,0,0,1
And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have seen him insult women.,1,0,1,1,1,0
"We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.",1,0,0,0,1,1
We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.,1,0,1,0,1,0
"We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.",1,0,0,0,1,0
"So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.",1,0,0,1,1,1
So this is who Donald Trump is.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Am I allowed to respond to that?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.",1,0,1,1,0,1
"I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm going to help the African-Americans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I am going to help the inner cities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.,1,0,0,0,0,1
She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"It was locker room talk, as I told you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That was locker room talk.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I'm not proud of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And certainly, I'm not proud of it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that was something that happened.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Mine are words, and his was action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
His was what he's done to women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.",0,1,1,0,1,0
Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.,1,0,1,0,1,0
Four of them here tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.",0,1,1,0,1,1
"Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.",1,1,0,1,0,0
"Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So don't tell me about words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it is things that people say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"(APPLAUSE) And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.",1,0,0,0,1,1
And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.,1,0,1,0,1,0
"He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, ""Mexican.""",1,0,0,0,1,1

"He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.",0,1,1,1,1,1
So you really owe him an apology.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.",1,0,0,0,1,0
"That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.",0,0,0,0,1,0
I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.,0,0,0,0,0,0

And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.",1,0,1,0,1,0

People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.,0,0,1,0,1,1

We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.,0,0,1,0,0,0

Because you'd be in jail.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.",1,0,0,0,0,1
She got it from the United States Congress.,1,0,0,0,0,1

... on some of the issues that people care about tonight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let's get to their questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it hasn't been finished at all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's nice to -- one on three.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If he wants to start, he can start.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Premiums have gotten too high.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.",1,0,0,0,1,1
But that in and of itself was a good thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.",1,1,0,0,0,1
So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we've got to get costs down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And then we would have to start all over again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.",1,0,0,1,1,1
That's the highest we've ever been in our country.,1,0,0,1,1,0

"It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.,1,0,1,0,0,1
Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.,1,0,1,0,1,0
"In '17, it implodes by itself.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"It's very bad, very bad health insurance.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.",0,0,0,0,1,0
It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.",1,0,1,0,1,1
You will have the finest health care plan there is.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.",1,1,0,1,1,1
"And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.",1,0,1,0,1,1
It's catastrophic in certain ways.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.,1,0,1,0,0,0
Obamacare was the first step.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Obamacare is a total disaster.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But we have an employer-based system.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.",0,0,0,0,0,1
That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...",0,0,1,0,0,0
"... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...",0,0,0,0,0,0
... you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.",0,0,1,0,0,0
That's not going to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to be able to.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You're going to have plans...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I'll tell you what it means.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.",1,0,0,0,1,0
"The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.",1,0,1,0,0,0

"And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We're going to block grant into the states.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.",0,0,1,0,0,0

Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I want to say just a couple of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And we've had many successful Muslims.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We are not at war with Islam.,1,0,1,0,0,0
And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.",1,0,0,0,0,1
So he would have been alive today.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.,0,0,1,0,0,1
Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.,0,0,1,0,1,0
Why don't you interrupt her?,0,0,1,0,0,0
We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.,1,0,0,0,0,1

"People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.",1,0,0,1,1,0

And we need to do our part.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.",1,0,1,0,0,0

We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.,0,0,0,0,0,1
How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?,0,0,0,0,0,0

So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.",1,0,1,1,1,1

The entire press corps has looked at it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.",1,0,1,0,0,0
That has not been debunked.,1,0,1,0,1,1

And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...,0,0,0,0,0,1
... with the Russians and other foreign powers.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.",1,0,1,0,1,0
That's one that I haven't...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's a big, big difference.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're talking about some difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin.",1,0,1,1,1,0
"I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But I don't know Putin.,1,0,1,1,1,0
"But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.",1,1,1,0,0,1
Maybe there is no hacking.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But they always blame Russia.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I know nothing about Russia.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I have no businesses there.,1,0,0,0,1,0
I have no loans from Russia.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But I have no loans with Russia.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Many of her friends took bigger deductions.,1,0,1,0,1,0
Warren Buffett took a massive deduction.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.",1,0,1,0,1,0
Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions.,1,0,1,0,1,0
I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll be very proud to.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And she could have done this years ago, by the way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She's a United States -- she was a United States senator.,0,0,0,0,0,1
She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, why didn't she change it?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.",1,0,1,0,0,0
But -- and I say that about a lot of things.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I wish you would have done this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And she never will change.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.",1,0,0,0,0,1
We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.,0,0,0,0,0,1
But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.,1,0,0,0,0,1
We're cutting taxes for the middle class.,0,1,0,0,0,0
"And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.",1,1,1,0,0,0
You can look at me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's raising your taxes really high.,0,1,0,0,1,0
And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.,0,0,1,0,0,0
But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes.,1,1,1,0,1,0
That in itself is a big difference.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to be thriving again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have no growth in this country.,1,0,1,0,1,1
"If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.",0,0,1,0,1,1
We're down at 1 percent.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"And that's, like, no growth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we're going lower, in my opinion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.",1,0,1,1,1,1
And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.,1,1,1,0,1,0
"Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.,1,0,0,0,0,0
But I'll tell you what he's going to do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, here's what I want to do.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.",1,0,0,0,0,1
And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.",1,0,1,0,1,0
"I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.",1,0,1,0,0,0
I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's called the Buffett rule.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.",1,0,1,0,0,1
I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I want to invest in hard-working families.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.",1,1,0,0,1,1
And we need to reverse that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I know many of her donors.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Her donors took massive tax write-offs.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.",1,0,1,0,0,1
"But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.",0,0,1,0,0,0
Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.",0,0,1,0,0,1
So we won't make them famous.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, she's given it to us.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I say it all the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She talks about health care.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't she do something about it?,0,0,1,0,0,0
Why didn't she do something about it?,0,0,1,0,0,0
She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With her, it's all talk and no action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.",0,0,1,0,0,0
She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, here we go again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But that's not the point here.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Why didn't you do it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why didn't you do it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because I was a senator with a Republican president.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I will be the president and we will get it done.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you were not an effective senator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Look, he has now said repeatedly, ""30 years this and 30 years that.""",0,0,1,0,0,0
So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm very glad to do so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.",1,0,0,1,1,1
Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.",1,0,0,1,0,1
Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.,1,0,0,0,0,1
I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
She said a lot of things that were false.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because she has been a disaster as a senator.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.",1,0,1,0,1,1
And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.,1,0,1,0,0,1
Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.,1,0,1,0,1,1
They're interested in keeping Assad in power.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I've stood up to Russia.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I did as secretary of state.,1,0,0,0,0,0
That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.,1,1,0,0,0,1
It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.,1,0,1,0,1,1
So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...",0,0,0,1,1,0
"I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...",0,0,0,0,0,0
But you were in contact -- excuse me.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Obama draws the line in the sand.,0,0,0,0,1,0
It was laughed at all over the world what happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.",0,0,1,1,1,1
Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Russia is new in terms of nuclear.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.,0,0,1,1,0,0
"Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad.",1,0,1,0,0,0
She talks in favor of the rebels.,1,0,0,0,0,0
She doesn't even know who the rebels are.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And you know what happens?,0,0,0,0,0,0
They end up being worse than the people.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.,0,0,0,1,0,0
"And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.",1,1,1,1,1,1
I'm sure you probably have heard that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.",0,0,0,0,0,1
We sign a peace treaty.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.",1,0,1,1,1,1
But look at that deal.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Iran now and Russia are now against us.,1,0,1,0,0,0
So she wants to fight.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She wants to fight for rebels.,1,0,0,0,0,0
You don't even know who the rebels are.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And one thing I have to say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.",1,0,1,0,0,0
And Iran is killing ISIS.,1,0,1,0,1,0
And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think you have to knock out ISIS.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.",1,0,1,0,0,1
We have people that want to fight both at the same time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But Syria is no longer Syria.,0,0,1,0,0,1
"Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I believe we have to get ISIS.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.,0,0,1,0,0,0
She had a chance to do something with Syria.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that was the line.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I think that it basically has fallen.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Let me tell you something.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You take a look at Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.",0,0,1,0,0,0
They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.",1,0,1,0,0,0
Why can't they do it quietly?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?",0,0,0,0,0,0
How stupid is our country?,0,0,1,0,0,0
I can't think of any.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I can't think of any.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm pretty good at it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And we have General Flynn.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.",1,0,0,0,1,1
I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.,0,0,0,0,0,1
We talk about it all the time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?",0,0,1,0,0,0
How -- why would these people stay there?,0,0,1,0,0,0
"... for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.",1,0,1,0,0,1
All I say is this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I would not use American ground forces in Syria.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I think that would be a very serious mistake.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.",0,0,1,0,0,1
I don't think that is a smart strategy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate...",0,0,0,0,0,0
I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.",1,0,1,0,1,0
"There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would go after Baghdadi.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.",0,0,0,0,0,1
So I think that could help.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I would also consider arming the Kurds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's really -- it's really very interesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.",1,0,1,0,1,0
I will be a president for all of our people.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.,0,0,0,0,0,0

And those are the people that I will appoint.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.,0,0,0,0,0,1
I represented upstate New York.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.,0,0,0,0,0,1
It goes back to the founding of our country.,1,0,0,0,0,1
But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.",1,1,0,1,0,1
"I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.",0,0,1,0,0,0
There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You mentioned the Heller decision.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.",1,0,1,0,0,1
So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The gun lobby's on his side.,1,0,0,0,0,0
They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.,1,0,1,0,1,0
"And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.",1,1,1,0,1,1
"So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.",1,1,1,0,1,0
I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.,1,0,0,0,1,1
So I'm very honored by all of that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.",0,0,1,0,0,0
It is about what's happening right now in America.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.",1,0,1,0,1,1
Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.,1,0,0,0,0,0
He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.,1,1,1,0,1,0
I will defend Planned Parenthood.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.,0,0,1,0,0,0
So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, I think it's terrible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.",1,1,0,0,1,0
"Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.",0,1,0,0,1,0
"Well, that is not what happens in these cases.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I do not believe the government should be making it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And I will stand up for that right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.",1,0,1,0,1,0
"In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.",1,0,1,0,1,1
You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
Drugs are pouring in through the border.,1,0,1,0,0,1
We have no country if we have no border.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Hillary wants to give amnesty.,1,0,1,1,1,0
She wants to have open borders.,1,0,0,0,1,0
"The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.",1,0,0,0,1,1
First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.,1,0,0,0,0,1
It means their job is tougher.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But they know what's going on.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They know it better than anybody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They feel we have to have strong borders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was up in New Hampshire the other day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.",0,0,1,0,0,0
All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.,1,0,1,1,0,1
It's just pouring and destroying their youth.,0,0,1,1,0,0
It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We have to have strong borders.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We have to keep the drugs out of our country.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.",0,0,0,0,1,0
We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Now, I want to build the wall.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.",1,0,0,0,1,0
We shore up the border.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.",0,0,1,0,0,1
"They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to rip families apart.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I don't want to be sending parents away from children.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We have 11 million undocumented people.,1,0,0,0,0,1
"They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.",1,0,0,0,0,1
He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.,1,0,1,1,1,1
"Now, here's what that means.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.",0,0,0,0,0,1
"And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.",0,0,1,0,1,0
I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I have been for border security for years.,1,0,0,0,0,0
I voted for border security in the United States Senate.,1,0,0,0,0,0
And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.,1,0,0,0,0,0
But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.",1,0,0,0,1,1
He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.,1,0,1,0,1,1
So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think I should respond to that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.",1,1,1,0,1,1
Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.,1,0,1,1,1,0
Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.,1,0,1,1,1,1
"Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.",0,0,1,0,1,1
But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.,1,0,1,0,1,0
We are a country of laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We either have -- and by the way...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well -- well, but she said one thing.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"I voted for border security, and there are...",1,0,0,0,0,0
There are some limited places where that was appropriate.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.",0,0,1,0,1,1
And Donald knows a lot about this.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ""You complain, I'll get you deported.""",1,1,1,0,1,1
"I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.",1,0,1,0,1,0
President Obama has moved millions of people out.,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.",1,0,0,0,1,1
"She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.",1,0,1,0,0,0
As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're a country of laws.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We either have a border or we don't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We have millions of people that did it the right way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.",1,1,1,0,0,1
"You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.",0,0,1,0,0,0
But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.,1,1,1,0,1,1
We will not have open borders.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That is a rank mischaracterization.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And this used to be a bipartisan issue.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Ronald Reagan was the last president...,0,0,0,0,0,1
"... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.",1,0,0,0,0,1
"Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?",1,0,1,0,0,0
Those are the questions we need answered.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?",1,0,0,0,0,0
How did we get on to Putin?,0,0,0,0,0,0
So just to finish on the borders...,0,0,0,0,0,0
People are going to pour into our country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
People are going to come in from Syria.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.",1,0,1,1,1,1
They have no idea where they come from.,1,0,0,0,1,1
"And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.",1,0,0,0,1,0
Now we can talk about Putin.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He said nice things about me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we got along well, that would be good.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.",0,0,1,0,0,0
He has no respect for her.,0,0,0,0,1,0
He has no respect for our president.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.",1,0,1,0,1,1
"... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It's pretty clear you won't admit...,0,0,1,0,0,0
"... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.",1,1,1,1,0,0
So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.,0,0,1,0,0,0
We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.",1,1,1,1,1,1
I find that deeply disturbing.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And I think it's time you take a stand...,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.",0,1,1,0,1,0
I am not quoting myself.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hillary, you have no idea.",0,0,1,0,0,0
... 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...,0,0,1,0,0,0
And our country has no idea.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I find that just absolutely...,0,0,0,0,0,0
She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.,0,0,1,0,1,0
He's outsmarted her every step of the way.,0,0,0,0,0,0
By Russia or anybody else.,0,0,1,0,0,0
Of course I -- I don't know Putin.,1,0,1,1,0,0
This is not my best friend.,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Russians can't believe it.,0,0,1,0,0,0
She has been outsmarted by Putin.,0,0,1,0,1,0
And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They've taken over the Middle East.,0,0,1,0,1,1
She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.,0,0,1,0,1,0
And she always will be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.,1,0,1,0,0,0
"This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.",1,1,0,1,1,1

"The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.",0,0,1,0,0,1
There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.,1,0,1,0,0,1
"And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.",1,0,1,0,0,0

"As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries.",0,0,1,0,0,0
We are spending a fortune doing it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They have the bargain of the century.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.",0,1,1,0,1,1
We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.,0,0,1,0,1,1
"Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways.",1,0,1,0,0,0
This is just another lie.,0,0,0,0,0,0

So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.,0,0,0,0,0,1
That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.,1,1,0,0,1,1

"Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.",1,0,1,1,1,1
So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.",1,0,0,1,1,0
Her tax plan is a disaster.,0,0,1,0,0,0
And she can say all she wants about college tuition.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And I'm a big proponent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.,0,0,0,0,0,0

We're going to have a lot of free trade.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.,1,1,0,0,1,1
We're bringing our jobs back.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.,0,0,1,0,0,0

That is not going to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0

China is growing at 7 percent.,1,0,0,0,1,1

That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.,0,0,0,0,1,0
Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.,1,0,0,0,1,0
She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.,0,1,1,1,1,0
She did call it the gold standard.,1,1,0,1,1,0
"And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.",1,0,1,0,0,0
And that will be as bad as NAFTA.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.",0,1,0,0,1,1
It didn't meet my test.,0,0,0,0,1,0

That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, let me just say -- let me just say.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We're going to pull the country together.,0,0,0,0,0,0

She's been doing this for 30 years.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?",0,0,1,0,0,0
You were very much involved -- excuse me.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And you do have experience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing.",1,1,1,1,1,1
How do you miss $6 billion?,0,1,0,0,0,0
"You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.",1,0,1,0,0,1
But I think it's really an important issue.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars.",0,0,0,0,1,1

It's a $1 million loan.,1,1,1,0,0,1

You would even be proud of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0

She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.,0,1,0,1,0,0
And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.,1,0,1,0,0,1
And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.,0,0,1,0,0,0
She's going to get rid of nobody.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.",1,1,1,1,0,0
Those people -- I don't know those people.,0,0,1,0,0,0
I have a feeling how they came.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I believe it was her campaign that did it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's the one and Obama that caused the violence.,0,0,1,0,1,0
"They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.",1,0,1,0,1,0

"These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And I think it's her campaign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.",1,0,1,0,0,0

"I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they were all totally -- it was all fiction.,1,0,1,0,0,0

"Now, what was his response?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.",1,1,1,0,1,0
I did not say that.,1,0,1,0,1,0
I did not say that.,1,0,1,0,1,0
"In fact, he went on to say... WALLACE: Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes.",0,0,1,0,0,0
I did not say that.,1,0,1,0,1,0
"He went on to say, ""Look at her.",0,1,0,0,0,0

"He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Nobody has more respect for women than I do.,0,0,0,0,1,0
"And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.",1,1,1,0,0,1

"She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.",1,0,0,0,1,0
He's going to probably go to jail.,0,0,1,0,0,0
This is a four-star general.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility.",0,0,1,0,0,0
And it's not just about women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.",1,0,1,1,1,0

So it's not one thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.",1,0,1,0,1,0
That is not who America is.,0,0,1,0,0,0
"And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.",1,0,0,1,1,1
You talk about women and women's rights?,0,0,0,0,0,0
So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.,1,0,1,0,1,0
These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.,1,0,1,1,0,0
And yet you take their money.,1,0,1,0,0,0

Why don't you give back the money?,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think it would be a great gesture.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Because she takes a tremendous amount of money.,1,0,0,0,0,0
