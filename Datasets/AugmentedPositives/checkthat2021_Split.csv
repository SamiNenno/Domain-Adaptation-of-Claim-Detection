"As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn't even be talking, and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration.",1
It wouldn't even be a big subject.,1
When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare.,1
"All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.",1
"And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund.",1
And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.,1
"What he's said is government should pay for everyone's health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless.",1
He said I was in favor of Libya?,1
"The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know.",1
"And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to.",1
We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before so that's the way it goes.,1
I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan.,1
"In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number.",1
"I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time.",1
Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves.,1
"People -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress.",1
"Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they're not giving classified information.",1

"It's a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone.",1
"We're losing now over $500 billion in terms of imbalance with China, $75 billion a year imbalance with Japan.",1
We were hundreds of billions of dollars over budget.,1
Hundreds of billions of dollars over-budget.,1
Now you know the country's we're talking about and these were countries picked by Obama.,1
We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people.,1
"I would like it clear though, since we're talking about polls, I beat Hillary Clinton by more than 11 points, and the reason it happens...",1
[ cheering ],1
This guy has a number one — the number one absentee record in the United States...,1
"Donald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once, not twice, not three times.",1
Ten times.,1
"Well, look, you know, when a family flies into the World Trade Center, a man flies into the World Trade Center, and his family gets sent back to where they were going — and I think most of you know where they went — and, by the way, it wasn't Iraq — but they went back to a certain territory, they knew what was happening.",1
"Ninety-eight percent approval rating, we have an ""A"" from the Better Business Bureau...",1
"Unfortunately -- unfortunately, I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate.",1
"When this campaign began, I said that we got to end the starvation minimum wage of $7.25, raise it to $15.",1
Secretary Clinton said let's raise it to $12.,1
"So, then he went to the Congress, where he has been a largely very reliable supporter of the NRA.",1
"Well, I believe that the law that Senator Sanders voted for that I voted against, giving this special protection to gun manufacturers and to dealers, is an absolute abdication of responsibility on the part of those who voted for it.",1

"And I'm the only candidate in the Democratic primary, or actually on either side, who Wall Street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running ads against.",1
But I think that anybody who's actually looked at this has concluded that I have now put out all of my emails.,1

"And by the way, women are considered a pre-existing condition by the insurance companies because they might have a baby.",1
The United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right.,1
Bernie helped write Obamacare.,1
Most of the people covered by Obamacare are on Medicaid.,1
"There are many people in America struggling with exactly what you are, in the wreckage of Obamacare, with skyrocketing premiums, with deductibles that are unaffordable, and with really limited care.",1
"Indeed, I don't know if the cameras can see this, but in 70 percent of the counties in America, on Obamacare exchanges, you have a choice of one or two health insurance plans, that's it, 70 percent of the counties in America.",1
29ers are the millions of people across this country that have been forced into part-time work that used to have full-time employment and are now working 29 hours a week because Obamacare kicks in at 30 hours a week.,1
We should not be spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other nation.,1
"And if you believe health care is a right, why on Earth did you help write Obamacare that caused six million people to have their health insurance canceled, that had them lose their doctors, and have people like LaRonda, who can't get health insurance, can't afford premiums...",1

We now have driven costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years.,1
Now we've got to get individual costs down.,1
"Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union.",1
Very little of that budget — less than 10 percent — actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism.,1
And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.,1
I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air.,1
"Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.",1

"On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year.",1
"The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants -- or however many there may be.",1
Only out of touch media elites think the biggest problem facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status.,1
President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders.,1
"Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants -- breaking the federal budget.",1

"Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.",1
92 percent — 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.,1
"This is a company called Mannatech, a maker of nutritional supplements, with which you had a 10-year relationship.",1
"They offered claims that they could cure autism, cancer, they paid $7 million to settle a deceptive marketing lawsuit in Texas, and yet you're involvement continued.",1
It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.,1
I think you called him Mark Zuckerberg's personal senator because he was in favor of the H1B.,1
"In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.",1
But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.,1
Median wages have stagnated.,1
And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.,1
"If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now.",1
"If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse.",1
"And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor — very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.",1
"When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women?",1
It looked like very few women.,1
Very few children.,1
"Unfortunately, Governor Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood.",1

"In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.",1
"And by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.",1
"And when he did, he followed this bizarre pattern that he followed year after year, where he refused to say the words ""radical Islamic terror.""",1

She voted in favour of the war in Iraq.,1
I think we should ban fracking.,1
I have great disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.,1

"I believe that if my opponent should win this race, which I really don't believe, it will happen, we will have a second amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is now.",1

"And what I wanted to say was that you pointed out, Chris, that I did not agree with the way in which the court applied the second amendment in this case, because the District of Columbia tried to protect toddlers from weapons and so they wanted people with weapons to keep them safe.",1
"And in fact, he said women should be punished that there is a form of punishment for women who receive abortions.",1
Hillary wants to do amnesty.,1
All the problems -- the biggest problem is heroin flowing across our southern border.,1

"We have 17-17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, originate from the highest levels of the Kremlin and are destined to influence our choice.",1
"He was in favour of more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.",1
"I want us to have the biggest job program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.",1

"But in short, the Clinton Foundation allowed 11 million people around the world with HIV AIDS to afford treatment, and that is about half of all people in the world who get treatment.",1
"Saudi Arabia gives 25 million dollars, Qatar, all these countries.",1
These are people who kill women and treat women terribly.,1
So I want to ask you now why don't you return the money you have taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so terribly?,1
"And I'd like to compare what we're doing with the Trump Foundation, taking money from other people and buying a six-foot portrait of Donald.",1

"But you know, I think what's important and what I think the Clinton campaign wasn't very well explained is this and that's the truth: the overwhelming amount of money we collect and it's a lot, but the overwhelming amount of money we collect is not running to Hillary for president, it's going to the down ticket.",1
"When I watch the deals being made, when I see what happens to some terrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care increases by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal is for us, it's a one-sided transaction in which we return 150 billion dollars to a terrorist state, really, the terrorist state number one, we made it a strong country from a really very weak country three years ago.",1
Last year we had almost $800 billion in trade deficit.,1
We had a deficit of $800 billion.,1
We've seen him insult women.,1

And we have to be sure that Muslims come and report when they see something.,1
"As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs in the whole apartment of the two people who killed 14 and wounded many, many people.",1
And Hillary Clinton wants to allow an increase of 550 percent over Obama.,1
"People come to our country as if we had no idea who they are, where they come from, what their feelings for our country are, and they want 550 percent more.",1
"And in fact, you can look at the propaganda on many sides of the terrorists, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters because they want to wage a war between us.",1

"First she was there as Secretary of State with the so-called line in the sand, the...",1
"But our nuclear program has fallen a long way back, and they've gone crazy with their nuclear program.",1
We're old.,1
We're exhausted in the nuclear field.,1

"And by the way, ISIS has a good part of its oil.",1
"Well, what Russia did to Assad and, by the way, to Iran, which you made very powerfully with the stupidest deal I've ever seen in the history of deal making, the $150 billion deal in cash with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.",1

Donald was indeed one of the people who were rooted in the housing crisis.,1
"He said in 2006: ""I hope it will collapse, because then I can go in and buy something and make some money.""",1
"Independent experts have seen what I have proposed and what Donald has proposed, and basically they have said that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and in some cases penalize middle class families compared to the rich, would come into force, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and perhaps have another recession.",1
Donald thinks climate change is a scam committed by the Chinese.,1
I'm not saying that.,1

"You're going to New England, you're going to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you're going wherever you want, Minister Clinton, and you're going to see destruction where manufacturing dropped by 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.",1
They called it the gold standard of trading.,1
You said it was the best business you've ever seen.,1
We have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.,1
But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going to the Bundestag elections where I have submitted a 104-page essentially financial statement of the kind that forms they have.,1
"Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all those watching tonight, to know that he didn't pay anything with federal taxes, because the only years anyone's ever seen were a few years when he had to hand them over to state authorities when he tried to get a casino license, and they showed that he didn't pay federal tax.",1
"And when we talk about your business, you've gone bankrupt six times.",1

They pushed it very hard.,1
"But remember, Donald began his career in 1973 was sued by the Racial Discrimination Justice because he did not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he ensured that the people who worked for him understood that this was politics.",1
And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald Putin publicly invited him to hack into Americans.,1
He actually pleaded for the measures we have taken in Libya and demanded that Gadhafi be eliminated once he actually had something to do with him.,1
But I said they also have to focus on terror.,1
And that's what they're gonna do.,1
And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I won't get any credit for that -- but that was mainly because of what I said and my criticism of NATO.,1
I didn't support the war in Iraq.,1
"And my successor, John Kerry and President Obama, got a deal that ignored the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.",1
