"As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn't even be talking, and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration.",1
It wouldn't even be a big subject.,1
When they passed Obamacare they put a bailout fund in Obamacare.,1
"All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money.",1
"And, we led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund.",1
And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.,1
"What he's said is government should pay for everyone's health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless.",1
He said I was in favor of Libya?,1
"The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know.",1
"And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to.",1
We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before so that's the way it goes.,1

"I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time.",1
Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves.,1

This guy has a number one — the number one absentee record in the United States...,1

The United States is the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right.,1
Bernie helped write Obamacare.,1
Most of the people covered by Obamacare are on Medicaid.,1
"There are many people in America struggling with exactly what you are, in the wreckage of Obamacare, with skyrocketing premiums, with deductibles that are unaffordable, and with really limited care.",1
"Indeed, I don't know if the cameras can see this, but in 70 percent of the counties in America, on Obamacare exchanges, you have a choice of one or two health insurance plans, that's it, 70 percent of the counties in America.",1
29ers are the millions of people across this country that have been forced into part-time work that used to have full-time employment and are now working 29 hours a week because Obamacare kicks in at 30 hours a week.,1
We should not be spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other nation.,1
"And if you believe health care is a right, why on Earth did you help write Obamacare that caused six million people to have their health insurance canceled, that had them lose their doctors, and have people like LaRonda, who can't get health insurance, can't afford premiums...",1

We now have driven costs down to the lowest they've been in 50 years.,1
Now we've got to get individual costs down.,1
"Unfortunately, much of that budget continues to fight the old Cold War with the Soviet Union.",1
Very little of that budget — less than 10 percent — actually goes into fighting ISIS and international terrorism.,1
And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law.,1
I told you earlier all the talk of America's economic decline is political hot air.,1
"Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker.",1

"On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year.",1
"The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants -- or however many there may be.",1
Only out of touch media elites think the biggest problem facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status.,1
President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders.,1

"Not a one of them mentioned the fact that under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733.",1
92 percent — 92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama's first term belonged to women.,1
"This is a company called Mannatech, a maker of nutritional supplements, with which you had a 10-year relationship.",1
"They offered claims that they could cure autism, cancer, they paid $7 million to settle a deceptive marketing lawsuit in Texas, and yet you're involvement continued.",1
It is absolutely absurd to say that I had any kind of a relationship with them.,1
I think you called him Mark Zuckerberg's personal senator because he was in favor of the H1B.,1
"In Florida, we have the lowest in-state tuition of any state, because there's accountability, just as John said.",1

"When I watch the deals being made, when I see what happens to some terrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care increases by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal is for us, it's a one-sided transaction in which we return 150 billion dollars to a terrorist state, really, the terrorist state number one, we made it a strong country from a really very weak country three years ago.",1
Last year we had almost $800 billion in trade deficit.,1
We had a deficit of $800 billion.,1
We've seen him insult women.,1

"Indeed, I don't know if cameras can see that, but in 70 percent of the counties of America, on Obamacare exchanges, you have a choice between one or two health insurance plans, that's all, 70 percent of the counties of America.",1
The 29ers are the millions of people across the country who have been forced to work part-time who previously had a full-time job and now work 29 hours a week because Obamacare kicks at 30 hours a week.,1
We should not spend twice as much per person on health care as people in another country.,1

"In addition, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year.",1
The truth is that the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants - or whatever they are.,1
Only contactless media elites believe that the biggest problem facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who do not have legal status.,1
President Obama and Hillary Clinton have committed themselves to a flagrant breach of duty by handing over the security of the American people to the opening of borders.,1
