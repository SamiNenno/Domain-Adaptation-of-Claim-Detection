"She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.",1
She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.,1
"Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.",1
"I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that.",1
I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.,1
"Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.",1
"He went on to say, ""Look at her.",1
"I don't think so.""",1
"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice.""",1
"And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.",1
"But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.",1
"Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.",1
We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.,1
"The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.",1
I don't get anything.,1
I don't buy boats.,1
I don't buy planes.,1
What happens -- the money goes to them.,1
"Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?",1
"No, it was -- we put up the American flag.",1
"But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation...",1
But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.,1
"So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it.",1
"And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...",1
"If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.",1
"before the invasion, he supported it.",1
And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.,1
"It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.",1
Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.,1
"We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.",1
"Throughout the year, we have seen Democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we know it and take away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives.",1
"Dishonestly called “Medicare for All,” the Democratic proposal would establish a government-run, single-payer health care system that eliminates all private and employer-based health care plans and would cost an astonishing $32.6 trillion during its first 10 years.",1
"As a candidate, I promised that we would protect coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions and create new health care insurance options that would lower premiums.",1
"I have kept that promise, and we are now seeing health insurance premiums coming down.",1
I also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare.,1
Democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing Medicare by more than $800 billion over 10 years to pay for Obamacare.,1
"By eliminating Medicare as a program for seniors, and outlawing the ability of Americans to enroll in private and employer-based plans, the Democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care.",1
"Unfortunately, they would be wrong: 123 Democrats in the House of Representatives — 64 percent of House Democrats — as well as 15 Democrats in the Senate have already formally co-sponsored this legislation.",1
Democrats want open-borders socialism.,1
"Indeed, the Democrats' commitment to government-run health care is all the more menacing to our seniors and our economy when paired with some Democrats' absolute commitment to end enforcement of our immigration laws by abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",1
Today’s Democratic Party is for open-borders socialism.,1
U.S. Steel is opening up a minimum of eight plants.,1
"But here, there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint.",1
They didn’t know the location.,1
They didn’t know the time.,1
They didn’t know the year.,1
They didn’t know anything.,1
"If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, ""They don’t do this""",1
"You can check with Fox, because they covered it very strongly — who got paid.",1
I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me.,1
"But one had a mortgage paid off her house, $52,000.",1
They took money in order to say bad things.,1
"Because a normal, regular, political person that has no concept of what the hell he’s doing would let China continue to take $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuild their country.",1
"If you look at McCabe taking $700,000 from a Hillary Clinton-PAC essentially run by Terry McAuliffe, who’s her best friend in the world, and he gives them hundreds of thousands of dollars.",1
We’re getting another $1.6 billion in borders.,1
We’ve spent $3.2 [billion] and we’re getting another $1.6 [billion].,1
Dairy products — 300 percent.,1
Three hundred percent.,1
"It’s — basically, they’re saying, ""We don’t have any barriers. By the way, it’s 300 percent""",1
"They’re having riots in every city, far greater than they were during the green period with President Obama.",1
"When President Obama stuck up for government, not the people.",1
"Saying about, ""Oh, you got to stop Trump. You got to stop him. You got to vote against him""",1
Because they had a VAT tax of 17 percent and nobody from this country knew that.,1
And the Los Angeles Times has us 6 points up nationwide.,1
And for the most part we haven’t even started spending our money yet.,1
We have a president — and frankly Hillary — who don’t use the words radical Islamic terrorism.,1
"They’re concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is killed, violently, on the streets, which is happening all over our country.",1
Now you know she’s very much against the Second Amendment.,1
She wants to destroy your Second Amendment.,1
She doesn’t want guns.,1
It’s the same reason why she won’t take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS all over the world.,1
Her policies have created disaster overseas and poverty at home.,1
Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working.,1
Can’t get a job.,1
We lost our jobs.,1
It got worse.,1
"Far worse now, it’s a total catastrophe.",1
And she does not have the energy.,1
And in my opinion she is totally unfit to be the president of the United States.,1
"If we lower our taxes and we’re getting a massive tax reduction — and by the way, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes substantially.",1
This alone will instantly save another two million jobs.,1
"And by the way, on Nov. 1, just before the election on Nov. 8, new numbers are coming out which will show 40, 50, 60 percent increases.",1
They want to delay it until after the election because it’s election — it’s a disaster.,1
Bill Clinton.,1
You look at all of these different places have been destroyed.,1
Absolutely destroyed.,1
And we’re bringing our education local.,1
Since President Obama came into office another two million Hispanic Americans have fallen into poverty.,1
You ever see her 18-minute speech?,1
"And frankly, when they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising I don’t have to because I do it the old fashioned way.",1
Now that is a first in the history of Air Force One.,1
Air Force One has never been treated so badly in its long and incredible history.,1
Nobody had guns on the other side.,1
"If there were guns on the other side, just a few of them, number one, probably if they knew, they wouldn’t have attacked.",1
"And if they had protection, if they had guns on the other side, with the bullets flying the other direction, it would’ve been a whole different story.",1
"They just announced yesterday they’re moving their small car division, the whole thing, into Mexico.",1
And Hillary Clinton has already said she’s going to put the miners out of business.,1
"Consumer confidence, business confidence, and manufacturing confidence are the highest they have been in many decades.",1
"Since my election, we’ve created 2.4 million jobs, and that number is going up very, very substantially.",1
New unemployment claims are near the lowest we’ve seen in almost half a century.,1
"African American unemployment has reached the lowest rate ever recorded in the United States, and so has unemployment among Hispanic Americans.",1
"The tax cut bill is expected to raise the average American’s household income by more than $4,000.",1
This is especially true because we have undertaken the most extensive regulatory reduction ever conceived.,1
I am pleased to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has retaken almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria.,1
"When you look at all of the different charts and polls, and you see, as an example, African American unemployment at the historic low — it’s never had a period of time like this.",1
Same with Hispanic.,1
Women at a 17-year low.,1
"And then, in all fairness, I was saying to Klaus last night: Had the opposing party to me won — some of whom you backed, some of the people in the room — instead of being up almost 50 percent — the stock market is up since my election almost 50 percent — rather than that, I believe the stock market from that level, the initial level, would have been down close to 50 percent.",1
A lot of the wall is built.,1
It's been very effective.,1
"If you look at San Diego, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent once the wall was up.",1
"El Paso, illegal traffic dropped 72 percent, then ultimately 95 percent, once the wall was up.",1
"In Tucson, Arizona, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent.",1
"Yuma, it dropped illegal traffic 95 to 96 percent.",1
It dropped virtually 100 percent in the areas where the wall is.,1
"So, I mean, it's very effective.",1
"People are pouring into our country, including terrorists.",1
We caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time.,1
But we caught 10 terrorists.,1
The economy has — people are losing their jobs.,1
"Well, we have the lowest unemployment that we've had in 50 years.",1
"People with tremendous medical difficulty and medical problems are pouring in, and in many — in many cases, it's contagious.",1
"The last time, Chuck, you shut it down —",1
We have the votes on Graham-Cassidy.,1
"In recent years, Indiana has welcomed dozens of companies fleeing high taxes and high-tax states.",1
Thousands of new jobs and massive capital investment have followed — meaning a better quality of life for the people of Indiana.,1
Unemployment is at a 16-year low.,1
Unemployment for African Americans is near its lowest point since the turn of the millennium.,1
Wages are rising.,1

More than 90 percent of Americans use assistance to prepare their taxes.,1
"To protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer, we are finally ending the crushing, the horrible, the unfair estate tax, or as it is often referred to, the death tax.",1
The farmers in particular are affected.,1
"They have wonderful farms, but they can’t pay the tax, so they have to sell the farm.",1
So that death tax is a disaster for this country and a disaster for so many small businesses and farmers.,1
"But that great heritage could come to an end because of the death tax, or the estate tax, and could make it impossible for him to pass that legacy to his wonderful family.",1
"Today, our total business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average foreign competitor in the developed world.",1
"Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.",1

"In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings.",1

"Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier.",1
"At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.",1

These are the facts: Decades of progress in reducing crime are now being reversed by this government's step backwards in the execution of sentences.,1

Egypt was handed over to the radical Muslim Brotherhood and forced the military to regain control.,1
Iran is on its way to nuclear weapons.,1
"And when a foreign minister illegally stores their emails on a private server, 33,000 of them delete so that the authorities can't see their crime, put our country in danger, lie about it in any other form, and have no consequence of it – I know that corruption in our country has reached a level that has never been in our country before.",1
"My opponent has demanded a radical 50% increase in Syria, remember.",1
"550 percent more Syrian refugees, in addition to the existing massive refugee flows that are already coming to our country under President Obama's leadership.",1

"But what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they spend on welfare, prisons, and education, all of which have fallen by hundreds of millions of dollars.",1
"But I also think that if you claim that you are the only one who has included this in the campaign, you acknowledge, for example, that you are only one person on this stage who has ever been punished for hiring people to work illegally on your projects.",1
And he had to pay a million dollars in a verdict from the...,1
Completely wrong.,1
"Trump Polish workers, you will see a million dollars for hiring illegal workers in one of his projects.",1
That's what happened.,1
"If you look at the eight members of the gang, Donald gave over $50,000 to three Democrats and two Republicans.",1
"And by the way, Marco is right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to illegally recruit people and file a $1 million verdict against him.",1
"And you know, there's a reason why when Harry Reid was asked by all the people on this stage he wants the most, who he likes the most, Harry Reid Donald - Donald Trump said.",1
"Because Donald supported him in the past, and he knows he can make a deal with him.",1
I'm financing my own campaign.,1
I'm the only one who finances my own campaign.,1
"I want to end it because it goes too far, it killed millions of jobs and it hurts people's health care.",1
"But of the more than 400,000 jobs we have created in the state, we think that maybe 15,000 are linked to this industry because it is in the early stages.",1
"I'm going to give absolutely my return, but I'm going to be tested for two or three years now, so I can't do it until the exam is complete, obviously.",1

I never talked about this subject.,1
"Well, it's true that now that the spotlight here in New York is pretty bright, some things have been said and Senator Sanders has called me unqualified.",1
It was a first time.,1
"Let's talk about super-PACs and 501(c)(4)s, money that's completely undiscovered.",1
And I supported...,1
- I supported the fight for 15.,1
"I took my word from the Democrats in the Senate, led by Senator Patty Murray and others, like my good friend Kirsten Gillibrand, who said that we're putting a national level of $12 and then any place that can go about it to go about it.",1
And I think the goal to get to $12 is to go the way to encourage others to get to $15.,1
"Well, the facts are that most of the weapons that end up committing crimes in New York come from the state.",1
They come from states that have no serious efforts to control weapons that we do in New York.,1
"But as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry gave the maximum amount to Clinton's campaign.",1
I would just like to point out that the Senate voted whether the United States should support the Libyan people's efforts to protect itself from the threats of Gadhafi's genocide threats and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek support in the Security Council.,1
"Senator Sanders voted in favour, and that is exactly what we have done.",1
"Well, you know what, I have certainly always supported Libya in moving to democracy.",1

Do you think there is a reason why a Republican has the courage to realize that climate change is real and that we need to change our energy system?,1
"And I always go back to it because part of the reason the Wall Street guys are trying so hard to stop me -- the hedge fund guys, the shadow bank guys -- is because I have their number on all of this.",1
"When you ran against Senator Obama, you thought he was naive because he thought it would be a good idea to talk to our enemies.",1
"Democrats win when there is a big turnout, when people are excited, when workers, middle class and young people are willing to get involved in the political process.",1
"Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small turnout, which is, by the way, the reason why they love voter suppression.",1
"If there's a big turnout, we're not just keeping the White House, but I think we're winning the Senate back.",1
"So I think if you want to keep the White House, if you want to see how Democrats are doing well across borders, then our campaign is the one that creates the big turnout and helps us win.",1
"Your campaign has now been criticized for its agents, who essentially represent culinary union members with union needles in Nevada, and the Nashua Telegraph has recently complained that you misindicated in an advertisement that they had supported you when they didn't.",1
"As far as the last one is concerned, as I understand it, we did not propose that we should have the approval of a newspaper.",1
"So we never said, never said anyone, a newspaper supports us, that's not.",1
"That was just something -- as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads, and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none that said that these newspapers had supported us.",1
In the 1990s you supported NAFTA.,1
But you refused when you ran for president in 2008.,1
"As Secretary of State, you supported TPP, and then -- which, of course, is this trade agreement with many Asian countries, but you're against it now when you make your second offer for President.",1
"When I saw what was the result, I opposed it.",1
"I don't think that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is to say to American workers, hey, you are now in competition against people in Vietnam who earn 56 cents per hour minimum wage.",1
I don't want American workers competing against people who earn 56 cents an hour.,1
"But the current trade agreements in the last 30 years have been written by companies America, for companies America, led to the loss of millions of decently paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decently paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race down where employers say, ""Hey, you don't want to cut wages? We're going to China.""",1

"But Hillary Clinton actually described this moment as an example of implicit bias in the police, where -- where she used -- when she was asked a week ago in the debate whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there was implicit bias in all the US.",1
"Senator, why would Hillary Clinton, when African-American police officers involved in a police operation were involved in an African-American shooting, accuse these African-American police officers of implicit bias?",1
"You just heard that they have a plan for open borders, amnesty.",1
"And lastly and dangerously, Donald Trump believes -- Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons.",1
"He says Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them.",1
"And when he was confronted with it and said, wait a minute, terrorists could get this, the spread could lead to a nuclear war, here's what Donald Trump said, and I quote, ""Go ahead, people, have fun.""",1
That's why Donald Trump's claim that he wants -- that NATO is out of date and that we have to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.,1
And all the investigations came to the conclusion that no reasonable prosecutor would take another step.,1
And a Republican FBI director conducted an investigation and came to the conclusion that...,1

But what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine by her side to support a practice like partial abortion.,1
"When I watch the deals being made, when I see what happens to some terrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care increases by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal is for us, it's a one-sided transaction in which we return 150 billion dollars to a terrorist state, really, the terrorist state number one, we made it a strong country from a really very weak country three years ago.",1
Last year we had almost $800 billion in trade deficit.,1
We had a deficit of $800 billion.,1

"Well, you owe the president an apology, because, as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner you have -- and he's the one who started this, along with your campaign manager, and they were on TV two weeks ago, she was, that's exactly what said.",1
"There's never been anything like that where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after you get the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you wash them or, as you would say, make them very expensive.",1

"And I'm telling you, Hillary Clinton increases your taxes, people.",1
It increases your taxes very much.,1
"But it increases your taxes, and I reduce your taxes.",1
But it massively increases the taxes of all.,1
"And in fact, the way he talks about his tax cuts would increase taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.",1
"And I think it was unfortunate, but it happened that since the Great Recession, the profits have all gone to the top.",1
"I mean, she and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they came out of Iraq, the vacuum they left, that's why the ISIS has even formed.",1
So we have a treaty to reduce nuclear weapons.,1
"And by the way, ISIS has a good part of its oil.",1
"Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, may be the biggest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.",1
It has deprived us of the production of jobs.,1

At the moment there are investigations everywhere — hundreds of refugees are under federal investigation for terrorist and related reasons.,1
I have 306 voter votes.,1
I guess it was the biggest win since Ronald Reagan.,1
We even had to go faster than we thought because we got a bad decision from a circle that was overturned with a record number.,1
"Since my election, Ford has announced that he will abandon his plans to build a new factory in Mexico and instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.",1
"Fiat-Chrysler announced that it would invest a billion dollars in Ohio and Michigan and create 2,000 new American jobs.",1

I also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect health insurance.,1
Democrats have already hurt older people by cutting over $800 billion in health insurance over 10 years to pay Obamacare.,1
