"She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.",1
She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.,1
"Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.",1
"I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that.",1
I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.,1
"Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.",1
"He went on to say, ""Look at her.",1
"I don't think so.""",1
"About another woman, he said, ""That wouldn't be my first choice.""",1
"And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.",1
"But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.",1
"Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.",1
We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.,1
"The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.",1
I don't get anything.,1
I don't buy boats.,1
I don't buy planes.,1
What happens -- the money goes to them.,1
"Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?",1
"No, it was -- we put up the American flag.",1
"But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation...",1
But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.,1
"So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it.",1

"Throughout the year, we have seen Democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we know it and take away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives.",1
"Dishonestly called “Medicare for All,” the Democratic proposal would establish a government-run, single-payer health care system that eliminates all private and employer-based health care plans and would cost an astonishing $32.6 trillion during its first 10 years.",1
"As a candidate, I promised that we would protect coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions and create new health care insurance options that would lower premiums.",1
"I have kept that promise, and we are now seeing health insurance premiums coming down.",1
I also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare.,1
Democrats have already harmed seniors by slashing Medicare by more than $800 billion over 10 years to pay for Obamacare.,1
"By eliminating Medicare as a program for seniors, and outlawing the ability of Americans to enroll in private and employer-based plans, the Democratic plan would inevitably lead to the massive rationing of health care.",1
"Unfortunately, they would be wrong: 123 Democrats in the House of Representatives — 64 percent of House Democrats — as well as 15 Democrats in the Senate have already formally co-sponsored this legislation.",1
Democrats want open-borders socialism.,1
"Indeed, the Democrats' commitment to government-run health care is all the more menacing to our seniors and our economy when paired with some Democrats' absolute commitment to end enforcement of our immigration laws by abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",1
Today’s Democratic Party is for open-borders socialism.,1
U.S. Steel is opening up a minimum of eight plants.,1
"But here, there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint.",1
They didn’t know the location.,1

They didn’t know anything.,1
"If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, ""They don’t do this""",1
"You can check with Fox, because they covered it very strongly — who got paid.",1
I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me.,1
"But one had a mortgage paid off her house, $52,000.",1
They took money in order to say bad things.,1
"Because a normal, regular, political person that has no concept of what the hell he’s doing would let China continue to take $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuild their country.",1
"If you look at McCabe taking $700,000 from a Hillary Clinton-PAC essentially run by Terry McAuliffe, who’s her best friend in the world, and he gives them hundreds of thousands of dollars.",1
We’re getting another $1.6 billion in borders.,1
We’ve spent $3.2 [billion] and we’re getting another $1.6 [billion].,1
Dairy products — 300 percent.,1

"It’s — basically, they’re saying, ""We don’t have any barriers. By the way, it’s 300 percent""",1

Because they had a VAT tax of 17 percent and nobody from this country knew that.,1
And the Los Angeles Times has us 6 points up nationwide.,1

We have a president — and frankly Hillary — who don’t use the words radical Islamic terrorism.,1
"They’re concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is killed, violently, on the streets, which is happening all over our country.",1
Now you know she’s very much against the Second Amendment.,1
She wants to destroy your Second Amendment.,1
She doesn’t want guns.,1
It’s the same reason why she won’t take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS all over the world.,1
Her policies have created disaster overseas and poverty at home.,1
Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working.,1
Can’t get a job.,1
We lost our jobs.,1
It got worse.,1
"Far worse now, it’s a total catastrophe.",1
And she does not have the energy.,1
And in my opinion she is totally unfit to be the president of the United States.,1
"If we lower our taxes and we’re getting a massive tax reduction — and by the way, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes substantially.",1
This alone will instantly save another two million jobs.,1
"And by the way, on Nov. 1, just before the election on Nov. 8, new numbers are coming out which will show 40, 50, 60 percent increases.",1
They want to delay it until after the election because it’s election — it’s a disaster.,1

"And frankly, when they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising I don’t have to because I do it the old fashioned way.",1
Now that is a first in the history of Air Force One.,1
Air Force One has never been treated so badly in its long and incredible history.,1
Nobody had guns on the other side.,1
"If there were guns on the other side, just a few of them, number one, probably if they knew, they wouldn’t have attacked.",1
"And if they had protection, if they had guns on the other side, with the bullets flying the other direction, it would’ve been a whole different story.",1
"They just announced yesterday they’re moving their small car division, the whole thing, into Mexico.",1
And Hillary Clinton has already said she’s going to put the miners out of business.,1

"African American unemployment has reached the lowest rate ever recorded in the United States, and so has unemployment among Hispanic Americans.",1

Same with Hispanic.,1

"And then, in all fairness, I was saying to Klaus last night: Had the opposing party to me won — some of whom you backed, some of the people in the room — instead of being up almost 50 percent — the stock market is up since my election almost 50 percent — rather than that, I believe the stock market from that level, the initial level, would have been down close to 50 percent.",1

And I think the goal to get to $12 is to go the way to encourage others to get to $15.,1
"Well, the facts are that most of the weapons that end up committing crimes in New York come from the state.",1
They come from states that have no serious efforts to control weapons that we do in New York.,1
"But as I understand it, 43 lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry gave the maximum amount to Clinton's campaign.",1
I would just like to point out that the Senate voted whether the United States should support the Libyan people's efforts to protect itself from the threats of Gadhafi's genocide threats and whether we should go to the United Nations to seek support in the Security Council.,1
"Senator Sanders voted in favour, and that is exactly what we have done.",1

"Republicans win when people are demoralized and you have a small turnout, which is, by the way, the reason why they love voter suppression.",1
"If there's a big turnout, we're not just keeping the White House, but I think we're winning the Senate back.",1
"So I think if you want to keep the White House, if you want to see how Democrats are doing well across borders, then our campaign is the one that creates the big turnout and helps us win.",1
"Your campaign has now been criticized for its agents, who essentially represent culinary union members with union needles in Nevada, and the Nashua Telegraph has recently complained that you misindicated in an advertisement that they had supported you when they didn't.",1

"So we never said, never said anyone, a newspaper supports us, that's not.",1
"That was just something -- as the secretary knows, you put titles on ads, and you send them out, but there was no word in that ad, none that said that these newspapers had supported us.",1
In the 1990s you supported NAFTA.,1
But you refused when you ran for president in 2008.,1
"As Secretary of State, you supported TPP, and then -- which, of course, is this trade agreement with many Asian countries, but you're against it now when you make your second offer for President.",1
"When I saw what was the result, I opposed it.",1
"I don't think that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is to say to American workers, hey, you are now in competition against people in Vietnam who earn 56 cents per hour minimum wage.",1
I don't want American workers competing against people who earn 56 cents an hour.,1
"But the current trade agreements in the last 30 years have been written by companies America, for companies America, led to the loss of millions of decently paying jobs, 60,000 factories in America lost since 2001, millions of decently paying jobs; and also a downward spiral, a race down where employers say, ""Hey, you don't want to cut wages?

"But Hillary Clinton actually described this moment as an example of implicit bias in the police, where -- where she used -- when she was asked a week ago in the debate whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there was implicit bias in all the US.",1
"Senator, why would Hillary Clinton, when African-American police officers involved in a police operation were involved in an African-American shooting, accuse these African-American police officers of implicit bias?",1
"You just heard that they have a plan for open borders, amnesty.",1
"And lastly and dangerously, Donald Trump believes -- Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons.",1
"He says Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them.",1
"And when he was confronted with it and said, wait a minute, terrorists could get this, the spread could lead to a nuclear war, here's what Donald Trump said, and I quote, ""Go ahead, people, have fun.""",1
That's why Donald Trump's claim that he wants -- that NATO is out of date and that we have to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.,1

"When I watch the deals being made, when I see what happens to some terrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care increases by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal is for us, it's a one-sided transaction in which we return 150 billion dollars to a terrorist state, really, the terrorist state number one, we made it a strong country from a really very weak country three years ago.",1
Last year we had almost $800 billion in trade deficit.,1
We had a deficit of $800 billion.,1
"So you can say how you want to say it, but Bill Clinton has abused women.",1

"Her client, who represented her, took him out, and she saw her laugh on two separate occasions and laughed at the girl who was raped.",1
"Well, you owe the president an apology, because, as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner you have -- and he's the one who started this, along with your campaign manager, and they were on TV two weeks ago, she was, that's exactly what said.",1

"And I think it was unfortunate, but it happened that since the Great Recession, the profits have all gone to the top.",1
"I mean, she and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they came out of Iraq, the vacuum they left, that's why the ISIS has even formed.",1
So we have a treaty to reduce nuclear weapons.,1

"In addition, the current agreement blocks the development of clean coal in America, which it does, and the mines are starting to open.",1
China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal-fired power plants.,1
"So we can't build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement.",1

"Dishonestly called ""Medicare for All"", the democratic proposal would create a state-run, affordable health system that would eliminate all private and employer-based health plans and cost an amazing $32.6 trillion in the first 10 years.",1
"As a candidate, I promised that we would protect cover for patients with pre-existing conditions and create new health insurance options that would reduce premiums.",1
"I kept this promise, and we now see that health insurance premiums are falling.",1
I have also given our great seniors a solemn promise to protect Medicare.,1
Democrats have already hurt older people by cutting Medicare by more than $800 billion over 10 years to pay for Obamacare.,1
"By eliminating Medicare as a program for seniors and banning the ability of Americans to get involved in private and employer-based plans, the democratic plan would inevitably lead to massive rationing of health care.",1

The Democrats want an open socialism.,1

"If we lower our taxes and we get a massive tax cut — and by the way, Hillary Clinton increases your taxes considerably.",1

Democrats have already hurt older people by cutting over $800 billion in health insurance over 10 years to pay Obamacare.,1
